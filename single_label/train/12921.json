{"id":12921,"title":"Piperazine derivatives inhibit PrP/PrP(res) propagation in vitro and in vivo.","abstract":"Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders, which are not curable and no effective treatment exists so far. The major neuropathological change in diseased brains is the conversion of the normal cellular form of the prion protein PrPc(C) into a disease-associated isoform PrP(Sc). PrP(Sc) accumulates into multimeres and fibrillar aggregates, which leads to the formation of amyloid plaques. Increasing evidence indicates a fundamental role of PrP(Sc) species and its aggregation in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, which initiates the pathological cascade and leads to neurodegeneration accompanied by spongiform changes. In search of compounds that have the potential to interfere with PrP(Sc) formation and propagation, we used a cell based assay for the screening of potential aggregation inhibitors. The assay deals with a permanently prion infected cell line that was adapted for a high-throughput screening of a compound library composed of 10,000 compounds (DIVERset 2, ChemBridge). We could detect six different classes of highly potent inhibitors of PrP(Sc) propagation in vitro and identified piperazine derivatives as a new inhibitory lead structure, which increased incubation time of scrapie infected mice.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502948","annotations":[{"name":"Scrapie","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapie"},{"name":"Prion","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_spongiform_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.600431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.598854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.577081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Piperazine","weight":0.541559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperazine"},{"name":"Neuropathology","weight":0.444711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology"},{"name":"Fibril","weight":0.399276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Drug discovery hit to lead","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery_hit_to_lead"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"}]}
