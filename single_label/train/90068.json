{"id":90068,"title":"[Characteristics of treating dislocation and fracture of sacroiliac joint through anterior and posterior approches].","abstract":"To investigate characteristics of treating dislocation and fracture of sacroiliac joint through anterior and posterior approaches.Between January 2006 and September 2012, 39 patients with dislocations and fractures of sacroiliac joint were treated with operation. There were 28 males and 11 females, aged 12 to 64 (mean, 41.3) years old. Seventeen cases were chosen through anterior approach, 13 cases through posterior and 9 cases were combined with anterior and posterior approaches. The anterior approach were made with supine position, performed open reduction, and two plates with 4 holes were used as internal fixation for arthrodesis of sacroiliac joint after reduction; while posterior approach prone position, close or open reduction was performed, and one or two partial thread lag screws, which with 7.3 mm in diameter and 60 to 75 mm in length, were penetrated via sacroiliac joint for fixation under X-ray. Postoperative complications were observed, Matta and Majeed scoring were used to evaluated currative effects.All patients were followed up from 6 to 36 months. The patient could sit on the bed 2 to 4 weeks after surgery and walk with a crane 6 weeks' later. No breakage or loosening of screw occurred during follow-up. In all but one case with old sacral iliac fractures reducted poor, others obtained good opposition. According to Matta's criteria, 30 cases got excellent results, 8 good and 1 fair. According to Majeed's funtional standard, 14 patients got excellent results, 20 good 4 fair and 1 poor.Treating dislocation and fracture of sacroiliac joint through anterior and posterior approaches can obtain good effects. However, anatomic location, fracture types, degree of displacement, the rate of preoperational reduction, vulnerability assessment of operation and fixation strength should be considered.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654525","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.605816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.509903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.354837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"},{"name":"Sacroiliac joint","weight":0.352778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliac_joint"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.343866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.330415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.167861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Vulnerability assessment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_assessment"},{"name":"Arthrodesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrodesis"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75_mm_Gun_M2/M3/M6"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Lag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Crane (machine)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine)"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.0148293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Electron hole","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole"},{"name":"Piaget's theory of cognitive development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget's_theory_of_cognitive_development"},{"name":"Prone position","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prone_position"}]}
