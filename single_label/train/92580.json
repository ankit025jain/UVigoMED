{"id":92580,"title":"Tim-3 polymorphism downregulates gene expression and is involved in the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis.","abstract":"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the sacroiliac joints and the spine. T-cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule 3 (TIM-3) has been established as a negative regulatory molecule that plays a critical role in controlling inflammation. Studies have shown that polymorphisms in TIM-3 gene may be associated with inflammatory diseases. The current study investigated the association between polymorphisms in the TIM-3 gene and susceptibility to AS, and it examined the effects of these polymorphisms on gene expression. Two polymorphisms in TIM-3 -574G/T and +4259T/G polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 282 AS patients and 298 healthy controls. Results showed that frequency of the TIM-3 -574GT genotype was significantly increased in cases than in controls (Odd ratio [OR]=2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39-4.48, p=0.002). Similarly, TIM-3 -574T allele revealed a positive association with the disease (OR=2.39, p=0.002). The TIM-3 +4259T/G polymorphism did not show any correlation with AS. We further evaluated TIM-3 mRNA and protein levels in CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and monocytes from subjects carrying different TIM-3 genotypes. Results revealed that subjects carrying polymorphic -574GT genotype had significantly lower TIM-3 mRNA and protein levels in CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and monocytes than those with wild-type GG genotype. These data suggest that TIM-3 polymorphism is associated with increased susceptibility to AS possibly by downregulating gene expression.
