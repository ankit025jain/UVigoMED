{"id":14330,"title":"Beneficial effects of intra-arterial and intravenous prostaglandin E1 in intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury.","abstract":"Ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is encountered in conditions that diminish intestinal blood flow. There is no clinically feasible technique available for mucosal preservation.One hundred Wistar rats were subjected to intestinal ischaemia for 15 and 60 min (I15', I60'), followed by 1 and 7 days of reperfusion (R1d, R7d). Rats were subjected to ischaemia by clamping the superior mesenteric artery. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (2.500 ng/kg intra-arterial bolus or 20 ng/kg intravenous infusion) was administered immediately prior to the commencement of the experimental period. Animals were divided into 20 groups: sham (laparotomy alone), sacrificed at 1 or 7 days; saline administration, 15 or 60 min of ischaemia, 1 or 7 days of reperfusion; prostaglandin E1 administration, 15 or 60 min of ischaemia, 1 or 7 days of reperfusion, each one for intra-arterial or intravenous administration. Ileal segments were excised and assessed for histopathological score, polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes encountered and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity measurement.I/R caused deterioration of histological characteristics. Prophylactic administration of PGE1 resulted in a significant decrease in the histological score compared with the respective saline group (analysis of variance, P < 0.005). In groups treated with PGE1, PMN leucocyte infiltration was lower for the 60 min of ischaemia group (I60'/R1d *P = 0.026; I60'/R7d P = 0.015). I15'/R7d did not lead to a significant reduction in PMN infiltration (P = 0.061). Pretreatment with PGE1 attenuates MPO levels after intestinal I/R injury (P < 0.05). No differences were encountered between types of administration.Results of this study showed that administration of prostaglandin E1 prevents I/R injury by diminishing histological damage parameters, inhibiting PMN leucocyte infiltration and attenuating MPO activity.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24431002","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.700684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.685794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.672465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.635169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.598725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Superior mesenteric artery","weight":0.590798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_artery"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.55676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.528835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.501224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.454352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.376917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.37097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.273852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E1","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E1"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.172762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.127545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.119821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"}]}
