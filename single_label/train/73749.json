{"id":73749,"title":"Expression of heparanase in soft tissue sarcomas of adults.","abstract":"Heparanase is an endo-?-D-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans, resulting in the disassembly of the extracellular matrix. Heparanase has a central role in the development of various tumors, and its expression has been associated with increased tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, but there is insufficient information about the function of heparanase in sarcomas.1) To evaluate heparanase levels in adult soft tissue sarcomas (STS); 2) To examine the correlation between heparanase levels and pathological and clinical parameters and treatment outcome.Pathological specimens of primary or metastatic STS were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis applying an anti-heparanase antibody. The clinical and the pathological data, together with the data of heparanase levels, were evaluated in a logistic regression model for tumor recurrence and survival.One hundred and one samples were examined, 55 from primary tumors and 46 from metastatic sites. A high expression of heparanase was observed in 29 (52.7%) and 22 specimens (47.8%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between heparanase expressions in the primary vs. metastatic sites of tumors. Moreover, no correlation was observed between heparanase staining and tumor aggressiveness, tumor recurrence or patient survival in various groups of patients.Expression of heparanase was observed in 50% of the STS, in various histological subtypes. A larger study with homogenous groups of specific sub-types of STS or stages of disease is required to validate over-expression of heparanase as a marker of disease aggressiveness.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887057","annotations":[{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heparan sulfate","weight":0.801548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparan_sulfate"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Proteoglycan","weight":0.668283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteoglycan"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.503506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.498684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.474015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.454937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.438205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Soft-tissue sarcoma","weight":0.24988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-tissue_sarcoma"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.219121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.163435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
