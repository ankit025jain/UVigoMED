{"id":82802,"title":"Zinc induces apatite and scholzite formation during dentin remineralization.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to ascertain whether zinc may improve the repair ability of demineralized dentin. Dentin disks were demineralized by phosphoric acid during 15 s and immersed in artificial saliva, remineralizing solution, a zinc chloride solution and a zinc oxide solution. Dentin specimens were analyzed after 24 h and 1 month of storage. Surface morphology was assessed by atomic force and scanning electron microscopy, mechanical properties were analyzed by nanohardness testing in a TriboIndenter, and chemical changes at the surfaces were determined by X-ray diffraction, Raman and energy-dispersive elemental analyses. After phosphoric acid application, dentin was only partially demineralized. Demineralized dentin was remineralized after 24 h of storage in any of the tested solutions (nanohardness increased and hydroxylapatite formation was detected by Raman). Remineralization was maintained up to 1 month in dentin stored in remineralizing solution, zinc chloride and zinc oxide. Zinc and phosphate were important for hydroxylapatite homeostasis. Scholzite formation was encountered in dentin stored in zinc-containing solutions. Zinc might allow to reach the balance between dentin demineralization and remineralization processes.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513585","annotations":[{"name":"Apatite","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite"},{"name":"Zinc oxide","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_oxide"},{"name":"Hydroxylapatite","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite"},{"name":"Phosphoric acid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.780873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.741161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Zinc chloride","weight":0.723868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_chloride"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.640199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Electrolysis","weight":0.639347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis"},{"name":"Atomic force microscopy","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Diffraction","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.405901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.318918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.163251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Elemental analysis","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elemental_analysis"},{"name":"Raman spectroscopy","weight":0.121581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Remineralisation of teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remineralisation_of_teeth"},{"name":"List of materials properties","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_materials_properties"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Hard disk drive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Electromagnetic induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction"},{"name":"Storage tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_tank"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Process (science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(science)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
