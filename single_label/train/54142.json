{"id":54142,"title":"First single-port laparoscopic pancreatectomy in Brazil.","abstract":"Pancreatic surgery is an extremely challenging field, and the management of pancreatic diseases continues to evolve. In the past decade, minimal access surgery is moving towards minimizing the surgical trauma by reducing numbers and size of the port. In the last few years, a novel technique with a single-incision laparoscopic approach has been described for several laparoscopic procedures.We present a single-port laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. To our knowledge, this is the first single-port pancreatic resection in Brazil and Latin America.A 33-year-old woman with neuroendocrine tumor underwent spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy via single-port approach. A single-incision advanced access platform with gelatin cap, self-retaining sleeve and wound protector was used.Operative time was 174 minutes. Blood loss was minimal, and the patient did not receive a transfusion. The recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 4.Single-port laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is feasible and can be safely performed in specialized centers by skilled laparoscopic surgeons.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474235","annotations":[{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.768149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.718494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.67637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.543214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.48616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.472666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Latin America","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.41446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.352778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Port","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"}]}
