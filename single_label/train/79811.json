{"id":79811,"title":"Relationship between fibrosis and ventricular arrhythmias in Chagas heart disease without ventricular dysfunction.","abstract":"Patients with Chagas disease and segmental wall motion abnormality (SWMA) have worse prognosis independent of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is currently the best method to detect SWMA and to assess fibrosis.To quantify fibrosis by using late gadolinium enhancement CMR in patients with Chagas disease and preserved or minimally impaired ventricular function (> 45%), and to detect patterns of dependence between fibrosis, SWMA and LVEF in the presence of ventricular arrhythmia.Electrocardiogram, treadmill exercise test, Holter and CMR were carried out in 61 patients, who were divided into three groups as follows: (1) normal electrocardiogram and CMR without SWMA; (2) abnormal electrocardiogram and CMR without SWMA; (3) CMR with SWMA independently of electrocardiogram.The number of patients with ventricular arrhythmia in relation to the total of patients, the percentage of fibrosis, and the LVEF were, respectively: Group 1, 4/26, 0.74% and 74.34%; Group 2, 4/16, 3.96% and 68.5%; and Group 3, 11/19, 14.07% and 55.59%. Ventricular arrhythmia was found in 31.1% of the patients. Those with and without ventricular arrhythmia had mean LVEF of 59.87% and 70.18%, respectively, and fibrosis percentage of 11.03% and 3.01%, respectively. Of the variables SWMA, groups, age, LVEF and fibrosis, only the latter was significant for the presence of ventricular arrhythmia, with a cutoff point of 11.78% for fibrosis mass (p < 0.001).Even in patients with Chagas disease and preserved or minimally impaired ventricular function, electrical instability can be present. Regarding the presence of ventricular arrhythmia, fibrosis is the most important variable, its amount being proportional to the complexity of the groups.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918912","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.828557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.761521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.751478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.714032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Holter monitor","weight":0.701021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holter_monitor"},{"name":"Cardiac stress test","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_stress_test"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.397274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"1119","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1119"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Pattern recognition (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 426","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_426"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Treadmill","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill"}]}
