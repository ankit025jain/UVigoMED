{"id":53689,"title":"Paclitaxel-eluting balloon vs. standard angioplasty to reduce recurrent restenosis in diabetic patients with in-stent restenosis of the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries: the DEBATE-ISR study.","abstract":"To test the ability of a drug-eluting balloon (DEB) to reduce recurrent in-stent restenosis (ISR) in diabetic patients with femoropopliteal stents.No significant differences in terms of clinical, angiographic, or procedural characteristics were observed between the study groups. Lesion length was 132±86 mm in the DEB group vs. 137±82 mm in the BA group. Procedural success, defined as a residual stenosis <30% in the restenotic segment (stent +5 mm at proximal and distal edges), was obtained in all treated lesions. At 1-year follow-up, 6 patients died (3 in each group), and 1 patient in the BA group underwent major amputation. Recurrent restenosis, assessed by angiography (66%) or ultrasound (34%), occurred in 8/41 (19.5%) patients in the DEB group vs. 28/39 (71.8%) in the BA group (p<0.001). Target lesion revascularization for symptomatic recurrent restenosis was performed in 6/44 (13.6%) patients in the DEB vs.13/42 (31.0%) in the BA group (p=0.045).Using DEB for treating femoropopliteal ISR led to a significant reduction in recurrent restenosis and repeat angioplasty at 1-year follow-up as compared to historical controls.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502477","annotations":[{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.733699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.691428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.615269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Restenosis","weight":0.373267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restenosis"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0401725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Procedural programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming"},{"name":"841","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/841"},{"name":"644","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/644"},{"name":"1342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1342"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Deb (file format)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)"},{"name":"Target Corporation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Popliteal artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_artery"}]}
