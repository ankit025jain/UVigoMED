{"id":50390,"title":"A novel cell-based assay for measuring neutralizing autoantibodies against type I interferons in patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1.","abstract":"An important characteristic of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS 1) is the existence of neutralizing autoantibodies (nAbs) against the type I interferons (IFN) -?2 and -? at frequencies close to 100%. Type 1 IFN autoantibodies are detected by antiviral neutralizing assays (AVA), binding assays with radiolabelled antigens (RLBA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or by reporter-based cell assays. We here present a simple and reliable version of the latter utilizing a commercially available cell line (HEK-Blue IFN-?/?). All 67 APS 1 patients were positive for IFN-? nAbs, while 90% were positive for IFN-?2 nAbs, a 100% and 96% correlation with RLBA, respectively. All blood donors and non-APS 1 patients were negative. The dilution titer required to reduce the effect of IFN-? nAbs correlated with the RLBA index. This cell-based autoantibody assay (CBAA) is easy to perform, suitable for high throughput, while providing high specificity and sensitivity.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792136","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.751436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.73549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.478101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.172202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.140191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"High-throughput screening","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_polyendocrine_syndrome"},{"name":"Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_polyendocrine_syndrome_type_1"},{"name":"Interferon type I","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Throughput","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"American Physical Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society"},{"name":"Typecasting (acting)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting_(acting)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Community Broadcasting Association of Australia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Broadcasting_Association_of_Australia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"}]}
