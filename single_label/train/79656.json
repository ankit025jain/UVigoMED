{"id":79656,"title":"[Prevalence of malaria in Liaoning Province, 2008 to 2013].","abstract":"To understand the trend and epidemiologic characteristics of malaria prevalence so as to provide the evidence for further control of the disease in Liaoning Province.The data of registered cases of malaria in Liaoning Province from 2008 to 2013 were collected and analyzed with the descriptive epidemiological methods.A total of 202 malaria cases were reported from 2008 to 2013. There was no epidemic outbreak, and the average annual incidence was 0.08/ 100,000. Totally 17 P. v. cases of local infection were reported, and 185 imported malaria cases were reported (P.v. 33 cases, P.f 113 cases, P.v. & Pf. 13 cases, P.o. 3 cases, and unspecified 23 cases). The ratio of male to female was 5.91:1, the populations aged 31-45 years were the most (47.52%), and the main occupation was exported labors (46.04%). The 179 imported cases were infected in Africa and Southeast Asia, 6 imported cases were infected in Anhui Province, Yunnan Province and Hongkong, and 16 local cases were infected in the border area of Dandong City.Although the annual incidence of malaria in Liaoning Province is lower than 1/10,000, the incidence shows an increasing trend because the exported labors are increased. Therefore, the epidemic monitoring and health education should be strengthened, especially for the exported labors who have returned.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051840","annotations":[{"name":"Yunnan","weight":0.811974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.765787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.754165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.594954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.488427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.407348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Liaoning","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning"},{"name":"Anhui","weight":0.129541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Trans woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Dandong","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandong"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Epidemiological method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological_method"},{"name":"Pfennig","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfennig"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Provinces of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"}]}
