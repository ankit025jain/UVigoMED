{"id":23683,"title":"Efficacy of pre-operative nasal staphylococcus aureus screening and chlorhexidine chest scrub in decreasing the incidence of post-resection empyema.","abstract":"We evaluated the efficacy of pre-operative Staphylococcus aureus (SA) screening and chlorhexidine chest scrub in decreasing the incidence of empyema after major pulmonary resections.For two years, a strategy aimed at decreasing post-resection empyema was instituted. This entailed pre-operative screening for nasal SA and chlorhexidine chest scrub the night before surgery (Group Swab-Scrub, n=192). Patients screened positive for SA, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive (MSSA), received 5 d of nasal mupirocin. Group Swab-Scrub was compared with patients two years earlier, who did not receive this pre-operative maneuver (Group Control, n=173). The extent of resection considered was lobectomy or greater. All patients received cefazolin (or clindamycin if allergic) prior to incision and 24?h postoperatively, except for patient in Group Swab-Scrub screening positive for MRSA, who received vancomycin. All patients had povidone-iodine skin preparation.In Group Swab-Scrub, prevalence of nasal SA was 8.9% (17/192) two with MRSA and 15 with MSSA. There was no difference in patient demographics or operative characteristics between the Group Swab-Scrub and Group Control. There was also no difference in prolonged air-leak, empyema, wound infection, pneumonia, or mortality rates between the two groups. When stratifying for the extent of procedure, there was no difference in the incidence of empyema after lobectomy (Group Swab-Scrub, 3.9% [7/177] versus Group Control, 2.0% [3/151]; p=0.352) or pneumonectomy (Group Swab-Scrub, 6.7% [1/15] versus Group Control, 13.6% [3/22]; p=0.633). In both univariate and multivariable analysis, prolonged air-leak and pneumonectomy were significant risk factors for empyema.Preoperative screening for nasal SA and chlorhexidine chest scrub does not seem to decrease empyema rates after major pulmonary resection. Prolonged air-leak and pneumonectomy continue to be significant risk factors for developing empyema. The number of patients undergoing pneumonectomy in this study is small and further studies are needed for this patient population.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476018","annotations":[{"name":"Mupirocin","weight":0.921372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mupirocin"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Clindamycin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clindamycin"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.537794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pneumonectomy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonectomy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Empyema","weight":0.249688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyema"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.196415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0884832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Cefazolin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefazolin"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
