{"id":36731,"title":"[A patient with Noonan syndrome].","abstract":"Noonan syndrome is a relatively common autosomal dominant genetic disorder which is characterised by typical facial features, congenital heart diseases and small stature. In 50% of the cases the syndrome is caused by a mutation on the PTPN11-gen. The expression of symptoms associated with Noonan syndrome can be very mild in nature and facial features usually become less pronounced with age, which can sometimes make a correct diagnosis more difficult. Despite a wide range of associated symptoms most adults with Noonan syndrome can be self-sustaining, with a good quality of life. It is important that the dentist is well-informed about this syndrome due to the heart diseases and bleeding disorders which can be present with these patients and may influence a dentist's choice of therapy when invasive treatment is indicated.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555250","annotations":[{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.819649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.659673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.6387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Noonan syndrome","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noonan_syndrome"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.25977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.144071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"PTPN11","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPN11"},{"name":"Genitive case","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"}]}
