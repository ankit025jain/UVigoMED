{"id":43020,"title":"Ischemic reperfusion injury-induced oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory mediators in liver transplantation recipients.","abstract":"Liver ischemic reperfusion injury is harmful to transplant recipients, and is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Our study was designed to investigate the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory mediators in liver transplant recipients.We prospectively analyzed 14 recipients who underwent liver transplantation by measuring their blood levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and IL-6, at nine time points perioperatively. We also evaluated the correlations between oxidative stress (MDA levels) and the characteristics of the recipient or the donated graft.These parameters significantly increased from 1 minute before reperfusion, and the values peaked within 3 to 30 minutes after reperfusion. On the time point at 5 minutes after reperfusion, the MDA levels which were the highest in the recipients correlated with the values of preoperative direct/and total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, international normalized ratio (INR), and surgical blood loss.The levels of MDA, TNF-?, IL-1?, and IL-6 greatly increased with the ischemic reperfusion insult. Recipients with higher values of preoperative direct/and total bilirubin, AST, ALT, MELD score, INR, and surgical blood loss tended to have higher levels of MDA and may suffer more injury from this insult.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815134","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.875328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.815716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.680356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.521772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.466591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.386315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.293668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.279407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"}]}
