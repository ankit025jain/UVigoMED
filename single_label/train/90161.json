{"id":90161,"title":"An evaluation of KerraMax Care in the management of moderate to heavily exuding wounds.","abstract":"Highly exuding wounds are common and can result in malodour, pain, maceration, infection and unsightly soiled dressings, as well as having a negative impact on an individual's quality of life. This communication reports on the findings from an evaluation by nurses regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of superabsorbent dressing KerraMax Care and the patient experience of KerraMax Care in the management of moderate to highly exuding wounds. A total of 54 evaluations were completed. Nurses commented on the main benefits seen clinically with KerraMax Care as being reduced maceration, exudate managed and improved wound appearance. Other changes observed in wound appearance noted were visible granulation tissue and reduced pain. The evaluation demonstrates the positive impact that good dressing selection can have on the lives of patients, improving their wound-care experience and outcome.
