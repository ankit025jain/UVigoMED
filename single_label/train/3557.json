{"id":3557,"title":"Screening of the miRNAs related to breast cancer and identification of its target genes.","abstract":"To predict and verify the target genes of the miRNAs related to breast cancer beginning from the miRNA expression profile of human breast cancer.The total RNA was extracted from cancer tissues and the corresponding paracancerous tissues of eight breast cancer patients, and then miRNAs were separated. Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and the normal mammary epithelial cell line HBL-100 were cultured, and the total RNA was extracted, respectively, with separation of miRNAs. The gene chip technology was used to analyze and detect the miRNAs differentially expressed in tissues and cancer cells. The miRNA expression profile of human breast cancer was obtained through chip scanning and data analysis.Through dual-luciferase method, it was verified that PDCD4 and PDCD10 were real target genes of miR-21 and miR-200c, respectively.miR-21 and miR-200c are related miRNAs to breast cancer, and they are associated with the occurrence and development of breast cancer.","date":"2015-01-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566594","annotations":[{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.762223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.547482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.452922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.414229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.361358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.3546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.270166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"PDCD10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCD10"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"}]}
