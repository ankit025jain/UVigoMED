{"id":78568,"title":"The importance of electrically evoked stapedial reflex in cochlear implant.","abstract":"The most important stage in fitting a cochlear implant is the identification of its dynamic range. The use of objective measures, in particular the electrically elicited stapedius reflex, may provide suitable assistence for initial fitting of cochlear implant, especially in children or adult with multiple disorders, because they provide specific values that serve as the basis of early cochlear implant programming.Verify through a review the use of the electrically elicited stapedius reflex threshold during the activation and mapping process of cochlear implant.Bibliographical search on the Pubmed and Bireme plataforms, and also on Medline, LILACS and SciELO databases, with standard searches until September 2012, using specific keywords. For the selection and evaluation of scientific studies found in the search, criterias have been established, considering the following aspects: author, year/location, grade of recommendation/level of evidence, purpose, sample, age, mean age in years, evaluative testing, results and conclusion.Among 7,304 articles found, 7,080 were excluded from the title, 152 from the abstract, 17 from the article reading, 43 were repeated and 12 were selected for the study.The electrically elicited stapedius reflex may support when programming the cochlear implant, especially in patients with inconsistent responses.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626895","annotations":[{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Bireme","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bireme"},{"name":"Acoustic reflex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex"},{"name":"Stapedius muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapedius_muscle"},{"name":"SciELO","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciELO"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"304","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/304"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Keywords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Dynamic range","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
