{"id":73212,"title":"[Physician and medical psychologist: complementary approaches in providing psychological care to cancer patient].","abstract":"In providing psychological care to an oncological patient a physician and a medical psychologist come from a variety of professional positions that require different approaches and methods. It is proposed a three-phase model of the dynamics of the psychological state of the person in the situation of cancer reflecting the process of psychological adaptation of a particular patient. Focusing on this model, the authors conclude that psychological care to cancer patient, performed by a doctor and a medical psychologist, are different kinds of psychological care that does not replace but complement each other.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919270","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.549488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.429685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.363138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychologist","weight":0.186848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Psychological adaptation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_adaptation"},{"name":"Medical psychology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_psychology"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Focusing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.0151828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"}]}
