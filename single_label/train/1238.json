{"id":1238,"title":"Bioelectrical impedance analyzes offers clinically relevant appraisal of body composition, but fails to recognize nutritional risk or differences between surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions treatments--a non-randomized cohort.","abstract":"Our aim was to evaluate the adipose tissue percentage content appraised with BIA in patients recently treated for cardiovascular disorders by means of surgery or percutaneous coronary interventions. Study included 208 consecutive patients, in age range 25-84 years, 176 male and 32 female. There were 108 (51.9%) percutaneous coronary interventions and 100 (48.1%) operations. Adipose tissue share appraised by BIA in our settings was 28.6-6.7% with significant differences in relation with gender (p<0.001) and no relations with the age of patients. Intermediate levels of correlations were found in relation to the body mass index (Rho: 0.521, p<0.001), waist-circumference (Rho: 0.450; p<0.001) and hip-circumference (Rho: 0.393; p<0.001). ROC-analyzes revealed diagnostic cutoff point of BIA at 29.5% for predicting the obesity (AUC=0.761; p<0.001) and 27% for metabolic syndrome (AUC=0.715; p<0.001). There were no relations of BIA to nutritional status, laboratory or echocardiography diagnostic. BIA offered clinically relevant appraisal of anthropometrically and metabolic related risks from cardiovascular continuum. Diagnostic yields solely on impedance analyze bases seem limited, particularly in investigational settings with composited endpoints.","date":"2014-11-25","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420383","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.805861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.805736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.499516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.397303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.394432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.336816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.322201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.303847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"761","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/761"},{"name":"393","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/393"},{"name":"208","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/208"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Real estate appraisal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Compositing","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Bioelectromagnetism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectromagnetism"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Continuum (theory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)"}]}
