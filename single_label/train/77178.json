{"id":77178,"title":"Using population reach as a proxy metric for intervention impact to prioritize selection of obesity prevention strategies in Los Angeles County, 2010-2012.","abstract":"Recent federal initiatives have used estimates of population reach as a proxy metric for intervention impact, in part to inform resource allocation and programmatic decisions about competing priorities in the community. However, in spite of its utility, population reach as a singular metric of intervention impact may be insufficient for guiding multifaceted program decisions. A more comprehensive, validated approach to measure or forecast dose may complement reach estimates to inform decision makers about optimal ways to use limited resources.
