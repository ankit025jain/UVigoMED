{"id":92721,"title":"Temporal artery biopsy size does not matter.","abstract":"This study aimed to clarify whether positive temporal artery biopsies had a greater sample length than negative biopsies in temporal arteritis. It has been suggested that biopsy length should be at least 1 cm to improve diagnostic accuracy. A retrospective review of 149 patients who had 151 temporal artery biopsies was conducted. Twenty biopsies were positive (13.3%), 124 negative (82.1%) and seven samples were insufficient (4.6%). There was no clinically significant difference in the mean biopsy size between positive (0.7 cm) and negative samples (0.65 cm) (t-test: p =?.43 NS). Ninety-four patients fulfilled all three ACR criteria prior to biopsy (62.3%) and four patients (2.6%) changed ACR score from 2 to 3 after biopsy. Treatment should not be delayed in anticipation of the biopsy or withheld in the case of a negative biopsy if the patient's symptoms improve.","date":"2014-11-12","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24347135","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.295649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.154457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Giant cell arteritis","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell_arteritis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Superficial temporal artery","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superficial_temporal_artery"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"American College of Rheumatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Rheumatology"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Arteritis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteritis"},{"name":"ACR score for rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACR_score_for_rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
