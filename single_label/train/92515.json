{"id":92515,"title":"MicroRNA let-7i induced autophagy to protect T cell from apoptosis by targeting IGF1R.","abstract":"MicroRNA let-7i is up-regulated in T cells from patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). In this study, we investigated the role of let-7i in T cells survival. Our results demonstrated down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) in T cells from patients with AS. Luciferase reporter assay suggested IGF1R as direct target of let-7i. Overexpression of let-7i in Jurkat cells significantly suppressed IGF1R expression, which mimicked the action of IGF1R siRNA. IGF1R inhibition led to a strinking decrease in phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt, down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax and cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. Meanwhile, IGF1R inhibition induced autophagy. Autophagy induced by let-7i overexpression contributed to protect cells from apoptosis. Our data indicated that let-7i might control T cells fates in AS by targeting IGF1R.","date":"2015-01-29","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25305490","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.82342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor","weight":0.776142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1_receptor"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Ankylosing spondylitis","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.696422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.453399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.445403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Caspase 3","weight":0.380273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_3"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.118728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Spondylitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylitis"},{"name":"Jurkat cells","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurkat_cells"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
