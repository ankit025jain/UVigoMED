{"id":32321,"title":"Osteogensis imperfecta and role of nurse in management.","abstract":"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare but striking cause of bone fragility and fractures. It usually presents in children or young adults. Consider it in the differential diagnosis when a child presents with a history of recurrent fractures. Early detection can improve morbidity. Nurses, if have the knowledge of the disease, can protect the child in hospital and can educate parents appropriately how to take care the child.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974528","annotations":[{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.634577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.561903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.450483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.363382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Strike action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Oi (telecommunications)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oi_(telecommunications)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
