{"id":45257,"title":"Curcumin suppresses vasculogenic mimicry capacity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells through STAT3 and PI3K/AKT inhibition.","abstract":"Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the process in which highly invasive cancer cells mimic endothelial cells by forming blood channels. In the present study, we investigated the effect of curcumin, a natural product from turmeric, on VM of SK-Hep-1 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.In vitro VM, cell migration, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) production of HCC cells were determined by Matrigel tube formation assay, Transwell cell migration assay, and gelatin zymography, respectively. Effects of curcumin on AKT, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) signaling pathways were determined by immunoblot analysis.At non-cytotoxic concentrations, curcumin inhibited VM, reduced cell migration and MMP9 production of the HCC cells. Further study revealed that the anti-VM effect of curcumin was due to inhibition of AKT and STAT3 phosphorylation, as confirmed by specific inhibitors.Curcumin presents proven potential as an anti-VM agent in HCC cells, through down-regulation of STAT3 and AKT signaling pathways.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692720","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.897423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.83357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.802553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.7269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.703722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.561076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.532844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.502411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Curcumin","weight":0.11419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Turmeric","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0236065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"}]}
