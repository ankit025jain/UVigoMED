{"id":81016,"title":"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for treatment of sustained ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas' heart disease: comparison with a control group treated with amiodarone alone.","abstract":"Evidence is inconclusive concerning the benefit of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for secondary prevention of mortality in patients with Chagas' heart disease (ChHD). The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of ChHD patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), who were treated either with ICD implantation plus amiodarone or with amiodarone alone.The ICD group [76 patients; 48 men; age, 57 ± 11 years; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 39 ± 12%] and the historical control group treated with amiodarone alone (28 patients; 18 men; age, 54 ± 10 years; LVEF, 41 ± 10%) had comparable baseline characteristics, except for a higher use of beta-blockers in the ICD group (P < 0.0001). Amiodarone was also used in 90% of the ICD group. Therapy with ICD plus amiodarone resulted in a 72% reduced risk of all-cause mortality (P = 0.007) and a 95% reduced risk of sudden death (P = 0.006) compared with amiodarone-only therapy. The survival benefit of ICD was greatest in patients with LVEF < 40% (P = 0.01) and was not significant in those with LVEF ? 40% (P = 0.15). Appropriate ICD therapies occurred in 72% of patients and the rates of interventions were similar across patients with LVEF < 40% and ?40%.Compared with amiodarone-only therapy, ICD implantation plus amiodarone reduced the risk of all-cause mortality and sudden death in ChHD patients with life-threatening VAs. Patients with LVEF < 40% derived significantly more survival benefit from ICD therapy. The majority of ICD-treated patients received appropriate therapies regardless of the LV systolic function.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481778","annotations":[{"name":"Amiodarone","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiodarone"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.655014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.575313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.40656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
