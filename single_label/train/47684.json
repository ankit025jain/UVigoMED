{"id":47684,"title":"A microRNA-operated switch of asymmetric-to-symmetric cancer stem cell divisions.","abstract":"Defective asymmetric cell divisions of stem and progenitor cells are associated with tumorigenesis by a largely unknown mechanism. A signalling axis involving Snail, microRNA-146a and Numb is now shown to regulate the switch between symmetric and asymmetric cell division in colorectal cancer stem cells.
