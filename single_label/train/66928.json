{"id":66928,"title":"Discovery of Apo-A1 as a potential bladder cancer biomarker by urine proteomics and analysis.","abstract":"Bladder cancer is clinically characterized by high recurrent rate and poor prognosis and thereby patients need regular re-examinations which are invasive, unpleasant, and expensive. A noninvasive and less expensive method for detecting and monitoring bladder cancer would thus be advantageous. In this study, by using the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) approach with subsequent mass spectrometry (MS), we demonstrated the increased expression of apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1) in individual urine from patients with bladder cancer, which was confirmed by Western blot results. A further analysis of the urinary Apo-A1 levels by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay yielded results that were consistent with the Western blot, and suggested Apo-A1 could provide diagnostic utility to distinguish patients with bladder cancer from healthy controls at 19.21 ng/ml. Further validation assay in a larger number of urine samples (n=379) showed that Apo-A1 could be used as a biomarker to diagnosis bladder cancer with a sensitivity and specificity of 89.2% and 84.6% respectively. Moreover, the application of exfoliative urinary cytology in combination with the urine Apo-A1 detection could significantly increased the sensitivity in detecting bladder cancer. Our data showed a significant relationship of expressed Apo-A1 was established between bladder cancer and normal controls. Apo-A1 could be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of bladder cancer.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661883","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.892598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.868908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.572973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.538707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.493634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.482669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0918031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0458912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
