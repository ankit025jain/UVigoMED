{"id":79726,"title":"School-based control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis in western Visayas, Philippines.","abstract":"We evaluated the effect of a local government unit-led, school-based, teacher-assisted mass drug administration (MDA) treatment of soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) on the morbidity of school children in selected provinces of western Visayas, the Philippines. Parasitological assessment was done on stool samples using the Kato-Katz technique. Nutritional status and school performance were also evaluated using secondary data from the Department of Education. The overall prevalence of STH decreased from 71.1% to 44.3% (p < 0.0001) and the prevalence of heavy infection with STH decreased from 40.5% to 14.5% (p < 0.0001), after two years of biannual MDA. The prevalence of underweight children decreased from 26.2% to 17.8% (p < 0.0001) and the prevalence of stunted children decreased from 20.9% to 16.6% (p < 0.0001) after two years of biannual MDA. School performance improved on standardized testing from a mean percentage of 53.8% to 64.6%. Advocacy, social mobilization, strong local government support and intersectoral collaboration with other agencies probably contributed to the success of the program.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974639","annotations":[{"name":"Philippines","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"},{"name":"School","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.466486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.18939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.168905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Local government","weight":0.15486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Advocacy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"United States Department of Education","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education"},{"name":"Visayas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visayas"},{"name":"Helminthiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthiasis"},{"name":"Mass drug administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_drug_administration"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Stunting (broadcasting)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunting_(broadcasting)"},{"name":"Secondary data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_data"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Biannual","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biannual"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Mass mobilization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_mobilization"},{"name":"Administration (government)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_(government)"}]}
