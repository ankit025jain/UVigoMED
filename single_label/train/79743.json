We compared the sensitivities of the miracidium hatching test (MHT) with the modified Kato-Katz method (KK) and the combination of the two methods (KK-MHT) to detect Sj infection in low prevalence areas of China. The stool samples of 3,853 residents from 8 villages with a light to moderate prevalence (0-23%) of Sj infection were examined by KK, MHT and KK-MHT. The findings were inconsistent. The KK-MHT conbination gave more positives than either the KK or MHT alone. Using the KK-MHT, we determined the missed rates with the KK (mR(K)) and MHT (mR(H)) to be 30.1% and 10.2%, respectively. At light prevalence sites (infection rate < 10%) the mR(K) was 60.6%, significantly higher than the mR(K) of 22.3% found at moderate prevalence sites (10-23%). However, the mR(H) at the light and moderate prevalence sites were 11.54% and 9.90%, respectively (p > 0.05). The combination KK-MHT had the best sensitivity in low Sj prevalence areas in China and the KK method alone was the least sensitive. Using KK alone as a screening method will result in an underestimation of Sj infection disease burden.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964649","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"China","weight":0.763952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"People's Republic of China","weight":0.543566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.542338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.458909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.305818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.277943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Trematode lifecycle stages","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematode_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"853","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/853"},{"name":"1023","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1023"},{"name":"MHTML","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"KK (singer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KK_(singer)"},{"name":"Methods of detecting extrasolar planets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar_planets"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"}]}
