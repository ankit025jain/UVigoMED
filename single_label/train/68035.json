{"id":68035,"title":"Semen quality in middle-aged males: associations with prostate-specific antigen and age-related prostate conditions.","abstract":"To compare markers of semen quality and related reproductive indicators in middle-aged males in relation to serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.A total of 384 voluntary middle-aged men who underwent screening for prostate health were recruited. Reproductive function, semen quality, hormonal parameters, prostate-related pathologies, and PSA levels were measured.Total sperm count and sperm concentration were decreased in men with elevated serum PSA compared with age-matched controls. Serum FSH levels differed significantly in subjects with non-malignant, pre-malignant, and malignant prostate conditions. PSA levels in men with three normal semen variables (semen volume ? 1.5 mL, sperm density ? 15 Ã— 10(6)/mL, and A + B motility ? 40%) were significantly lower compared with subjects with altered parameters (1.51 ng/ml vs. 2.47 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.002). PSA showed a negative correlation with semen volume and total sperm count, and a positive correlation with semen interleukin-6.Our data demonstrate that serum PSA levels are related to impaired reproductive parameters in middle-aged subjects. While there is no consensus about the potential link between male factor infertility, impaired reproductive indicators, and prostate pathologies, this topic needs additional research focusing on the interactions between male aging, reproductive function, and the prostate.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564432","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.609909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.453623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Semen quality","weight":0.356375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_quality"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.299697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.278001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.213957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.15817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
