{"id":15013,"title":"Comparative analysis of apoptotic changes in peripheral immune organs and lungs following experimental infection of piglets with highly pathogenic and classical porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.","abstract":"Our previous studies have demonstrated that piglets infected with highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) may develop significant thymus atrophy, which related to thymocytes apoptosis. However, apart from that detected in the thymus, there are no reports describing cell apoptosis induced by HP-PRRSV infection. In this study, we analyzed comparatively the pathological changes, cell apoptosis and viral load in peripheral immune organs including tonsil, inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) and spleen and lungs following experimental infection of piglets with HP-PRRSV HuN4 and classical PRRSV CH-1a.HP-PRRSV HuN4 exhibited much stronger cell tropism than CH-1a in immune organs and lungs of piglets. HuN4 infection led to the serious injuries in tonsils, ILNs, spleens and lungs, especially apoptosis in these organs was significant.HuN4 infection induced severe lesions (gross pathology, histopathology and cell apoptosis) in the peripheral immune organs and lungs of infected piglets. Large numbers of apoptotic cells in immune organs and lung induced by HuN4 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the HP-PRRS and the distinct injuries caused by HuN4 infection may be associated with the high mortality rate of HP-PRRS in pigs.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24393149","annotations":[{"name":"Tonsil","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsil"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.748578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.725994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.694388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Tropism","weight":0.569436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropism"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.522564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.438504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Thymocyte","weight":0.423418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymocyte"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Gross anatomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_anatomy"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"}]}
