{"id":36940,"title":"High long-term symptomatic recurrence rates after Chiari-1 decompression without dural opening: a single center experience.","abstract":"We evaluated long-term outcomes of posterior fossa decompression (PFD) without duroplasty in consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Chiari-1 malformation.We searched the institutional database for all adult patients who underwent Chiari decompression between 1995 and 2007. PFD was offered to all consecutive patients with Chairi-1 malformation during this time period. We excluded patients who underwent re-exploration after initial Chiari-1 decompression elsewhere. Besides the demographic variables, presenting symptoms, neurological and radiographic findings the clinical records were studied for long-term outcomes specifically symptomatic improvement. We defined symptomatic improvement as resolution of all presenting symptoms including pain and/or neurological deficits at the last follow-up. The factors associated with symptom recurrence were also analyzed.We identified 47 patients who underwent PFD for Chiari-1 malformation. Syringomyelia was noted in 36.2% of patients and the mean tonsilar herniation was 12.6mm. At a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, the symptomatic improvement rate was 60.6%. There were no operative complications. Repeat posterior fossa decompression was required for 31.9% patients with symptomatic recurrence at an average of 2.6 years after initial decompression. Fibrotic thickening overlying the dura mater was observed in one-third of these patients.This case series reports low complication but high long-term symptomatic recurrence rates adults with symptomatic Chiari-1 malformation undergoing PFD.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529230","annotations":[{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Dura mater","weight":0.632117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.31732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.215424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syringomyelia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringomyelia"},{"name":"Posterior cranial fossa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cranial_fossa"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Thickening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Personal flotation device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Chiari","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiari"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"}]}
