{"id":51506,"title":"H-RAS mutations are restricted to sporadic pheochromocytomas lacking specific clinical or pathological features: data from a multi-institutional series.","abstract":"Somatic or germline mutations in up to 15 disease-causative genes are detectable in up to 50% of patients with pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL). Very recently, somatic H-RAS mutations were identified by exome sequencing in approximately 7% in sporadic PCCs and PGLs, in association with male sex and benign behavior.To explore the prevalence of RAS mutations in a cohort of 271 PCC and PGL from a European registry and to compare the genotype with clinical and pathological characteristics of potential clinical interest.Genetic screening for hotspot mutations in H-, N-, and K-RAS genes was performed by means of Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing methods on tumor DNA in a series of patients with (n = 107) or without (n = 164) germline or somatic PCC/PGL-related gene mutations.Overall, H-RAS mutations were detected in 5.2% of cases (14/271), which were confined to sporadic PCCs resulting in a prevalence of 10% (14/140) in this cohort. In contrast, no mutations were found in PCC with PCC/PGL-related gene mutations (0/76) or in PGL (0/55) harboring or not mutations in PCC/PGL susceptibility genes. In this large series, H-RAS mutations in PCCs lacked any significant correlation with pathological or basic clinical endpoints.Somatic H-RAS mutations are restricted to a relevant proportion of sporadic PCC. These findings provide the basis to study potential H-RAS-dependent correlations with long-term outcome data.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684458","annotations":[{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.912877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.845212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.748544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.746831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Paraganglioma","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraganglioma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.276462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.0862776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"HRAS","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HRAS"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"}]}
