{"id":84860,"title":"[Clinical evaluation study on long-term effect of acupuncture with pattern/syndrome differentiation on functional dyspepsia].","abstract":"To compare the efficacy difference in the treatment of functional dyspepsia between acupuncture at the acupoints selected by pattern/syndrome differentiation and domperidone.Seventy cases were randomized into an acupuncture group (35 cases) and a western medication group (35 cases). In the acupuncture group, Zusanli (ST 36) and Neiguan (PC 6) were selected. Taichong (LR 3) and Neiting (ST 44) were added for excess syndrome while Gongsun (SP 4) and Yinlingquan (SP 9) were added for deficiency syndrome. A pair of electrodes was attached to one acupoint and an assistant point (2 mm next to the acupoint centripetally) and stimulated with disperse-dense wave at 2 Hz/100 Hz, once a day. In the western medication group, domperidone was prescribed for oral administration, 10 mg each time, three times a day. In the two groups, the treatment of 5 days made one session and 4 sessions were required totally. Nepean dyspepsia index (NDI) was compared after treatment, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 months after treatment between the two groups respectively.The score of symptom and score of life quality in NDI after treatment and at each follow-up time point were improved obviously in the acupuncture group as compared with those before treatment (all P < 0.01). In the western mediation group, the score of symptom and the score of life quality in NDI after treatment and in follow-up of 1, 2 and 3 months were improved obviously as compared with those before treatment (all P < 0.01), but the differences were not significant in follow-up of 4 and 5 months (both P > 0.05). Compared with the western medication group, the symptom score of NDI was reduced obviously after treatment and in each time point of follow-up in the acupuncture group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), and the score of life quality was increased obviously (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).Acupuncture at the acupoints selected by pattern/syndrome differentiation and domperidone are effective in the treatment of functional dyspepsia. Domperidone is unsatisfactory in the long-term effect, but acupuncture achieves the positive short-term and long-term effects on functional dyspepsia.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022109","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.709591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.408251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.3699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.316757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.20626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.200392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Domperidone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domperidone"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Centripetal force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Nepean, Ontario","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepean,_Ontario"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
