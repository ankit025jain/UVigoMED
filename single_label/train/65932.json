{"id":65932,"title":"Counts of Slackia sp. strain NATTS in intestinal flora are correlated to serum concentrations of equol both in prostate cancer cases and controls in Japanese men.","abstract":"Isoflavones, which are included in soybeans, have been suggested to protect against prostate cancer. Equol, one of isoflavones, is an intestinally derived bacterial metabolite of daidzein. A newly identified equol-producing bacterium, Slackia sp. strain NATTS, with a high equol-producing activity was isolated from human feces in Japanese adults. Counts of Slackia sp. strain NATTS in intestinal flora have not been assessed with regard to prostate cancer risk. In this study, we investigated the association of serum isoflavones and counts of Slackia sp. strain NATTS with prostate cancer risk in a case-control study.Concentrations of isoflavones and counts of Slackia sp. strain NATTS in feces were measured from 44 patients with prostate cancer and 28 hospital controls. The risk of prostate cancer was evaluated in terms of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by the logistic regression analysis.The detection proportions of Slackia sp. strain NATTS in cases and controls were 34.1% and 25.0%, respectively. Counts of Slackia sp. strain NATTS were significantly correlated with serum concentrations of equol both in cases and controls (Spearman correlation coefficients, rs=0.639 and rs=0.572, p<0.01, respectively). Serum concentrations of genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and equol were not significantly associated with risk of prostate cancer.This study found that counts of Slackia sp. strain NATTS correlated with serum concentrations of equol both in prostate cancer cases and controls, but serum isoflavone concentrations were not associated with risk of prostate cancer in our patients.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761887","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.763088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.547712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.494368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.411195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.403001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.364358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0906061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Isoflavones","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflavones"},{"name":"Genistein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genistein"},{"name":"Daidzein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daidzein"},{"name":"Soybean","weight":0.0269276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0197861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.0172936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"}]}
