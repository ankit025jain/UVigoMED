{"id":89676,"title":"[Successful laparoscopic repair of delayed traumatic abdominal wall hernia].","abstract":"The occurrence of traumatic abdominal wall hernia secondary to blunt trauma is uncommon, and laparoscopic repair of such hernias is very rare. A 53-year-old man, who had sustained injuries to his right thigh and right abdomen 8 months previously, visited a hospital because of a bulge in the right lateral abdomen. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a rupture in the lateral abdominal muscle and herniation of the cecum into the subcutaneous space. Accordingly, delayed traumatic abdominal wall hernia was diagnosed, which was successfully repaired laparoscopically. Thus, a laparoscopic tension-free mesh repair was safely and effectively performed for delayed traumatic abdominal wall hernia.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693691","annotations":[{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.847851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.775896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.399803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"}]}
