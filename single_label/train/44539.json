{"id":44539,"title":"Benzyl isothiocyanate suppresses high-fat diet-stimulated mammary tumor progression via the alteration of tumor microenvironments in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice.","abstract":"We previously reported that a high-fat diet (HFD) and M2-macrophages induce changes in tumor microenvironments and stimulate tumor growth and metastasis of 4T1 mammary cancer cells in BALB/c mice. In this study, we attempted to determine whether benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) inhibits HFD-induced changes in tumor progression and in tumor microenvironments. Four groups of female BALB/c mice (4-week-old) were fed on a control diet (CD, 10?kcal% fat) and HFD (60?kcal% fat) containing BITC (0, 25, or 100?mg/kg diet) for 20 weeks. Following 16 weeks of feeding, 4T1 cells (5Ã—10(4) cells) were injected into the mammary fat pads, and animals were killed 30 d after the injection. HFD feeding increased solid tumor growth and the number of tumor nodules in the lung and liver, as compared to the CD group, and these increases were inhibited by BITC supplementation. The number of lipid vacuoles, CD45+ leukocytes and CD206+ M2-macrophages, expression of Ki67, levels of cytokines/chemokines, including macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and mRNA levels of F4/80, CD86, Ym1, CD163, CCR2, and M-CSF receptor were increased in the tumor tissues of HFD-fed mice, and these increases were inhibited by BITC supplementation. In vitro culture results demonstrated that BITC inhibited macrophage migration as well as lipid droplet accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. These results suggest that suppression of lipid accumulation and macrophage infiltration in tumor tissues may be one of the mechanisms by which BITC suppresses tumor progression in HFD-fed mice.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Digestive System
