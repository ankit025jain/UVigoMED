{"id":53348,"title":"[Orthopaedic neurological diseases in patient with diabetes].","abstract":"Individuals with diabetes are at a greater risk for microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, than are individuals without diabetes. Diabetic neuropathies are complex heterogeneous disorders that include both focal neuropathies and diffuse polyneuropathy. Entrapment neuropathy is an example of a focal neuropathy, while distal symmetric polyneuropathy is the most common type of diffuse polyneuropathy. Entrapment neuropathies are highly prevalent in the diabetic population, but they develop insidiously and progressively, making it difficult to determine their true prevalence. Entrapment neuropathies are suspected to be a more common complication of diabetes than is polyneuropathy. For example, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)-one of the most common entrapment neuropathies encountered in patients with diabetes-results from median nerve compression, and has been shown to occur three times more frequently in a diabetic population than in a normal healthy population. Entrapment neuropathies should be actively screened for in patients showing the signs and symptoms of neuropathy, because such patients may require surgical treatment.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523313","annotations":[{"name":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.769734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.645925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.520925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.390812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.323247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Median nerve","weight":0.0645239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve"},{"name":"Nerve compression syndrome","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_compression_syndrome"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve entrapment","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve_entrapment"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"}]}
