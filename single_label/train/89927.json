{"id":89927,"title":"Commercially available trabecular metal ankle interpositional spacer for tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis secondary to severe bone loss of the ankle.","abstract":"Retrograde tibiotalocalcaneal nailing arthrodesis has proved to be a viable salvage procedure; however, extended bone loss around the ankle has been associated with high rates of nonunion and considerable shortening of the hindfoot. We present the surgical technique and the first 2 cases in which a trabecular metal™ interpositional spacer, specifically designed for tibiotalocalcaneal nailing arthrodesis, was used. The spacer can be implanted using either an anterior or a lateral approach. An integrated hole in the spacer allows a retrograde nail to be inserted, which provides excellent primary stability of the construct. Trabecular metal™ is a well-established and well-described material used to supplement deficient bone stock in surgery of the spine, hip, and knee. It has shown excellent incorporation and reduces the need for auto- and allografts. The trabecular metal™ interpositional ankle spacer is the first trabecular metal spacer designed specifically for ankle surgery. Its shape and variable size will make it a valuable tool for reconstructing bone loss in tibiotalocalcaneal nailing arthrodesis.
