{"id":18558,"title":"[Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV].","abstract":"Globally, an estimated 3.3 million children were living with HIV in 2012 (around 1500 in France) In developed countries, the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 has been reduced to less than 1 %, thanks to the large diffusion of antiretroviral drugs given in pregnant women and in HIV-exposed children. The rare cases of HIV-1 MTCT are due to missed opportunities of HIV diagnosis in pregnant women or to late prescription of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Neonatal screening for HIV in exposed newborns is based on repeated HIV RNA and/or DNA PCR, performed at 1-3days, 1, 3 and 6months of age. Even if the health of HIV-exposed children is not a concern in the vast majority of cases, future challenges will imply to study the potential long-term toxicity of ART because of the description of several biological, clinical and imaging alerts.
