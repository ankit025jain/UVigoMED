{"id":47648,"title":"Initial experience of intraoperative three-dimensional navigation for liver resection using real-time virtual sonography.","abstract":"Real-time virtual sonography is an innovative imaging technology that detects the spatial position of an ultrasound probe and immediately reconstructs a section of computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance in accordance with the ultrasound image, thereby allowing a real-time comparison of those modalities. A novel intraoperative navigation system for liver resection using real-time virtual sonography has been devised for the detection of tumors and navigation of the resection plane.Sixteen patients with hepatic malignancies (26 tumors in total) were involved in this study, and the system was used intraoperatively. The tumor size ranged 2 to 140 mm (23 mm in median). By the navigation system, operators could refer intraoperative ultrasound image displayed on the television monitor side-by-side with corresponding images of CT and/or magnetic resonance. In addition, the system overlaid preoperative simulation on the CT image and highlighted the extent of resection so as to navigate the resection plane. Because the system used electromagnetic power in the operation room, the feasibility and safety of the system was investigated as well as its validity.The system could be used uneventfully in each operation. All of the 26 tumors scheduled to be resected were detected by the navigation system. The weight of the resected specimen correlated with the preoperatively simulated volume (R = 0.995, P < .0001).The feasibility and safety of the navigation system were confirmed. The system should be helpful for intraoperative tumor detection and navigation of liver resection.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579091","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.641817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.514229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.487521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.369287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Electromagnetism","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.157157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.146567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Electromagnetic pulse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse"},{"name":"Video monitor","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_monitor"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Global Positioning System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"},{"name":"Linear map","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Space probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"}]}
