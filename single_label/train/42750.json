{"id":42750,"title":"A cohesive European policy for hepatitis B vaccination, are we there yet?","abstract":"Despite the availability of safe and effective hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines for more than 30 years, the burden of hepatitis B disease is still substantial. In 1992, the WHO recommended the inclusion of HBV vaccination in all national vaccination programmes. As of 2012, 47 of the 53 European countries (89%) had implemented a universal hepatitis B vaccination programme. The most recent countries to follow the recommendation were Ireland (in 2008) and the Netherlands (in 2011). Still, six countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the UK) adopt risk-group-targeted vaccination only, instead of adding a universal vaccination programme. However, changing demography, increasing immigration and the current vaccine costs make the costâ€“benefit ratios in these remaining low endemicity countries strongly in favour of universal HBV vaccination. Global efforts, including a cohesive European vaccination policy, are essential to control and prevent hepatitis B.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829936","annotations":[{"name":"Iceland","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.77844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.617753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.605647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.550251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.546942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.511784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.368345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.363138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.337222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.277566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.186224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.0722665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom_since_1922"},{"name":"Vaccination policy","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_policy"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"1992","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Hepatitis B vaccine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_vaccine"},{"name":"Social cohesion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cohesion"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"}]}
