{"id":1432,"title":"Medication-related problems among community-dwelling older adults after recent hospital discharge in mainland China.","abstract":"Most research about medication-related problems after hospital discharge among older adults has been carried out in Western countries. The experience of older adults in China has not been described.The aim of the study was to explore the prevalence, types, and predictors of medication-related problems among community-dwelling older adults with cardiovascular problems after recent hospital discharge in mainland China.An exploratory, cross-sectional survey design was used. Participants (N = 769) aged 60 and over-discharged with more than one medication-were administered three self-report questionnaires: the demographic questionnaire, the 15-Item Geriatric Depression Scale, and the questionnaire about medication use.Nearly 40% of this sample experienced medication-related problems. Omission (failing to take a dose of medication) was most common (20.4%). Predictors of any medication-related problems included absence of caregiver (OR = 1.71; 95% CI [1.22, 2.39]), depression (OR = 2.56; 95% CI [1.77, 3.71]), and use of more than six medications (OR = 1.39; 95% CI [1.03, 1.87]).Significant attention should be given to older adults in China who are recently discharged from the hospital. Our study highlights the importance of effective interventions to help this group manage their medications well.","date":"2014-10-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25350544","annotations":[{"name":"Western world","weight":0.683605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"China","weight":0.671311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.40628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.37488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.372304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.371555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Geriatric Depression Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatric_Depression_Scale"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Role-playing video game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Undescribed taxon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undescribed_taxon"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"}]}
