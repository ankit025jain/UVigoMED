{"id":22822,"title":"High prevalence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Djibouti: a retrospective study.","abstract":"The Republic of Djibouti is an African country that exhibits one of the highest incidence rate of tuberculosis in the world. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among new cases.We studied retrospectively every tuberculosis case diagnosed over a 12-month period in patients hospitalized at the French Military Hospital of Bouffard. During this period, 1,274 samples from 675 patients were tested.We isolated 266 mycobacteria corresponding to 180 cases of tuberculosis. Thirty-three were fully susceptible and 57% met the tuberculosis criteria, with 46% primary resistance. No extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis was found.Our results highlight a major concern about the situation in this part of the world.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518635","annotations":[{"name":"Djibouti","weight":0.816171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djibouti"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.631967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"France","weight":0.569378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.440647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"French Armed Forces","weight":0.40633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.122128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"266","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/266"},{"name":"Ex post facto law","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law"},{"name":"The Republic (Plato)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_(Plato)"},{"name":"Military hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_hospital"},{"name":"German resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_resistance"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
