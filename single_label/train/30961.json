{"id":30961,"title":"Deaths from violent causes and accidents in Hordaland County 2003-04.","abstract":"Studies of the epidemiology of deaths from violent causes can provide valuable information for the treatment of traumas. We wished to ascertain whether the victims had survivable injuries and were accessible for treatment at the time of discovery of the injury. The purpose was to identify areas of intervention that may help save lives.An overview of deaths from violent causes in Hordaland County in 2003 and 2004 was retrieved from the Cause of Death Registry, and information from autopsy records, hospital records and police reports was reviewed. In each case, an assessment was made of whether the injuries were survivable. If the patient was alive and could be reached and treated at the time when the incident was reported, he/she was defined as accessible for treatment.Altogether 191 deaths were included. We assessed the injuries as survivable in 26 cases. A total of 18 of these 26 patients were also assessed as accessible for treatment. All of these 18 patients died from falls or traffic accidents. 11 of the 18 patients were in the age group 75 years or older; this age group accounted for 41 cases (21.5%) of the total material. The records showed that in 12 of these 18 cases, it had been decided following an overall assessment not to initiate, or to discontinue, further life-saving treatment.A small number of patients were deemed to have sustained survivable injuries while also being accessible for treatment. The results indicate that primarily efforts to prevent injuries will help reduce the number of deaths from violent causes.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24429752","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.731169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Police","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.687908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.557152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.267606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Hordaland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hordaland"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Save (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)"},{"name":"Lifeguard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeguard"},{"name":"Discovery (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
