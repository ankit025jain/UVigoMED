{"id":43554,"title":"[Complex application of laparoscopic vagotomy in case of hard scarring ulcers after gastroduodenal bleeding].","abstract":"654 patients with ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding from duodenum were under observation. It was done the meta-analysis of treatment results of 111 patients with hard scarring duodenal ulcers. It was discovered high efficiency of organ-preserving operations such aslaparoscopic vagotomy and proton pump inhibitors in these observations.
