{"id":53707,"title":"[Postoperative pancreonecrosis prophylaxis in a gastric cancer surgery].","abstract":"Efficacy of a new method of intraoperative regional sympathetic blockade of splanchnic nerves was estimated, basing on the results of surgical treatment of 3134 patients, suffering gastric cancer. While comparing the immediate results of surgical interventions there was established, that the risk of postoperative pancreatitis occurrence (lethality) is dependent on the kind of operation performed and its traumaticity. The risk of postoperative pancreonecrosis occurrence (lethality) lowering after standard surgical and combined intervention, after gastric surgery with pancreatic resection was promoted by application of a spiritus-novocaine blockade with the objective to suppress sympathetic reflexes as an element of anesthesia intraoperatively and in early postoperative period.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502000","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.793516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.523816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.388382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.383838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.317639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Splanchnic nerves","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splanchnic_nerves"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
