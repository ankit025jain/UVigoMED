{"id":67930,"title":"The comparison of double J stent insertion and conservative treatment alone in severe pure gestational hydronephrosis: a case controlled clinical study.","abstract":"Management options of gestational hydronephrosis are based on the coexisting stone disease, pyelonephritis, and renal disease. However, the management option and its consequences in the absence of a coexisting disease state are not clear. In this study we aimed to compare the effectiveness of conservative treatment and double J insertion in symptomatic pure gestational hydronephrosis.The data of the women with severe pure gestational hydronephrosis over a nine-year period was collected retrospectively. The included women were grouped into two according to receiving double J stent insertion or conservative treatments.Double J insertion and conservative treatment groups included 24 and 29 women, respectively. Hydronephrosis was demonstrated on the right, left, or both kidneys in 37 (70%), 13 (24%), and 3 (6%) women, respectively. None of the participants gave birth prior to the 37th week. The demographics, initial pain scores, the severity of the hydronephrosis during first admission, and pain scores one week after the interventions did not differ significantly between groups (P > 0.05). Similarly, the rates of complications, postpartum pain scores, and permanent hydronephrosis did not differ between groups (P > 0.05).Double J insertion in symptomatic pure gestational hydronephrosis adds no benefit to conservative treatment.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574939","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.428679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hydronephrosis","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronephrosis"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.3316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Pyelonephritis","weight":0.115812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyelonephritis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0536471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.0417838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0174429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Double (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
