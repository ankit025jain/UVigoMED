{"id":79513,"title":"Efficacy and safety of arachidonic acid for treatment of Schistosoma mansoni-infected children in Menoufiya, Egypt.","abstract":"Arachidonic acid (ARA), an omega-6 fatty acid, kills juvenile and adult schistosomes in vitro and displays highly significant and safe therapeutic effects in mice and hamsters infected with Schistosoma mansoni or S. haematobium. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of ARA in treatment of school-age children infected with S. mansoni. In total, 66 S. mansoni-infected schoolchildren (20-23 children/study arm) received a single dose of 40 mg/kg praziquantel (PZQ), ARA (10 mg/kg per day for 15 days), or PZQ combined with ARA. The children were examined before and after treatment for worm egg counts in stool and blood biochemical and immunological parameters. ARA proved to be as efficacious as PZQ in treatment of schoolchildren with low infection intensity (78% and 85% cure rates, respectively). For moderate-intensity infection, the ARA and PZQ combination led to 100% cure rate. Biochemical, hematological, and immunological parameters were either unchanged or ameliorated after ARA therapy.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246692","annotations":[{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.628222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.624387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.544231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.466384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Schistosoma haematobium","weight":0.445284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_haematobium"},{"name":"Praziquantel","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praziquantel"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.320546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Schistosoma mansoni","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_mansoni"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.19349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hamster","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"}]}
