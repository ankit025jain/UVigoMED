{"id":71966,"title":"The evaluation of national time trends, quality of care, and factors affecting the use of minimally invasive breast biopsy and open biopsy for diagnosis of breast lesions.","abstract":"Minimally invasive breast biopsy is a recommended biopsy method for suspicious lesions. This study examines national trends and factors associated with the use of open breast biopsy (OBB).The national inpatient sample database was used to examine trends and factors associated with the use of OBB. Factors associated with OBB were evaluated using chi-square test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis.OBB rate was 34%. Patients below 50 years of age had OBB rates of 47%, while those above 50 had OBB rates of 29.1% (P < .001). Higher OBB rates were observed in Asian (39.8%) and Hispanic (40.6%) women compared with white women (34.1%, P < .001). Private insurance patients were more likely to have OBB compared with Medicaid/Medicare patients (40.9% vs 30.6%, P < .001). About 1.2% of women who underwent OBB required multiple biopsies for diagnosis compared with .5% for minimally invasive breast biopsy (P < .001).OBB is still performed in one third of women despite higher morbidity and less accuracy. Factors associated with higher OBB rate included younger age; Asian ethnicity; private insurance; small, rural, and nonteaching hospitals.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015227","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.514272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.326696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.321708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.119821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Private (rank)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Minimum bounding box","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
