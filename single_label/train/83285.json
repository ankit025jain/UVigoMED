{"id":83285,"title":"Ski diminishes TGF-?1-induced myofibroblast phenotype via up-regulating Meox2 expression.","abstract":"The aim of the present work was to investigate the mechanism of transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 and Sloan-Kettering Institute (Ski) in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scars (HS).Wound healing is an inherent process, but the aberrant wound healing of skin injury may lead to HS. There has been growing evidence suggesting a role for TGF-?1 and Ski in the pathogenesis of fibrosis.The MTT assay was used to detect the cell proliferation induced by TGF-?1. The Ski gene was transduced into cells with an adenovirus, and then the function of Ski in cell proliferation and differentiation was observed. Ski mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of ?-SMA, E-cadherin, Meox1, Meox2, Zeb1 and Zeb2.TGF-?1 can promote human skin fibroblast (HSF) cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner, but the promoting effect could be suppressed by Ski. TGF-?1 also induces the formation of the myofibroblast phenotype and the effect of TGF-?1 could be diminished by Ski. Also, Ski modulates the cardiac myofibroblast phenotype and function through suppression of Zeb2 by up-regulating the expression of Meox2.Ski diminishes the myofibroblast phenotype induced by TGF-?1 through the suppression of Zeb2 by up-regulating the expression of Meox2.","date":"2014-12-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445500","annotations":[{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.889968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.807432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Human skin","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.674927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.499514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.386533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.297724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"}]}
