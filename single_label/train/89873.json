{"id":89873,"title":"Case report: traumatic displacement of a cochlear implant magnet.","abstract":"To date, over 200?000 cochlear implants (CIs) have been implanted worldwide and the incidence is still increasing. We present a case of traumatic displacement of CI magnet to raise awareness about this complication and to highlight the need for vigilance during surgery as well as for proper counseling.The clinical presentation of a 1.5-year-old boy with a traumatic displacement of a CI magnet was presented and the literature was reviewed for this rare complication.After minor head injury, the sound processor could no longer connect to the CI. X-ray imaging demonstrated displacement of the CI magnet. During revision surgery, the magnet was replaced by a new magnet in the silicon holding cap. Intraoperative impedance measurements were normal and the CI was successfully activated 4 weeks postoperatively.Clinicians and patients should be aware of the risk of displacement of the CI magnet after (minor) head injury. Young boys tend to have a higher risk for this complication.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671476","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Magnet","weight":0.423995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.39772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.301208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Silicon","weight":0.220727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.172202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Central processing unit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Nintendo S-SMP","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_S-SMP"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
