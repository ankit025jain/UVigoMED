{"id":83190,"title":"Sulcus fluid bone marker levels and the outcome of surgical treatment of peri-implantitis.","abstract":"To analyse change in selected bone markers in peri-implant sulcus fluid (PISF) sampled before treatment and after 12 months and test correlation with change in disease progression.Peri-implant sulcus fluid was sampled from 32 patients in a randomized, clinical study comparing peri-implant defect re-construction with or without porous titanium granules. Matrix metalloproteinase 8 levels were measured using the Quantikine Human Total MMP-8 (DMP800) ELISA. Multianalyte profiling of the level of bone markers [interleukin-6, osteprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin, leptin, osteopontin, parathyroid hormone, tumour necrosis factor-?, adiponectin and insulin] was performed by Luminex using Human Bone Panel IB. Changes in bone marker levels were compared and correlation with clinical findings was tested.No differences in clinical parameter or bone marker levels between test and control group were found. When comparing bone marker levels irrespective of treatment allocation between baseline and 12 months, a significant reduction in total protein, matrix metalloproteinase -8, interleukin-6, OPG, leptin and adiponectin were demonstrated. Positive correlations were found between the reduction in interleukin-6 (r = 0.43), insulin (r = 0.38) and matrix metalloproteinase-8 (r = 0.47) concentration, and probing pocket depth reduction.Peri-implantitis surgical treatment induced some reduction of the studied bone markers. Conclusive evidence for correlation between change in bone marker concentrations with disease resolution was not found.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417563","annotations":[{"name":"Osteopontin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopontin"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.514252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Osteocalcin","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteocalcin"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.331422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.228042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.195016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"}]}
