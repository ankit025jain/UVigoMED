{"id":84464,"title":"[Morphological characteristic of tissues, surrounding prosthesis in patients, suffering cutaneo-prosthetic fistulas and paraprosthetic hernias].","abstract":"While application of the net prostheses in surgery of anterior abdominal wall hernias (AAWH) the complications are noted, such as the prosthesis cyst development, the net wrinkling, migration and separation with the hernia recurrence. Morphological investigation of tissues were conducted in regions of cutaneo-prosthetic fistulas and hernial gates, formatted by the prosthesis edge, in 22 patients, operated for AAWH, in 6 of them cutaneo-prosthetic fistulas were observed. Morphological changes in region of prosthesis, taking part in the hernial defect development, as well as in the wrinkled part of the prosthesis, were characterized by pronounced inflammation, development of rude cicatrices and infiltration of tissues. While durable existence of cutaneo-prosthetic fistulas the prosthesis degradation and destruction occurs as well as the breaks and cracks; on sites of the tissue, surrounding the prosthesis, the microorganisms and fungi vegetations may evolve, trusting its secondary infectioning.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25097974","annotations":[{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.800688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.792657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.651844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.550646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.43407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.367629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.243717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Rudeness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudeness"},{"name":"Vegetation (pathology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation_(pathology)"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Wrinkle (skin)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle_(skin)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
