{"id":4384,"title":"[Survey of infections of soil-transmitted nematodes in Shuyang County, Jiang-su Province, 2011 and 2012].","abstract":"To explore the status of infections of soil-transmitted nematodes of residents in Shuyang County, Jiang-su Province from 2011 to 2012.Totally 2,140 residents of Machang Town and Longji Town in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province were investigated, and their stool samples were collected and detected by Kato-Katz technique, and in addition, the children aged 3-12 years were examined by the cellophane anal swab method, in 2011 and 2012.In 2011, the total infection rate of soil-transmitted nematodes was 1.06% (11/1,034), the infection rate of hookworm was 1.06% (11/1,034), the infection rate of Ascaris lumbricoides was 0, the infection rate of Trichuris trichiura was 0, and the infection rate of Enterobius vermicularis was 0; In 2012, the total infection rate of soil-transmitted nematodes was 0.99% (11/1,106), the infection rate of hookworm was 0.27% (3/1,106), the infection rate of A. lumbricoides was 0.09 (1/1,106), the infection rate of T. trichiura was 0, and the infection rate of E. vermicularis was 2.69% (7/223).The infection rate of soil-transmitted nematodes of residents in Shuyang County is low, but the surveillance is still necessary.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345175","annotations":[{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Ascaris lumbricoides","weight":0.898537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Enterobius","weight":0.772276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobius"},{"name":"Trichuris trichiura","weight":0.746354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris_trichiura"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.694734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.413112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.0589687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Cellophane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellophane"},{"name":"Jiangsu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu"},{"name":"Machang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machang"},{"name":"Shuyang County","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuyang_County"},{"name":"Trichuris","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"}]}
