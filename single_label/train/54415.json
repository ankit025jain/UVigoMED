{"id":54415,"title":"Both gender and concurrent chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis may influence the nuclear texture of papillary thyroid carcinomas cells.","abstract":"A disparity in gender incidence has been reported in both papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) diseases frequently associated and whose incidence has been increasing in parallel. We aimed to analyze differences in morphometric variables between male and female PTC patients and their relationship with the presence of concurrent CLT. The nuclear texture features of 100 hematoxylin-eosin stained nuclei from 100 consecutive classic PTC patients enrolled in our service were compared with their clinical and pathological features, including the presence of CLT. All patients were submitted to a standard management protocol and followed-up for 13-248 months (Mo?=?117 months). Chromatin in women tended to present a denser and more homogeneous structure, in a less mottled pattern, with higher values of energy (p?=?0.008) and diagonal moment (p?=?0.032) than men. Concurrent CLT was more prevalent in women (41.42%) than in men (13.33%, p?=?0.04) and was associated with higher cluster prominence values (p?=?0.027), a parameter that indicates a predominance of high nuclear contrasted heterochromatin. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher cluster prominence was independently correlated with chromatin in patients who presented CLT but did not demonstrate any association between concurrent CLT and gender. We were unable to demonstrate any association between gender and any characteristic of tumor aggressiveness or patients outcome. Our results suggest that chromatin texture of hematoxylin-eosin stained nuclei in paraffin sections of PTC cells is related to both gender and concurrent CLT.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460065","annotations":[{"name":"Cell
