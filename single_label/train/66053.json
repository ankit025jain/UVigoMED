{"id":66053,"title":"[Research progress in mechanisms of drug-induced nephrotoxicity].","abstract":"Drug-induced nephrotoxicity in children is dependent upon the histological, anatomical and physiological features of their kidneys and the structural and functional characteristics of drugs. The kidney is mainly composed of microvascular network and tubulointerstitial tissue, so drug-induced nephrotoxicity is usually manifested by interstitial nephropathy. The mechanisms of drug-induced nephrotoxicity include cytotoxicity (necrosis or apoptosis), ischemic injury, and immunological injury. Individual drugs cause renal damage by various mechanisms due to differences in chemical structure and pharmacology. This article reviews the main features of nephrotoxicity induced by common antibiotics (cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, carbapenems and amphotericin B), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cyclosporine A.
