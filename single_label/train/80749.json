{"id":80749,"title":"Distinctive histopathology and modulation of cytokine production during oral and intraperitoneal Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain infection.","abstract":"Acute Chagas disease outbreaks are related to the consumption of food or drink contaminated by triatomine feces, thus making oral infection an important route of transmission. Both vector-borne and oral infections trigger important cardiac manifestations in the host that are related to a dysregulated immune response. The aims of this work were to evaluate possible alterations of lymphocyte CD4+/CD8+ sub-populations, Th1 and Th2 cytokines, nitrite concentrations and cardiac histopathology. One group of male Wistar rats was intraperitoneally infected (I.P.) with 1×105 metacyclic trypomastigotes of the T. cruzi Y strain, and another group of Wistar rats was orally infected (O.I.) with 8×105 metacyclic trypomastigotes of the same strain. The intraperitoneal infection triggered statistically enhanced parasite and peritoneal macrophage numbers, increased concentrations of NO and IL-12 and elevated cardiac inflammatory foci when compared with the oral infection. However, proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not statistically different for oral and intraperitoneal routes.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552620","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.89595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Trypanosoma cruzi","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.862887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.802763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.741139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Nitrite","weight":0.732136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.731717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.69893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.695798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.68133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.659065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.631202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.575423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.400359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.272668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Triatominae","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triatominae"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Trypanosoma","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"}]}
