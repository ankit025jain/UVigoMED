{"id":85605,"title":"Vascular ring diagnosis following respiratory arrest.","abstract":"Vascular rings can present with non-specific respiratory and/or oesophageal symptoms. Early diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. This case report describes an uncommon acute presentation of a vascular ring. We report a thriving 14-month-old child with a long history of recurrent wheeze and 'noisy breathing'. He presented acutely with food bolus impaction in the oesophagus which led to a respiratory arrest. Oesophagoscopy and bronchoscopy suggested vascular ring anomaly. A contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated a right-sided aortic arch with left ligamentum arteriosum encircling the oesophagus and airway. The ligament was ligated and divided. At follow-up 6?months later, the infant had mild persistent stridor but was otherwise well.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895385","annotations":[{"name":"Stridor","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridor"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.80489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Respiratory arrest","weight":0.707499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_arrest"},{"name":"Wheeze","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeze"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.624575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.597117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Ligamentum arteriosum","weight":0.577318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligamentum_arteriosum"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.466177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.292516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Vascular ring","weight":0.236252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_ring"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0176757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
