{"id":58304,"title":"Internet therapy for postpartum depression: a case illustration of emailed therapeutic assistance.","abstract":"Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts up to 15% of Canadian women following childbirth. Minimal research has focused on therapist-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for PPD. The purpose of this paper was to illustrate this novel treatment approach that was offered to a woman afflicted with PPD. A first-time mother participated in therapist-assisted ICBT for PPD. She completed the seven-module intervention in 12 weeks, sent seven emails to her therapist, and received 13 therapeutic emails. Therapeutic exchanges are presented. Treatment progress, therapeutic alliance, and treatment satisfaction were assessed. Symptom reduction was observed on all measures at post-treatment. Treatment satisfaction and a strong therapeutic alliance were also reported. The case will expand clinician understanding in therapist-assisted ICBT for PPD and may serve to stimulate clinician interest. Future research directions stemming from this case are presented.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965602","annotations":[{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Behaviour therapy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.752389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.709257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.675211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Postpartum depression","weight":0.473701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.376526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Therapeutic relationship","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_relationship"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Email","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Reductionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism"},{"name":"Illustration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustration"}]}
