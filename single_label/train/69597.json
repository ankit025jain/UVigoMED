{"id":69597,"title":"The value of serum FGF-23 as a cardiovascular marker in HD patients.","abstract":"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is a recently discovered regulator of phosphate and mineral metabolism and has been associated with both progression of CKD and mortality in dialysis patients. To evaluate the association between serum FGF-23 levels and echocardiographic measurements in long-term HD (HD) patients without cardiac symptoms, we studied 90 consecutive patients treated in a single HD center (51 males, 39 females; mean age 41.5 ± 14.2 years, mean HD duration 71.2 ± 14.2 months). Comprehensive echocardiography was performed after HD and blood samples were obtained before HD. The serum FGF-23 level in dialysis patients was 95.7 ± 88.4 pg/mL. In univariate analysis, serum calcium levels (r = 0.33, P <0.05), serum creatinine (r = 0.34, P <0.05), serum albumin (r = 0.35, P <0.05) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (r = 0.33, P <0.001) were correlated weakly with the FGF-23 levels. Neither s. phosphorus nor calcium x phosphorus product correlated with FGF-23. In univariate regression analysis, only LVMI [? = 0.42, P <0.05, confidence interval (CI) 0.3-4.3], serum calcium (?= 0.87, P <0.001, CI 0.8-7.3), serum albumin (?= 0.87, P < 0.001, CI 0.8-7.3) and serum creatinine (?= 0.67, P <0.05, CI 0.5-6.5) significantly correlated with FGF-23. FGF-23 was identified as a factor that is weakly associated with LVMI. Thus, FGF-23 alone may not be a parameter that can be used for evaluation of the cardiac status in HD patients.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434381","annotations":[{"name":"Phosphorus","weight":0.821865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.794467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.753783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.745682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.722247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.685683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.648965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.638424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.636988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.573938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.434515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.350845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor 23","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_23"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
