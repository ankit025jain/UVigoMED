{"id":62991,"title":"Comparison of obstetric outcome in terms of the risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, cesarean section rate and anemia in primigravid adolescents and older primigravida.","abstract":"To compare the obstetric outcome in terms of risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, cesarean section rate and anemia in primigravid adolescents and older primigravida.Cohort study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore, from July to December 2012.Three hundred primigravid women presenting to department of obstetrics and gynecology of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore, having live singleton pregnancy, including 150 adolescents (² 19 years) and 150 adults (³ 20 years) were studied. Obstetric outcome in terms of gestational age at delivery, infant's birth weight, presence of anemia and cesarean section rate was compared between two groups. Results were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. Chi-square test was applied with 0.05 as level of significance.The mean age of adolescent subjects was 17.3 + 1.5 years and of adults 25.6 + 3.4 years. Mean gestational age at delivery was similar in two groups (39.2 weeks and 39.4 weeks, p = 0.37). Adolescents were more likely to have a preterm delivery (11.2% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.04) and low birth weight infants (19.3% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.005) than adults. Adolescents were more likely to be anemic (46% vs. 32%, p = 0.01) than adults. However, cesarean section rate was not statistically different between two groups.This study showed that primiparous adolescents have significantly higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm delivery, low birth weight infants and anemia as compared to adult primiparas.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491010","annotations":[{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Obstetrics and gynaecology","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.728732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.667975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Glossary of terms associated with gravidity","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_terms_associated_with_gravidity"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.412392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.352403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.277566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Lahore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"}]}
