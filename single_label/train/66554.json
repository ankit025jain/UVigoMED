{"id":66554,"title":"Crizotinib and renal insufficiency: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"A 69 year old man with idiopathic chronic kidney disease was diagnosed with relapsing EGFR negative, ALK positive lung adenocarcinoma, and treated with chemotherapy and antiangiogenic treatment, under which his renal insufficiency worsened. During second line crizotinib treatment, further worsening of the renal function was seen, with very clear correlation with crizotinib withdrawal and rechallenge. No further drug causes for the worsening blood creatinine values were detected.
