{"id":84995,"title":"[Novel trends in pharmacotherapy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease--prevention of exacerbations (focus on roflumilast)].","abstract":"This report summarizes results of controlled clinical studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor in patients with COPD and to identify the main groups of patients to whom prescription of this medication is indicated and results in reduction of repeated exacerbations. Generally speaking, roflumilast therapy appears justified for patients with symptoms of chronic bronchitis, severe or very severe bronchial obstruction (forced expiratory volume below 50%) and/or frequent exacerbations of the disease (= > 2/12 mo). Manifestations of symptomatic COPD (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, tolerance of physical exercises, etc.) are immaterial for taking decision to introduce roflumilast in combined therapy of COPD.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269184","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.807379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.788896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Bronchitis","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.661694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.56802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.533361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Chronic bronchitis","weight":0.312814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_bronchitis"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Spitting","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0940019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Roflumilast","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roflumilast"},{"name":"PDE4 inhibitor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDE4_inhibitor"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
