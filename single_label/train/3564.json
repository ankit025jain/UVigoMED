{"id":3564,"title":"[Childhood and adolescent cancer was cured--how to support health in adulthood?].","abstract":"The number of long-term survivors after cancer therapy in childhood and young adulthood is increasing. Accordingly, life-long follow-up of significant health problems related to the given cancer therapy is needed as only one third of the survivors will remain free of any physical or psychosocial late effects. At present, national activity is needed to establish a uniform follow-up clinic service to support education, diagnostics, therapy and rehabilitation of these long-term adverse effects after cancer therapy at young age.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558594","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.638002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.559514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.447954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.100046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Political freedom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom"},{"name":"Young adult (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_(psychology)"}]}
