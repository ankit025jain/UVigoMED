{"id":92461,"title":"Combined arthroscopic management of concurrent posterior and anterior ankle pathologies.","abstract":"To determine the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical efficacy of performing simultaneous arthroscopic management in cases with combined posterior and anterior ankle pathologies utilizing previously described standard arthroscopic procedures within a single surgical sitting.Nineteen consecutive patients with combined anterior and posterior ankle pathologies were included in the current study, after at least 6 months of failed conservative managements. Combined standard posterior and anterior ankle arthroscopy was performed in all patients within the same surgical session; first with the patient in the prone position, then with the patient turned onto the supine position to perform the anterior procedure.All patients were available for the follow-up; the median follow-up period was 33 months (range 22-61 months). No persistent neurological deficits or infections were recorded. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle and Hind foot Scale score significantly improved from 70.2 ± 15.2 points preoperatively to reach 93.0 ± 5.4 points at 1 year post-operatively (p < 0.001). Sixteen patients (84.2 %) returned to their previous activity levels.Combined arthroscopic management of concurrent posterior and anterior ankle pathologies within the same surgical session is initially clinically encouraging; it allows for an earlier return to activities of daily living without a significantly added morbidity.Case series, Level IV.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718735","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.590711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.444226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.417662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.373667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.262707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.25196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.238783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.167861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Prone position","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prone_position"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"23rd century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_century"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anosognosia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
