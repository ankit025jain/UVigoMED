{"id":82683,"title":"Histologic lichenoid features in oral dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"This study describes the occurrence of histopathologic characteristics of oral lichenoid mucositis in epithelial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma.This retrospective review examined 352 histologic specimens of group 1 (mild to moderate dysplasia), group 2 (severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ), and group 3 (squamous cell carcinoma) for correlation between 5 histologic characteristics frequently found in oral lichen planus and grade, age, gender, and oral subsite.In this sample, 29% of all cases exhibited 3 or more lichenoid features. Lichenoid features were significantly more frequent in group 1 over group 2 lesions for cases meeting a minimum lichenoid threshold (P = .001). No statistically significant patterns were noted for age or gender. The buccal mucosa was significantly overrepresented (P = .039) and the floor of the mouth was significantly underrepresented (P = .049) in regard to lichenoid feature frequency.This study confirms the frequent correlation of lichenoid characteristics in oral premalignant and malignant lesions.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560560","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lichen planus","weight":0.873304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_planus"},{"name":"Mucositis","weight":0.842506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Carcinoma in situ","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma_in_situ"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Mucosal lichen planus","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosal_lichen_planus"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.497652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.2986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Lichen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Malapportionment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapportionment"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
