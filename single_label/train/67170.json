{"id":67170,"title":"Evaluation of a new ultrasound measurement tool for the diagnosis of dysfunctional voiding in pediatric population: full/empty bladder wall thickness ratio.","abstract":"To investigate the roles of bladder wall thickness (BWT) measurement and full/empty (F/E) BWT measurement ratio in the diagnosis of dysfunctional voiding in pediatric population.Totally, 324 patients were involved in this prospective study, and group 1 consisted of healthy children (n=198), and group 2 consisted of patients with dysfunctional voiding (n=126). BWT measurements were done at the anterior, posterior, and lateral walls, and F/E BWT ratios were calculated. Two groups were compared for BWT measurement, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to find out a cutoff value for BWT and F/E BWT ratios.Mean age of group 1 was 6.4 years and that of group 2 was 6.5 years. BWT measurements were higher in the empty state compared with full state and in boys compared with girls. However, BWT ratios did not show significant difference between male and female patients. F/E BWT ratios were found to be higher in group 2 compared with group 1 (P=.02). In receiver operating characteristic analysis, a cutoff value of 0.324 (sensitivity 66.67% and specificity 79.80%) and 0.295 (sensitivity 83.33% and specificity 64.14%) was found for anterior and posterior F/E BWT rates, respectively.Ultrasonographic measurement of BWT and calculation of F/E BWT ratio may serve as a noninvasive tool for evaluating lower urinary tract symptoms in children. Further studies including larger number of patients would be of great interest.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642076","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.818972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.185865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.185761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.152483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"324","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/324"},{"name":"295","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/295"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Burrows-Wheeler transform","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Calculation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
