{"id":42974,"title":"Drug-induced injury in the gastrointestinal tract.","abstract":"Abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract due to drug-induced injuries are common and often have important clinical consequences. Medications may cause damage by direct corrosive effects on mucosae or by alter processes, mucosal immunity, and local environmental conditions. The aim of this review is to guide practicing pathologists in the identification of drug-related injuries in gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies and resection specimens. Common causes of injury and their gross, endoscopic, and microscopic features are presented.
