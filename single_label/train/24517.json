{"id":24517,"title":"Simultaneous infection with Shigella sonnei and Vibrio cholerae in a young child.","abstract":"A 20-month-old infant presented to the emergency department with diarrhea and vomiting of six days duration. Blood, stool and urine specimens were collected for both bacteriological culture and parasitic workup. Concurrent infections with both Shigella sonnei and Vibrio cholerae were determined to be the cause of the infectious diarrhea. This case illustrates the importance of the microbiology laboratory in detecting infrequently seen enteric pathogens. We will also review the pathogenesis and laboratory diagnosis of Vibrio cholerae and Shigella sonnei.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432507","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.719301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.704684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Shigella","weight":0.677892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.636874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.545084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Vibrio cholerae","weight":0.313223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.0501171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Shigella sonnei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella_sonnei"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Infectious diarrhea","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_diarrhea"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
