{"id":74373,"title":"Minimally invasive techniques for epilepsy surgery: stereotactic radiosurgery and other technologies.","abstract":"Minimally invasive surgical techniques for the treatment of medically intractable epilepsy, which have been developed by neurosurgeons and epileptologists almost simultaneously with standard open epilepsy surgery, provide benefits in the traditional realms of safety and efficacy and the more recently appreciated realms of patient acceptance and costs. In this review, the authors discuss the shortcomings of the gold standard of open epilepsy surgery and summarize the techniques developed to provide minimally invasive alternatives. These minimally invasive techniques include stereotactic radiosurgery using the Gamma Knife, stereotactic radiofrequency thermocoagulation, laser-induced thermal therapy, and MRI-guided focused ultrasound ablation.
