{"id":12542,"title":"[Molecular mechanism of ORFV intervention strategies based on the UPS of host cell: a review].","abstract":"In order to compete the antiviral effects of the host cell in the process of infection, ORFV(known as Orf virus) relies on a series of functional genes developed through long-term population evolution, such as interferon resistance genes, Bcl-2 protein genes and cell cycle inhibitor gene and so on, with these weapons this virus is able to effectively counteract immune clearance and immune regulation from a host cell. Concurrently, ORFV also focuses on exploiting signal transduction pathways of the ubiquitin-proteasome system(UPS), circumvents the intracellular signal transduction and CD8+ T activation, for shielding virus particles towards maturation and releasing outside. This review introduced inner link between the UPS of host cell and intervention mechanism by virus, and analyzed the key roles of certains components in UPS, these all together showed the evolution tendency of ORFV that was involved in the designing of inhibition to immune response and for intracellular immune escape upon the selection pressure in host cell infected.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520774","annotations":[{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.766821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.741301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.586575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.540761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.526825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Evolutionary pressure","weight":0.262604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_pressure"},{"name":"Orf (disease)","weight":0.219945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orf_(disease)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.211102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Chemical shift","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_shift"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Signalling theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
