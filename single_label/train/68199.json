{"id":68199,"title":"Extravasation during bladder cancer metastasis requires cortactin?mediated invadopodia formation.","abstract":"Invasive cancer cells form the filamentous actin?based membrane protrusions known as invadopodia. Invadopodia are thought to play a critical role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis due to their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix. The present study assessed whether invadopodia formation is essential in extravasation of circulating bladder cancer cells and lung metastasis. To analyze the importance of invadopodia, bladder cancer cell lines with reduced invadopodia formation were established by silencing the expression of cortactin, an essential component of invadopodia, using cortactin short hairpin RNA. Bladder cancer cells with cortactin knockdown demonstrated a markedly decreased ability to form invadopodia, secrete matrix metalloproteinases and invade the extracellular matrix. In addition, the knockdown cells exhibited a reduced transendothelial invasion capacity and decreased formation of metastatic foci in the lungs. The present study demonstrated that bladder cancer cells with cortactin knockdown have a reduced capacity to extravasate into the lung from the circulation, due to the decreased invasive character of invadopodia. This suggests that invadopodia formation is a critical process for cancer cell extravasation.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549769","annotations":[{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Invadopodia","weight":0.856024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invadopodia"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Leukocyte extravasation","weight":0.744069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocyte_extravasation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.71171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.564316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.534572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.417445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.348644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Extravasation","weight":0.263318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravasation"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Small hairpin RNA","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hairpin_RNA"},{"name":"Microfilament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfilament"}]}
