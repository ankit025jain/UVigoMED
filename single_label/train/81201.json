{"id":81201,"title":"Treatment planning and dental rehabilitation of periodontally compromised partially edentulous patient: a case report - part II.","abstract":"When planning a prosthetic rehabilitation of a periodontally compromised case, the clinician is often confronted with difficulties and dilemmas related to selecting the appropriate treatment that would provide long-term successful outcomes in function and esthetics. In such cases, a correct diagnosis and prognosis of the intraoral situation supported by evidence-based dentistry is the basis for the establishment of a proper treatment strategy. In this second part of a two-part treatment planning series, a systematic approach of patient examination and prognosis of each tooth is presented. Furthermore, different removable and fixed treatment possibilities are described and the rationale governing the decision-making process is revealed. The execution of the final treatment plan as specified by the concept of comprehensive dental care is outlined, and the final outcome is discussed according to the literature.
