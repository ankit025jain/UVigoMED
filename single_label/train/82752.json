{"id":82752,"title":"Treatment of a rare ganglioneuroma with resection and reconstruction of the mandible: a case report and literature review.","abstract":"Ganglioneuromas are rare neuroblastic tumors that develop from the neural crests of the sympathetic nervous system. Because ganglioneuromas of the mandible have been infrequent, they do not have a standardized management protocol. As of 2000, only 5 cases had been reported. Ganglioneuromas are unique tumors that can undergo histologic maturation from a malignancy to a benign variant. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy with a ganglioneuroma of the mandible and the results of surgical management, including immediate reconstruction with a free fibula microvascular flap.
