{"id":10243,"title":"Stabilized human TRIM5? protects human T cells from HIV-1 infection.","abstract":"Rhesus (rh) but not human (hu) TRIM5? potently restricts human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. It is not clear why huTRIM5? fails to effectively block HIV infection, but it is thought to have a lower affinity for the viral core. Using primary human CD4 T cells, we investigated the ability of huTRIM5?, rhTRIM5?, and the huTRIM5?R323-332 B30.2/SPRY patch-mutant to form cytoplasmic bodies, postulated as key components of the HIV-1 restriction apparatus. Both rhTRIM5? and huTRIM5?R323-332 formed pronounced cytoplasmic bodies, whereas cytoplasmic bodies in T cells overexpressing huTRIM5? were present but more difficult to detect. As expression of all three TRIM5? orthologs was similar at the RNA level, we next investigated the role of protein stability in conferring TRIM5?-mediated HIV-1 restriction. Both steady-state and pulse-chase experiments revealed that the huTRIM5? protein was much less stable than rhTRIM5?, and this difference correlated with higher self-ubiquitination activity. Using a stabilized form of huTRIM5? in which the steady-state expression level was more similar to rhTRIM5?, we observed comparable HIV-1 restriction activity in multi-round HIV-1 challenge assays. Lastly, primary human CD4 T cells expressing a stabilized huTRIM5? were protected from HIV-1-mediated destruction in vivo, indicating that efforts to stabilize huTRIM5? should have significant long-term therapeutic value.
