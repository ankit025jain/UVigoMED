{"id":38807,"title":"Diagnosis and surgical treatment of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A.","abstract":"This study aims to introduce the diagnosis and surgical treatment of the rare disease multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A).Thirteen cases of MEN 2A were diagnosed as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma by biochemical tests and imaging examination. They were treated by bilateral adrenal tumor excision or laparoscopic surgery.Nine patients were treated by bilateral adrenal tumor excision and the remaining four were treated by laparoscopic surgery for pheochromocytoma. Ten patients were treated by total thyroidectomy and bilateral lymph nodes dissection and the remaining three were treated by unilateral thyroidectomy for MTC. Up to now, three patients have died of MTC distant metastasis.We confirmed that MEN 2A can be diagnosed by biochemical tests and imaging examination when genetic testing is not available. Surgical excision is the predominant way to treat MEN 2A; pheochromocytoma should be excised at first when pheochromocytoma and MTC occur simultaneously.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400812","annotations":[{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia","weight":0.79508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_endocrine_neoplasia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.772623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.747562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Medullary thyroid cancer","weight":0.643078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.312002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2","weight":0.233022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_type_2"},{"name":"Adrenal tumor","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_tumor"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.124458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
