{"id":50529,"title":"Correlations of abnormal ultrasound audio-visual images of ovarian cortex surface and pelvic adhesion in infertile patients.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the related factors between abnormal ultrasonic appearance of ovarian and pelvic adhesion in infertile women.Forty-eight cases were examined with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) if there was pelvic adhesion before surgery (experiment group), and the surgical group was used as control. The specificity of pelvic adhesion was evaluated.Thirty-nine cases were abnormal in experiment group and 38 cases were confirmed with surgery, while one case was normal. Nine cases were normal in study group and six cases were confirmed with surgery, while three cases were abnormal. There were 91.7% (44/48) in coincidence rate and 97.4% (38/39) in positive predictive value.Infertility in women with pelvic adhesion with abnormal ovarian appearance, may be examined specifically with TVUS.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779243","annotations":[{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Gynecologic ultrasonography","weight":0.721358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecologic_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.627932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.399023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.375267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.276462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Predictive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_medicine"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Audio-visual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio-visual"},{"name":"Coincidence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence"}]}
