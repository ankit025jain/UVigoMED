{"id":22973,"title":"Periprosthetic tuberculosis of the knee joint treated with antituberculosis drugs: a case report.","abstract":"We report a 55-year old man with periprosthetic tuberculosis infection following a total knee arthroplasty surgery performed during an active tuberculosis infection. The patient was conservatively treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs and retention of prosthesis. There was no recurrence during an 18-month follow-up period. Tuberculosis arthritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with osteoarthritis requiring replacement surgery. Conservative treatment with antituberculosis drugs may be an option in periprosthetic tuberculosis infections without loosening.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509226","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.629535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.599321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.443838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.422564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"}]}
