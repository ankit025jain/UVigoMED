{"id":82239,"title":"Appropriate and necessary oral care for people with cancer: guidance to obtain the right oral and dental care at the right time.","abstract":"The identification of experienced and knowledgeable dental specialists to provide appropriate oral care for cancer patients, as well as the integration of this care within general oncology management, may be a challenge. This paper discusses the general and additional requirements for dental care providers to support the cancer patient and provide prevention and/or treatment for oral complications of cancer therapy.We performed a literature review of specific issues regarding the oral cavity and adjacent structures in the cancer patient, including detection and early diagnosis of oral malignancy. We incorporated the systemic effects of cancer and its therapy that affect oral disease and treatment. We present a summary of how to seek expert dental care for cancer patients and for referral from the dental and medical community.Due to the complexity conferred by the disease and its treatment, cancer patients require educated, experienced dentists for treatment and/or prevention of oral-related morbidity. Correct diagnosis and evidence-based prophylactic and therapeutic oral care can significantly improve patient quality of life and reduce morbidity and healthcare costs.The knowledge and expertise of dental professionals regarding prevention/treatment of complications and secondary malignant lesions in cancer patients are critical. Integration of oral care with the oncology care and in survivors requires effective communication between dental and medical providers beginning ideally at diagnosis. These clinicians may be identified at the cancer center, nearby hospital dental programs, and, less commonly, in the community.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676676","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.758399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.665585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.653499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.599351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.531224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.472082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.386317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.33012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.292493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Oral medicine","weight":0.25322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_medicine"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.139479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.112161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Alternative cancer treatments","weight":0.0585634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_cancer_treatments"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Mouth disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_disease"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
