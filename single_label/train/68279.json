{"id":68279,"title":"Comparison of the safety and efficacy of one-shot and telescopic metal dilatation in percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"Minimizing X-ray exposure during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is challenging. Using the single semirigid dilator, also called \"one-shot\" or \"one-stage\" is a good alternative to routine telescopic metal dilators to reduce X-ray exposure. Our aim was to compare the single semirigid one-shot dilator with a telescopic metal dilator in PCNL. The intraoperative status was evaluated in 100 consecutive patients randomly assigned to two equal groups undergoing PCNL either with the one-shot (group A) or telescopic technique (group B). No significant difference in stone burden and location existed between the groups (P > 0.05). The mean age of group A and group B was 44.8 ± 15 and 45.6 ± 14 years, respectively (P = 0.78). The mean operation time was 51.14 ± 40.85 min in group A and 57.00 ± 38.85 min in group B (P = 0.46). The mean X-ray exposure time was 41.2 ± 17 and 48.4 ± 15 s in group A and group B, respectively (P = 0.03). The stone-free rate was 94 % (n = 47) in group A and 84 % (n = 42) in group B (P = 0.10). The mean hemoglobin drop was 1.26 ± 0.09 and 1.44 ± 0.11 g/dl in group A and group B, respectively (P = 0.09). The one-shot technique is feasible, safe, and well tolerated in patients undergoing PCNL. In addition to lack of complications, the method also provides less radiation exposure for urologists and nursing teams.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531816","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.940946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.210374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.17521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0460588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_nephrolithotomy"},{"name":"Dirasha language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirasha_language"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Telescope","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Shutter speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_speed"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"One-shot (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Dilator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilator"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"The Strip (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strip_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Minimisation (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimisation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"}]}
