{"id":90776,"title":"[Current topics over updating guidelines on the management and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis].","abstract":"Glucocorticoids (GCs) were widely used for the treatment of various disorders. Since GC-induced bone loss is most rapid during the initial 3 - 6 months and primary prevention of bone loss is especially important, guidelines for management of GC-induced osteoporosis have been published overseas and in Japan. In response to changes in the circumstances surrounding GIO regarding fracture assessment tool and drug therapy, ACR revised recommendations incorporated FRAXÂ®, the WHO fracture risk assessment tool and the Japanese Society of Bone and Mineral Research have finished revision work of the guidelines and the updated guideline will be published soon.
