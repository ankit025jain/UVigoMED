{"id":45889,"title":"The accuracy of colonoscopic localisation of colorectal tumours: a prospective, multi-centred observational study.","abstract":"Colonoscopy is essential for accurate pre-operative colorectal tumour localisation, but its accuracy for localisation remains undetermined due to limitations of previous work. This study aimed to establish the accuracy of colonoscopic localisation and to determine how frequently inaccuracy results in altered surgical management.A prospective, multi-centred, powered observational study recruited 79 patients with colorectal tumours that underwent curative surgical resection. Patient and colonoscopic factors were recorded. Pre-operative colonoscopic and radiological lesion localisations were compared to intra-operative localisation using pre-defined anatomical bowel segments to determine accuracy, with changes in planned surgical management documented.Colonoscopy accurately located the colorectal tumour in 64/79 patients (81%). Five out of 15 inaccurately located patients required on-table alteration in planned surgical management. Pre-operative imaging was unable to visualise the primary tumour in 23.1% of cases, a finding that was more prevalent amongst bowel screener patients compared to symptomatic patients (45.8% vs. 13%; p?=?0.003).Colonoscopic lesion localisation is inaccurate in 19.0% of cases and occurred throughout the colon with a change in on-table surgical management in 6.3%. With CT unable to visualise lesions in just under a quarter of cases, particularly in the screening population, preoperative localisation is heavily reliant on colonoscopy.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659380","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.755043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.373346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0555992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0174429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
