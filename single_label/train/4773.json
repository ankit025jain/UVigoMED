{"id":4773,"title":"[The prevalence of active infection with viruses from the family Herpesviridae among members of families with children].","abstract":"Cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) is one of the most common viral infections during pregnancy and one of the most common causes of birth defects in newborns. CMV infection occurs mostly through close contact with small children who can secrete the virus in saliva and urine. Children, especially in preschool and early school can also be a source of infection with other herpesviruses. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of active infections caused by viruses from the family Herpesviridae (CMV, EBV, VZV) among members of families with children.The study included 24 families raising children aged from 2 to 18 years. From all members of the families (46 adults and 39 children) saliva samples were collected from which DNA was extracted. The isolated DNA samples were tested for the presence of CMV, EBV, VZV genetic material by nested PCR. In addition, each family carried out a survey.The presence of CMV DNA in saliva samples were detected in members of 7 families and the presence of EBV DNA were detected in members of 11 families. Total DNA of CMV was detected in 8/85 samples of saliva (9.41%), of which 1/46 adults (2.17%) and 7/39 children (17.95%) and EBV DNA was detected in 18/85 tested saliva samples (21,18%) - 13/46 samples from adults (28,26%) and 5/39 samples from children (12,82%). VZV DNA was not detected in any of the tested saliva samples. The obtained results indicate that the active, asymptomatic infections with lymphotropic herpesviruses are common and affect more than 10% (CMV) and 20% (EBV) subjects.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369658","annotations":[{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Varicella zoster virus","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.577114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.520555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.432968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.401002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.375564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Parenting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"}]}
