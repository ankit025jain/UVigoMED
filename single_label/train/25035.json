{"id":25035,"title":"Novel emboli protection system during cardiac surgery: a multi-center, randomized, clinical trial.","abstract":"Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during open-heart surgery. Up to 60% of intraoperative cerebral events are emboli induced. This randomized, controlled, multicenter trial is the first human study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a novel aortic cannula producing simultaneous forward flow and backward suction for extracting solid and gaseous emboli from the ascending aorta and aortic arch upon their intraoperative release.Sixty-six patients (25 females; 68±10 years) undergoing elective aortic valve replacement surgery, with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were randomized to the use of the CardioGard (CardioGard Medical, Or-Yehuda, Israel) Emboli Protection cannula (\"treatment\") or a standard (\"control\") aortic cannula. The primary endpoint was the volume of new brain lesions measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Device safety was investigated by comparisons of complications rate, namely neurologic events, stroke, renal insufficiency and death.Of 66 patients (34 in the treatment group), 51 completed the presurgery and postsurgery MRI (27 in the treatment group). The volume of new brain lesion for the treatment group was (mean±standard error of the mean) 44.00±64.00 versus 126.56±28.74 mm3 in the control group (p=0.004). Of the treatment group, 41% demonstrated new postoperative lesions versus 66% in the control group (p=0.03). The complication rate was comparable in both groups.The CardioGard cannula is safe and efficient in use during open-heart surgery. Efficacy was demonstrated by the removal of a substantial amount of emboli, a significant reduction in the volume of new brain lesions, and the percentage of patients experiencing new brain lesions.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25258158","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.892916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.855555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.820679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.809475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Brain damage","weight":0.741161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Aortic valve replacement","weight":0.684657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.495649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.459931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.344744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.241547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0691456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Democracy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy"}]}
