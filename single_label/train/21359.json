{"id":21359,"title":"Sequential administration of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults 60-64 years of age.","abstract":"Unlike free pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPSVs), pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) induce a T-cell-dependent immune response. The study assessed potential influence of initial 13-valent PCV (PCV13) or 23-valent PPSV (PPSV23) on subsequent vaccine administrations.We conducted a randomized, modified double-blind study in 720 pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults 60-64 years of age. Subjects received either PCV13 at year 0 and PCV13 at year 1; PCV13 at year 0 and PPSV23 at year 1; or PPSV23 at year 0 and PCV13 at year 1. Antipneumococcal opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers were measured before and 1 month after each vaccination.OPA titers following PPSV23 given 1 year after PCV13 (PCV13/PPSV23) (a) were noninferior for the 12 common serotypes and significantly higher for 6 of 12 common serotypes than those following only an initial PPSV23; and (b) were significantly higher for 11 of 12 common serotypes compared with PPSV23 followed by PCV13 (PPSV23/PCV13). In addition, PPSV23 followed 1 year later by PCV13 (PPSV23/PCV13) elicited significantly lower OPA titers than after only an initial dose of PCV13 for all 13 serotypes. Responses after a second vaccination with either PCV13 (PCV13/PCV13) or PPSV23 (PCV13/PPSV23) were noninferior for 9 of 13 and 8 of 12 common serotypes compared with the initial PCV13 dose.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606865","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.7558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine","weight":0.676801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_polysaccharide_vaccine"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.511024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"Presidency of Bill Clinton","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"0 (year)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(year)"}]}
