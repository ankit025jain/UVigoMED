{"id":87365,"title":"[Extorsion traction and pushing manipulation with fingers for the treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation in elderly].","abstract":"To investigate a manipulating therapy for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation in elderly.From October 2011 to June 2012,27 elderly patients with anterior shoulder dislocation were treated by extorsion traction and pushing manipulation with fingers, including 7 males and 20 females aged from 65 to 86 years old with an average of 77. The course of disease ranged from 1 h to 1 d. The shoulder manifested square deformity, Dugus signs showed positive, and X-ray displayed anterior shoulder dislocation. Dugus fixation was applied for and removed external fixation at 3 weeks after operation and carried out shoulder functional exercise. Functional evaluation standard on shoulder joint injuries was used for evaluate clinical outcomes.All patients were gained reduction for the first time, and followed up at 3 months after operation, no dislocation occurred. According to functional evaluation standard on shoulder joint injuries, 22 cases got an excellent result,2 cases good,and 1 case moderate.Extorsion traction and pushing manipulating therapy for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation in elderly, which has advantages of simple, convenient, less painful, and can avoid iatrogenic injury, is feasible to widespread.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241476","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0693105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0442971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Dislocated shoulder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.0185404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Fixation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(psychology)"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
