{"id":83378,"title":"Sensitivity of passive diarrhea surveillance in infants up to the second year of life in Ma?opolskie voivodeship.","abstract":"In EU countries and also in Poland, the surveillance of infectious acute gastro-enteritis is a mandatory system based on cases notification (suspected and confirm) conducted by physicians in hospitals and ambulatory care.The assessment of surveillance sensitivity on acute diarrhea in children up to 2nd year of life in Ma?opolskie voivodeship from 2009 to 2012.The data about 720 infants surveyed respectively from birth up to 2nd year of life were used in this study. The information on acute diarrhea cases (outpatient and hospitalized) occurred in infants during follow-up was included in analysis. The data derived from medical records. Each case of acute diarrhea in infants detected by medical records was surveyed in local surveillance system on infectious diseases whether it was notified by physician.The surveillance sensitivity on acute diarrhea in infants up to 2nd year of life increased in Ma?opolskie voivodeship from 14.3% in 2009 to 24.3% in 2012. The sensitivity of surveillance on hospitalized cases was twofold higher compared to all kind of cases assessed inclusively.The surveillance sensitivity on acute diarrhea in infants up to 2nd year of life improved significantly in recent years but is still too low, especially with respect to outpatient cases.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25391009","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.887724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.558091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.50129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.484171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.45777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.41087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.290398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.191112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.139357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Voivodeship","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivodeship"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"January 22","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_22"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Notification system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notification_system"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"}]}
