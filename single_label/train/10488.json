{"id":10488,"title":"Nimesulide/methyl ?-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes: physicochemical characterization, solubility, dissolution, and biological studies.","abstract":"Nimesulide (NIM) is an insoluble nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Complexation of drug with methyl ?-cyclodextrin was evaluated to improve solubility and dissolution rate of NIM. Complexation was achieved via a coevaporation technique to obtain different drug to polymer molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3). The physicochemical characterization of the systems using powder X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy was carried out to understand the influence of this technological process on the physical status of single components and complex systems and to detect possible interactions between drug and carrier. Moreover, quantitative solubility and in vitro dissolution studies of NIM alone and NIM inclusion complexes were studied in the dissolution media of phosphate buffer pH?5.5 and 7.4. The analysis provided existence of a molecular interaction between drug and carrier together in the complex state. The study showed that the inclusion systems enhanced of drug solubility, dissolution rate, and anti-inflammatory activity.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648149","annotations":[{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.80489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.704589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.693074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.672841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.622055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Physical chemistry","weight":0.492511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cyclodextrin","weight":0.476026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclodextrin"},{"name":"Diffraction","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.414162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.206296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.148932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.0334287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.0312312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Complex systems","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems"}]}
