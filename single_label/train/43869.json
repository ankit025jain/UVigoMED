{"id":43869,"title":"Venous thrombosis in a child with ulcerative colitis in remission: a case report.","abstract":"Over the past 70 years, an association between venous thromboembolism and inflammatory bowel disease has been described. We report on a thirteen year old boy with ulcerative colitis and venous thrombosis. Literature on incidence of venous thromboembolism in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is reviewed as well as the possible pathogenetic mechanisms of this 'hypercoagulable state': role of acquired risk factors, inflammation, coagulation abnormalities and platelets. Finally, treatment of IBD and thrombosis is discussed.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761694","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.73383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.638467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.394585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.312485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"}]}
