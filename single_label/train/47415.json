{"id":47415,"title":"CT-guided radioactive ¹²?I seed implantation treatment of multiple pulmonary metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"To investigate the clinical value of computed tomography (CT)-guided radioactive (125)I seed implantation for the treatment of multiple pulmonary metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).From March 2007 to August 2010, 27 HCC patients with pulmonary metastases who had received computed tomography (CT)-guided radioactive (125)I seed implantation were enrolled in the study. All patients had ? 2 metastatic lesions (mean diameter 2 ± 0.6 cm). Under CT-guidance, (125)I seeds were implanted into the pulmonary metastases using the plane implantation technique.Among 27 cases, complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were observed in four, 15, six, and two cases, respectively, during 6-48 months (mean 20.1 ± 2.2 months) of follow-up CT. The response rate was 92.6%. The mean follow-up time after (125)I implantation was 20.1 months (range 6-48 months). The survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 67% and 30.8%, respectively, with a median survival of 13.5 months. Side effects during the procedure included minor pulmonary effusions and pneumothorax. Pulmonary haemorrhage was observed in 18 cases and haemoptysis occurred in five patients. Radial shadows were observed in three cases on follow-up CT images, and seed migration in two cases on follow-up spiral CT images.CT-guided radioactive (125)I seed implantation may be a safe and effective treatment option for HCC patients with multiple pulmonary metastases.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589447","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.487304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.468693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.364669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.286399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.262474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.191112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Pulmonary hemorrhage","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Iodine-125","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-125"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"}]}
