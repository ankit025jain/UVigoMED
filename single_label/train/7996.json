{"id":7996,"title":"The therapeutic potential of anti-interleukin-20 monoclonal antibody.","abstract":"Interleukin (IL)-20, a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, was discovered in 2001. IL-20 acts on multiple cell types by activating on a heterodimer receptor complex of either IL-20R1-IL-20R2 or IL-22R1-IL-20R2. Recent evidence indicates that IL-20's interaction with its receptors might have proinflammatory effects on chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoporosis, and breast cancer. Updated information about IL-20, such as its identification, expression, receptors, signaling, and biological activities, is illustrated in this review based on our research and the data available in the literature. IL-20 is a pleiotropic cytokine, which promotes inflammation, angiogenesis, and chemotaxis. IL-20 also regulates osteoclast differentiation by altering the receptor activator of NF-?B (RANK) and RANK ligand (RANKL) axis. Inflammation, angiogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis are critical for the pathogenesis of RA, osteoporosis, and breast cancer-induced osteolysis. Based on the in vitro and in vivo data and clinical samples, we demonstrated that IL-20 plays pivotal roles in these three diseases. In experimental models, anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody ameliorates arthritis severity, protects against ovariectomized-induced bone loss, and inhibits breast tumor-induced osteolysis. This review presents the clinical implications of IL-20, which will lead to a better understanding of the biological functions of IL-20 in these diseases and provide new therapeutic options in the future.
