{"id":88749,"title":"The Behavioural Assessment of Self-Structuring (BASS): psychometric properties in a post-acute brain injury rehabilitation programme.","abstract":"Jackson et al. (this edition) argue that structure is an important component in reducing the handicaps caused by cognitive impairments following acquired brain injury and that post-acute neuropsychological brain injury rehabilitation programmes should not only endeavour to provide structure but also aim to develop self-structuring. However, at present there is no standardized device for assessing self-structuring.To provide preliminary analysis of the psychometric properties of the Behavioural Assessment of Self-Structuring (BASS) staff rating scale (a 26 item informant five point rating scale based on the degree of support client requires to achieve self-structuring item).BASS data was utilised for clients attending residential rehabilitation. Reliability (inter-rarer and intra-rater), validity (construct, concurrent and discriminate) and sensitivity to change were investigated.Initial results indicate that the BASS has reasonably good reliability, good construct validity (via principal components analysis), good discriminant validity, and good concurrent validity correlating well with a number of other outcome measures (HoNOS; NPDS, Supervision Rating Scale, MPAI, FIM and FAM). The BASS did not correlate well with the NPCNA. Finally, the BASS was shown to demonstrate sensitivity to change.Although some caution is required in drawing firm conclusions at the present time and further exploration of the psychometric properties of the BASS is required, initial results are encouraging for the use of the BASS in assessing rehabilitation progress. These findings are discussed in terms of the value of the concept of self-structuring to the rehabilitation process for individuals with neuropsychological impairments consequent on acquired brain injury.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796443","annotations":[{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.620819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.565484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.517981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.401695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Concurrent validity","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_validity"},{"name":"Discriminant validity","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant_validity"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.164059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.116551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Discriminant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Finnish markka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_markka"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Football Association of Malaysia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Malaysia"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Supervisor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor"},{"name":"Bassmaster Classic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassmaster_Classic"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Customer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Residential area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_area"},{"name":"Consequent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
