{"id":8477,"title":"First report of Kudoa species in the somatic muscle of the Japanese parrotfish Calotomus japonicus (Scaridae) and a description of Kudoa igami, n. sp. (Myxozoa: Multivalvulida).","abstract":"Three species of the Kudoid parasite (Myxozoa: Multivalvulida) were observed in the somatic muscle of Japanese parrotfish Calotomus japonicus caught off the coast of western Japan. All three species formed pseudocysts in myofibers and caused subclinical infections. The three Kudoa species were distinguished by spore morphology, as well as their 18S and 28S rDNA sequences. We identified a previously undescribed taxa Kudoa igami n. sp. with spores that were stellate with rounded peripheral edges and five to six polar capsules (prevalence 29.3%). Kudoa igami n. sp. were morphologically most similar to Kudoa neothunni but were distinguishable by a more rounded shape in the apical view. Molecular analyses demonstrated that the K. igami n. sp. is closely related to Kudoa thalassomi; however, the similarity in the 28S rDNA sequence was <96% and the spore morphology was different. We found Kudoa thalassomi in one sample (prevalence 2.4%), which is a new host and geographical record for this species. Kudoa lateolabracis, which causes postmortem myoliquefaction in Chinese sea bass Lateolabrax sp. and olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus was found in Japanese parrotfish (prevalence 41.5%) for the first time, but did not cause myoliquefaction. We also expanded the host record for the brain-infecting Kudoa yasunagai (prevalence 94.1%). In addition, an unidentified microsporidia was observed in the somatic muscle (prevalence 23.3%).","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770717","annotations":[{"name":"Spore","weight":0.834323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore"},{"name":"Microsporidia","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Taxon","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Myxozoa","weight":0.732693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxozoa"},{"name":"Parrotfish","weight":0.693984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrotfish"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Flounder","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flounder"},{"name":"China","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.335884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.282138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.231793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Polar region","weight":0.175612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_region"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"18S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Sea","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"28S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Olive","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Undescribed taxon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undescribed_taxon"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Nomen nudum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomen_nudum"},{"name":"Pseudocyst","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocyst"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Western culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"}]}
