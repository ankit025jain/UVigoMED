{"id":63719,"title":"[Impact of induced therapy before allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome: experience of single centre].","abstract":"To explore the impact of prior-to-transplantation induction therapy (IT) on patient outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) for higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).A total of 49 consecutive patients underwent Allo-HSCT for MDS between November 2002 and December 2012. Twenty-six lower-risk MDS cases received supportive therapy (ST). And 17/23 cases of higher-risk MDS received IT prior to transplantation while another 6 only with ST. Their survival, relapse rate and incidence of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) were retrospectively analyzed according to International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores and marrow blast count.The 5-year cumulative overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse rate and incidence of transplantation related mortality (TRM) were 59.9%, 59.2%, 10.5% and 31.8% during a median follow-up period of 24.4 (6.2-72.0) months. The OS and DFS of higher-risk group with IT, ST and lower-risk group were different (72.1% vs 16.7% vs 68.1%, P = 0.028; 72.1% vs 16.7% vs 67.9%, P = 0.030). And the OS and DFS of higher-risk group with IT were similar to those of lower-risk group (P = 0.526,0.504) . For the higher-risk group, the patients on IT had improved survival than those on ST in terms of OS and DFS (both P = 0.020). Moreover, the OS and DFS of remission group were higher than non-remission group in patients on IT (both 100% vs 46.7%, P = 0.049). The number of marrow blasts significantly decreased after IT (P = 0.010) without increased TRM (28.9% vs 33.6%, P = 0.612).Induction therapy prior to Allo-HSCT for MDS may reduce clone burden and improve the outcomes of higher-risk MDS without increased TRM.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405537","annotations":[{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.721843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.692131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.610813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.389381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.2352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"526","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/526"},{"name":"1723","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1723"},{"name":"272","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/272"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"TeleRadio-Moldova","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeleRadio-Moldova"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
