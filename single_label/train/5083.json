{"id":5083,"title":"Maintaining low transfusion and angioembolization rates in the age of nonoperative management of pediatric blunt splenic injury.","abstract":"Nonoperative management of hemodynamically stable blunt splenic injury (BSI) is the gold standard in children. Recent studies from nonpediatric surgery-specialized trauma centers have demonstrated a rise in transfusion and angioembolization associated with decreased splenectomy rates. We investigate the rate of splenectomy and nonsurgical interventions (angioembolization, blood transfusion) for BSI in a pediatric surgery-specialized trauma center. We conducted a retrospective review of children (0 to 18 years) treated between September 2001 and September 2011 at a children's hospital. Analyzed data included presenting vital signs, nadir hemoglobin, splenic injury grade, Revised Trauma Score, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). Measured outcomes included transfusion, angioembolization, and splenectomy rates. The study period was divided into three time periods to identify possible trends and compared with national averages. There were 180 patients, 91 with multiple injuries (50.6%) and 89 (49.4%) with isolated BSI. Seventy-six per cent of patients were male, average age was 12.8 years, and average ISS was 14.7. The overall splenectomy rate was 1.7 per cent (1.1% for isolated splenic injury). Our angioembolization rate was 0.6 per cent compared with 7.4 to 16 per cent nationally. Our transfusion rate was 14.4 per cent overall and 5.6 per cent for isolated splenic injury compared with 9.5 to 24.9 per cent nationally. Intervention rates remained unchanged over the study period. Splenectomy rates have remained low at our institution without an increase in angioembolization or transfusion. Children with splenic injuries treated at dedicated pediatric hospitals can be successfully managed nonoperatively without angioembolization or blood transfusion.
