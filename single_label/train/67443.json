{"id":67443,"title":"?-adrenergic blockers for the treatment of lower-urinary-tract symptoms and dysfunction in women.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ?-adrenergic blockers in the treatment of female lower-urinary-tract symptoms and dysfunction.Literature searches were conducted using EMBASE (1974 to January 2014), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to January 2014), and MEDLINE (1946 to January 2014) to identify clinical trials evaluating the effects of ?-adrenergic blockers in the treatment of women with lower-urinary-tract dysfunction. Bibliographies from relevant research articles were also reviewed for inclusion.All original research articles available in the English language were identified from the data sources. Primary literature evaluating outcomes related to urinary dysfunction and associated symptoms in women were included in this review. Articles describing the use of ?-adrenergic blockers in other medical conditions or in men were excluded.A total of 15 clinical studies were identified and evaluated. Many studies showed an improvement in female lower-urinary-tract symptoms and dysfunction using ?-adrenergic blockers. Most studies also reported adverse drug events of ?-adrenergic blockers such as dizziness and hypotension. However, limitations of the studies conducted to date include small sample sizes, inconsistent study designs, and short duration of therapy.The role of ?-adrenergic blockers in the treatment of urinary dysfunction and associated symptoms in women remains unclear. The majority of evidence suggests that these agents may have a place in therapy for female lower-urinary-tract symptoms and/or bladder outlet obstruction; however, data are conflicting. Clinicians should be aware of the potential clinical benefits but also recognize the potential adverse drug effects of ?-adrenergic blockers.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615630","annotations":[{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.782658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.706794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.602278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.532491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.263238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"1946","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Original research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_research"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
