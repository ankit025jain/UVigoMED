{"id":34265,"title":"Pure trisomy 2p syndrome in two siblings with an unbalanced translocation and minimal terminal 12q monosomy characterized by high-density microarray.","abstract":"Pure partial trisomy 2p patients have rarely been reported. Oligonucleotide array analysis has proved to be important for examining 2p rearrangements to delineate the involved segment and to rule out additional imbalances modifying the phenotype. Here, we report 2 siblings with an unbalanced translocation that led to a partial trisomy 2p (p22.3pter) and a terminal deletion of 12q (q24.33qter). This finding was characterized by the molecular karyotyping of both siblings. The 12q loss spanned approximately 300 kb and did not yield clinical features in our patients. The trisomic region in the short arm of chromosome 2 spanned 32.8 Mb and yielded phenotypic features of pure distal 2p trisomy, notably facial anomalies, growth failure, and psychomotor delay. The clinical features of our patients help to delineate the phenotype of the pure trisomy 2p syndrome. Patient 2 also showed a horseshoe kidney which is a previously unrecognized defect associated with this syndrome.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751616","annotations":[{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Chromosome 2 (human)","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_2_(human)"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Megabase","weight":0.788028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabase"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Monosomy","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosomy"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.629658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.45184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Growth failure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_failure"},{"name":"Horseshoe kidney","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_kidney"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"}]}
