{"id":45714,"title":"De novo duplication of 17p13.1-p13.2 in a patient with intellectual disability and obesity.","abstract":"17p13.1 Deletion encompassing TP53 has been described as a syndrome characterized by intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. Only one case with a 17p13.1 duplication encompassing TP53 has been reported in a patient with intellectual disability, seizures, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Here, we present a patient with a 17p13.1 duplication who exhibited obesity and intellectual disability, similar to the previous report. The 9-year-old proposita was referred for the evaluation of intellectual disability and obesity. She also exhibited insulin resistance and liver dysfunction. She had wide palpebral fissures, upturned nostrils, a long mandible, short and slender fingers, and skin hyperpigmentation. Array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) detected a 3.2 Mb duplication of 17p13.1-p13.2 encompassing TP53, FXR2, NLGN2, and SLC2A4, which encodes the insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) associated with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscle. We suggest that 17p13.1 duplication may represent a clinically recognizable condition characterized partially by a characteristic facial phenotype, developmental delay, and obesity.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668897","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin
