{"id":67968,"title":"Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy with prostaglandin E1 in high-risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.","abstract":"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an important complication in the use of iodinated contrast media. The present study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in prevention of CIN in patients with high-risk factors undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).The study group consisted of 163 patients who had undergone a coronary intervention procedure between January 1, 2012 and October 31, 2012. Study participants were randomly assigned to either the PGE1 group (82 patients) or the control group (81 patients). Patients in the PGE1 group received PGE1 intravenous infusion of 20 ng/kg/min for 6 h before and after the administration of contrast media. The control group received 0.9 % sodium chloride solution for routine hydration only. A nonionic, low-osmolality contrast agent was used in our laboratory at this time. Serum creatinine (Scr) values and estimated glomerular filtration rate were measured before and within 48 h of the administration of contrast agents. CIN was defined as an increase of ?0.5 mg/dL or ? a 25 % increase in Scr concentrations over baseline within 48 h of angiography.The amount of contrast agent administered was similar for the PGE1 and control groups (156 ± 63 vs. 161 ± 68 mL, P > 0.05). The incidence of CIN was lower in the PGE1 group than in the control group (3.7 vs. 11.1 %, P < 0.05). No serious adverse effects were observed.In patients with high-risk factors undergoing PCI, the use of PGE1 for prevention of CIN is safe and efficacious.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570327","annotations":[{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.712527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.626731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.615676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.607706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.59866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.518188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.513345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.480419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.379206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.314983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.301251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.174844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Iodinated contrast","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodinated_contrast"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.0385503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Serum creatinine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_creatinine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E1","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E1"}]}
