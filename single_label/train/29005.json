{"id":29005,"title":"Imaging of acquired metabolic and toxic disorders of the basal ganglia.","abstract":"Toxic and metabolic disorders affecting the basal ganglia are variable, common, and easily misinterpreted on neuroimaging studies. Integration of clinical information with imaging findings is key to helping referring physicians diagnose and treat the underlying ailment. This review aims to provide a systematic approach to both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings, their potential causes, and their clinical implications.
