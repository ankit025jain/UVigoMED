{"id":92667,"title":"A prospective study of pain control by a 2-step irradiance schedule during topical photodynamic therapy of nonmelanoma skin cancer.","abstract":"Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) for selected nonmelanoma skin cancer using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) has yielded high long-term complete response rates with very good cosmesis. Pain during light activation of the photosensitizer can be a serious adverse event. A 2-step irradiance protocol has previously been shown to minimize ALA-PDT pain.To determine the irradiance-dependent pain threshold for MAL-PDT, to adapt the 2-step protocol to a light-emitting diode (LED) light source, and assess clinical response.In this prospective study, 25 superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) received an initial irradiance by laser at 40 or 50 mW/cm², or LED at 35 mW/cm² followed by an irradiance at 70 mW/cm² for a total of 75 J/cm². Pain levels were recorded for both irradiance steps. Efficacy was assessed at 6, 12, or 24 months.Pain was mild in the 40/70 mW/cm² laser cohort. Three instances of irradiance-limiting pain occurred at 50/70 mW/cm². Pain was minimal in the 35/70 mW/cm² LED cohort. Clinical response rates were 80% in the 50/70 mW/cm² laser cohort and 90% in the 35/70 mW/cm² LED cohort.Topical PDT can be effectively delivered to sBCC with minimal treatment-related pain by a 2-step irradiance protocol.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393353","annotations":[{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Basal-cell carcinoma","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.692802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Aminolevulinic acid","weight":0.672811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminolevulinic_acid"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.652474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.646655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.558183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.547072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.411965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diode","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.0727563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Threshold of pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain"},{"name":"Photosensitizer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitizer"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"}]}
