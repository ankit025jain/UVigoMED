{"id":17962,"title":"Retracing the evolutionary path that led to flea-borne transmission of Yersinia pestis.","abstract":"Yersinia pestis is an arthropod-borne bacterial pathogen that evolved recently from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, an enteric pathogen transmitted via the fecal-oral route. This radical ecological transition can be attributed to a few discrete genetic changes from a still-extant recent ancestor, thus providing a tractable case study in pathogen evolution and emergence. Here, we determined the genetic and mechanistic basis of the evolutionary adaptation of Y. pestis to flea-borne transmission. Remarkably, only four minor changes in the bacterial progenitor, representing one gene gain and three gene losses, enabled transmission by flea vectors. All three loss-of-function mutations enhanced cyclic-di-GMP-mediated bacterial biofilm formation in the flea foregut, which greatly increased transmissibility. Our results suggest a step-wise evolutionary model in which Y. pestis emerged as a flea-borne clone, with each genetic change incrementally reinforcing the transmission cycle. The model conforms well to the ecological theory of adaptive radiation.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832452","annotations":[{"name":"Adaptive radiation","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_radiation"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Yersinia pestis","weight":0.825046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Flea","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.740286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Theoretical ecology","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_ecology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.662088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.569713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.444062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Sociocultural evolution","weight":0.310833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Foregut","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foregut"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Introduction to evolution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_evolution"},{"name":"Biogeochemical cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pseudotuberculosis"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Computational complexity theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory"},{"name":"Basic reproduction number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Yersinia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
