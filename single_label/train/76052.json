{"id":76052,"title":"[State of the energy-supply system of the liver mitochondria under the conditions of alimentary deficiency of protein].","abstract":"The NADH-dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activity of the rats' liver mitochondria under the conditions of alimentary deprivation of protein has been studied. Research was carried out on 65 white non-linear rats divided according to the diet protein content into three groups: 1--rats fed a hypoprotein diet (7% of protein, 10% of fat u 83% of carbohydrates; n = 26); 2--rats fed a protein-free diet (n = 26); 3--rats fed a complete semi-synthetic ration (14% of protein, 10% of fat u 76% of carbohydrates; n = 13). The NADH-dehydrogenase activity was estimated by spectrophotometric method, succinate dehydrogenase activity--by the intensity of reduction of the potassium ferricyanide. It has been estimated that the decrease of NADH-dehydrogenase activity of mitochondria occurred on the 14th day of feeding rats with protein-free diet, and four-week feeding of rats under these conditions lead to the decrease of enzyme activity by 5,5 fold compared with the control group (0.506 +/- 0.040 nmol NADH/min/mg of protein) and by 3,0 fold compared with the previous stage of the experiment. At the same time a hypoprotein diet caused 2-fold decrease of NADH-dehydrogenase activity of liver mitochondria only on the 28th day. It has been shown that the succinate dehydrogenase activity didn't change significantly after two-week maintenance of rats on a protein-free diet as compared with control, while the four-week maintenance on both hypoprotein and protein-free diet lead to the decrease of the succinate dehydrogenase activity. Specifically, under the conditions of the hypoprotein diet succinate dehydrogenase activity of liver mitochondria decreased twofold and under the conditions of the protein free diet-- threefold. Probably, the disorders at the level of Complex I of respiratory chain underlie the realization of the changes in the system of energy biotransformation in mitochondria under the conditions of alimentary protein deficiency.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300104","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Electron transport chain","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transport_chain"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.639484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.532301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.503812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.476891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Succinate dehydrogenase","weight":0.459059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.428011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.326489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Potassium ferricyanide","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_ferricyanide"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.126886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Semisynthesis","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semisynthesis"},{"name":"NADH dehydrogenase","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADH_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Ferricyanide","weight":0.0582433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferricyanide"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Biotransformation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotransformation"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Enzyme activity","weight":0.0264217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_activity"},{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Rationing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing"},{"name":"Sleep deprivation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"}]}
