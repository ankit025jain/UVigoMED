{"id":37938,"title":"When rare illuminates common: how cardiocutaneous syndromes transformed our perspective on arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"The classic cardiocutaneous syndromes of Naxos and Carvajal are rare. The myocardial disorder integral to their pathology - arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy - is arguably not uncommon, with a prevalence of up to 1 in 1,000 despite almost certain under-recognition. Yet the study of cardiocutaneous syndromes has been integral to evolution of the contemporary perspective of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy - its clinical course, disease spectrum, genetics, and cellular and molecular mechanisms. Here we discuss how recognition of the association of hair and skin abnormalities with underlying heart disease transformed our conception of a little-understood but important cause of sudden cardiac death.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460197","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.574279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.532167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.462738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.309291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.160012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"}]}
