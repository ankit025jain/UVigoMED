{"id":81858,"title":"Ulceration of the oral mucosa following direct contact with ferrous sulfate in elderly patients: a case report and a review of the French National Pharmacovigilance Database.","abstract":"To report a series of cases of ulceration of the oral mucosa linked to direct contact with ferrous sulfate in elderly patients.The first case report concerns the occurrence of widespread oral ulceration in an 87-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. The ulceration extended from the side of the tongue to the floor of the mouth. No clear explanation was found and various local treatments were ineffective. Once it was realized that the ferrous sulfate tablets (given as an iron supplement) were crushed prior to administration (due to the patient's deglutition disorder), withdrawal of this treatment led to rapid resolution of the ulceration. Nine other cases of oral ulcerations associated with ferrous sulfate were identified in the French National Pharmacovigilance Database. All but one of the patients were over 80 years of age and the youngest patient (a 54-year-old) had dysphagia associated with facial paralysis.Only two other reports of oral ulceration due to ferrous sulfate have been published to date. Mucosal toxicity of ferrous sulfate (which is probably related to oxidative stress) has previously been reported for the hypopharynx, the esophageal lumen, and (after inhalation of a tablet) the tracheobronchial tree.The mucosal toxicity of ferrous sulfate must be taken into account when deglutition disorders are present (as in elderly patients) and appropriate pharmaceutical formulations (such as syrups) should be administered to at-risk patients. The use of iron salts other than ferrous sulfate could be considered.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812499","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.815491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.754166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hypopharynx","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopharynx"},{"name":"Tracheobronchial tree","weight":0.335221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheobronchial_tree"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.324897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"},{"name":"Iron(II) sulfate","weight":0.288808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(II)_sulfate"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.276866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.225818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Salt (chemistry)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.158955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.154741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Ferrous","weight":0.0415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrous"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Syrup","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrup"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Iron(III) chloride","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_chloride"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Iron supplements","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_supplements"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"}]}
