{"id":53957,"title":"Cohort study of diabetes in HIV-infected adult patients: evaluating the effect of diabetes mellitus on immune reconstitution.","abstract":"We conducted a retrospective cohort study assessing the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and immune recovery in HIV-infected adults. Immune reconstitution after initiating antiretroviral therapy was more rapid in DM patients (120.4 cells/year) compared to non-DM patients (94.2 cells/year, p<0.023). Metformin use was associated with improved CD4 recovery (p=0.034).","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485344","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.677395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.462371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.148497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0297571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
