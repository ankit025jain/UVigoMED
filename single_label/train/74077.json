{"id":74077,"title":"Staurosporine induced apoptosis rapidly downregulates TDP- 43 in glioma cells.","abstract":"TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed DNA/RNA binding protein that has recently attracted attention for its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases. While TDP-43 has been found to participate in various important cellular activities including stress and apoptosis, little is known about its role in cancer cells. Here we report that staurosporine (STS) induced apoptosis in U87 glioma cells is associated with rapid downregulation of TDP-43 at both mRNA and protein levels. The latter is dependent on activation of caspase 3. More importantly, we have shown that knockdown of TDP-43 by specific siRNA dramatically enhanced cytotoxicity of STS. These results suggest that normal level of TDP-43 may be protective for cancer cells under apoptotic insult.
