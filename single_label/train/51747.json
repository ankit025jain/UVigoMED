{"id":51747,"title":"Effect of photodynamic therapy with hypocrellin B on apoptosis, adhesion, and migration of cancer cells.","abstract":"In the present study, we investigated effects of photodynamic therapy with hypocrellin B on apoptosis, adhesion, and migration of cancer cells in vitro.Human ovarian cancer HO-8910 cell as a cancer model cell was incubated with hypocrellin B at a concentration of 2.5 ?M for 5 h and irradiated by light from a light-emitting diodes (LED) source. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry with annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and nuclear staining 6 h after hypocrellin B photoirradiation. Cell adhesion was assessed using the 3-(4, 5-dimthylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay 4 h after photodynamic treatment. Cell migration was measured 48 h after photodynamic treatment.Flow cytometry with annexin V/PI staining showed that early apoptotic and late apoptotic (necrotic) rates following photodynamic therapy with hypocrellin B markedly increased to 16.40% and 24.67%, respectively. Nuclear staining found nuclear condensation and typical apoptotic body in the treated cells. The number of cell migration was significantly decreased to 183 ± 28 after photodynamic therapy with hypocrellin B (p < 0.01). Light irradiation alone and hypocrellin B alone had no significant effect on cell migration. The cell adhesion inhibitory rate due to photodynamic action of hypocrellin B was 53.2 ± 1.8%, significantly higher than 2.7 ± 2.1% of light treatment alone and 1.0 ± 0.4% of hypocrellin B treatment alone (p < 0.01).The findings demonstrated that photodynamic therapy with hypocrellin B remarkably induced apoptosis and inhibited adhesion and migration of cancer cells in vitro.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661233","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.799526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.777776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.711178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.576707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.574321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.423539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.284458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.209495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.186511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0703418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Iodide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide"},{"name":"Bromide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"},{"name":"Condensation","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation"}]}
