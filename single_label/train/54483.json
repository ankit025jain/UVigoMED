{"id":54483,"title":"Novel mutations in ATPase 8, ND1 and ND5 genes associated with peripheral neuropathy of diabetes.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D), being a complex, multi factorial metabolic disorder, its chronic complications development remains puzzled. In this case report, we describe four novel mutations in Cyt b, ATPase 8, ND1 and ND5 genes' synergistic activity as plausible factors for the secondary complications of a patient with chronic T2D.
