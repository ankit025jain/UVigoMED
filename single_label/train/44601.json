{"id":44601,"title":"Contamination risk for operators performing semi-closed HIPEC procedure using cisplatin.","abstract":"Aim of this study was to assess operators' safety while performing a semi-closed HIPEC procedure for peritoneal carcinomatosis using cisplatin drugs.Environmental air, theater personnel urine, operators' gloves and hand skin contamination were assessed during two non-consecutive working days. Six operating surgeons, two anesthesiologists and two theater nurses were included in the study. Glove samples were collected from the inner surface of the external glove and from the external surface of the inner glove from operating surgeons wearing a double pair of gloves. Personnel urine samples were collected before, after and 24Â h from the procedure.Air and urine samples permanently resulted below detectable levels for cisplatin presence on all the tested sources and sessions. Cisplatin contamination was detected on the inner surface of the external gloves and on the outer surface of the inner gloves, but in a lower concentration for the latter. Skin wipe samples were below detectable levels for platinum presence.The results suggest that two pairs of gloves are adequate to protect the skin from antiblastic drugs. No sign of direct contact or systemic absorption of drugs was ever detected from the inspected samples. Semi-closed HIPEC technique appears to be a safe procedure for operators.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726786","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.629021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.575506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.503154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.501043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.466895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Crust (geology)","weight":0.457256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.434864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.219076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.155164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.124839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Glove","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"},{"name":"Wipe (transition)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipe_(transition)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Pair skating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_skating"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
