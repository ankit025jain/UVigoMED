{"id":19408,"title":"Prediction of major antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in Singapore, USA and China using a limited set of gene targets.","abstract":"Antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae, can be conferred by a large number of different acquired resistance genes, although it appears that relatively few dominate. A previous survey of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from Sydney, Australia, revealed that a limited set of genes could reliably predict resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) and aminoglycosides. Here we tested E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with a cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and/or ceftazidime minimum inhibitory concentration of ? 2 ?g/mL from China and Singapore, with significantly higher resistance rates than Australia, as well as the USA. Few targets were needed to predict non-susceptibility to 3GCs (95/95; 100%) and gentamicin (47/51; 92%). The gene types detected here are consistent with previous surveys in similar countries with similar resistance rates, where the majority of 3GC resistance can be explained by blaCTX-M genes. This study identified a limited set of genes capable of predicting resistance to 3GC and aminoglycoside antibiotics and implies a restriction in the global resistance gene pool that can be exploited for diagnostic purposes.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721234","annotations":[{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.913299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Cefotaxime","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime"},{"name":"Aminoglycoside","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.852729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.843696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Ceftazidime","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime"},{"name":"Ceftriaxone","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.754219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.701759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"China","weight":0.640246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.439257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.343097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gene pool","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_pool"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.235491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Sydney","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"}]}
