{"id":47047,"title":"Prognostic value of muscle atrophy in cirrhosis using psoas muscle thickness on computed tomography.","abstract":"Waiting-list mortality in patients with cirrhosis and a relatively low MELD score is a matter of concern. The aim of this study was to determine whether a marker of muscle waste could improve prognostication.A pre-MELD cohort (waiting time-based allocation; n=186) and a MELD-era cohort (n=376) were examined. At evaluation, transversal psoas muscle thickness (TPMT) was measured on a computed tomography (CT) image at the level of the umbilicus. In the pre-MELD cohort, TPMT/height (mm/m) and the MELD score were entered in univariate and multivariate models to predict mortality after registration. Applicability of pre-MELD findings was tested in the MELD-era.In the pre-MELD cohort, the MELD score and TPMT/height were significantly associated with mortality. The discrimination of a score combining MELD and TPMT/height (MELD-psoas) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.62-0.95). In the MELD-era, TPTM/height was significantly associated with mortality, independent of the MELD and MELD-Na scores. There was a 15% increase in mortality risk per unit decrease in TPMT/height. The discrimination of MELD-psoas score (0.82; 95% CI, 0.64-0.93) was superior to that of the MELD score and similar to that of the MELD-Na score. In patients with refractory ascites, mortality was significantly higher when TPMT/height was <16.8 mm/m (42% vs. 9%, p=0.02).TPMP/height on CT at the level of the umbilicus, an objective marker of muscle waste, may be predictive of mortality in cirrhotic patients, independent of the MELD and MELD-Na scores. It may help to better assess the prognosis of patients with refractory ascites.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607622","annotations":[{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.835475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.552934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.515061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.239644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.155994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Muscle atrophy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_atrophy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Navel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel"},{"name":"Psoas major muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoas_major_muscle"},{"name":"Thiopurine methyltransferase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiopurine_methyltransferase"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Divination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"640","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/640"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Transversal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversal"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
