{"id":85533,"title":"[Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for intrathoracic extramedullary hematopoiesis].","abstract":"Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is associated with hematopoietic disorders, with intrathoracic EMH being a rare presentation. We report a case of posterior mediastinal EMH masses in 63-year-old male with congenital hemolytic anemia. Multiple paravertebral masses with dense soft parts and well defined borders, but without accompanying calcification or bone erosion were identified on a chest computed tomography (CT) scan during an examination for another disease. A left-posterior mediastinal mass was resected using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Post-operative pathological examination showed that the tumor was covered completely by a capsule, and composed of mature adipose tissue and hematopoietic tissue including erythroblasts and myeloid cells. Based on these findings we diagnosed intrathoracic EMH.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917163","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hemolytic anemia","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolytic_anemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.780388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.530327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Mediastinal tumor","weight":0.329973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinal_tumor"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.325994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.322769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Extramedullary hematopoiesis","weight":0.282569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extramedullary_hematopoiesis"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.270796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.148808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Normoblast","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normoblast"}]}
