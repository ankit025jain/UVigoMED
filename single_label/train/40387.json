{"id":40387,"title":"[Reverse effect of Yinchenhao decoction in dimethyl nitrosamine-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats].","abstract":"To discuss the reverse effect of Yinchenhao decoction(YCHD) in dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN)-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats.The rat hepatic fibrosis model was established through the intraperitoneal injection with 1% dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN) with a dose of 1.0 mL x kg(-1) x d(-1) for consecutively three weeks, once for the first three days of each. The rats were randomly divided into six groups: the silymarin positive control group (50.0 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), YCHD high (20.0 g x kg(-1) d(-1)), middle (8.0 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and low (3.2 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) dose groups, the model group and the normal control group. The model group and the normal control group were orally administered with normal saline for consecutively five weeks. The pathologic changes in liver tissues were observed by HE staining. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), g-glutamyltransferase (g-GGT), hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), collagen type IV (CIV) and type III procollagen amino terminal peptide (PIIINP) in serum were determined. The metabolite profiling of amino acid and the content of hydroxyproline in liver tissues were also measured.Compared with the model group, YCHD high and middle dose groups could significantly reverse the pathologic changes in liver tissues of rats. YCHD could reduce the levels of ALT, AST, gamma-GGT, HA, LN, CIV, PIIINP in serum and the content of hydroxyproline in liver tissues in a dose-dependent manner, and altered the metabolite profiling of amino acid in rat liver tissues.YCHD has the effect in reversing dimethyl nitrosamine induced hepatic fibrosis in rats.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System
