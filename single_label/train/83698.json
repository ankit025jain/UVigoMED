Practical guidelines and the authors' data].","abstract":"The paper describes the technical features of a transradial approach; indications and patient selection for this arterial approach; and stepwise patient preparation. It depicts the anatomic variants of the origin of the radial artery, which affect the success of this approach. The suitable instruments for this approach are described. The authors give their results of the performed study comparing different types of approaches.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272724","annotations":[{"name":"Radial artery","weight":0.817213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_artery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.371877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.137394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Radius (bone)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"}]}
