{"id":23559,"title":"Human isolates of Listeria monocytogenes in Sweden during half a century (1958-2010).","abstract":"Isolates of Listeria monocytogenes (n = 932) isolated in Sweden during 1958-2010 from human patients with invasive listeriosis were characterized by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (AscI). Of the 932 isolates, 183 different PFGE types were identified, of which 83 were each represented by only one isolate. In all, 483 serovar 1/2a isolates were distributed over 114 PFGE types; 90 serovar 1/2b isolates gave 32 PFGE types; 21 serovar 1/2c isolates gave nine PFGE types; three serovar 3b isolates gave one PFGE type; and, 335 serovar 4b isolates gave 31 PFGE types. During the 1980s in Sweden, several serovar 4b cases were associated with the consumption of European raw soft cheese. However, as cheese-production hygiene has improved, the number of 4b cases has decreased. Since 1996, serovar 1/2a has been the dominant L. monocytogenes serovar in human listeriosis in Sweden. Therefore, based on current serovars and PFGE types, an association between human cases of listeriosis and the consumption of vacuum-packed gravad and cold-smoked salmon is suggested.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480252","annotations":[{"name":"Human","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Cheese","weight":0.436492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese"},{"name":"Listeriosis","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeriosis"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.340579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.241305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.150106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Listeria monocytogenes","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Salmon","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"1980","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980"},{"name":"335","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/335"},{"name":"932","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/932"},{"name":"Shilling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"British Board of Film Classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"}]}
