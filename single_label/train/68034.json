{"id":68034,"title":"The economics of abiraterone acetate for castration-resistant prostate cancer.","abstract":"Abiraterone acetate is an oral medication that has recently been granted approval for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) prior and/or after chemotherapy with docetaxel. In this article we assess the economics of abiraterone acetate in mCRPC. Relevant studies demonstrated that abiraterone acetate had a minimal budget impact on health plans. A relevant advantage was the cost savings due to the lack of chemotherapy-related side effects as well as the ease of administration. The results of cost/benefit comparative studies with other novel agents (i.e. cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, sipuleucel-T) are warranted as well as the close collaboration between urologists and medical oncologists.
