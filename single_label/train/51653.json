{"id":51653,"title":"[Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes and autoimmune encephalitis].","abstract":"Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are defined as remote effects on the central and peripheral nervous system that are not caused directly by the tumor, its metastases and treatment, or metabolic disorders. The most probable cause is a falsely initiated immune reaction. Well-defined classical PNSs are associated with distinct tumors and occur with onconeural antibodies directed against intracellular neuronal antigens. However, response to therapy is limited. Recently, new antibodies directed against neuronal surface antigens were described in encephalitic syndromes of autoimmune origin. These probably antibody-mediated disorders are more frequent than classical PNS, occur with or without tumor association and often show a good response to immunosuppressive treatment.
