{"id":9476,"title":"Identification of lymphocystis disease virus from paradise fish Macropodus opercularis (LCDV-PF).","abstract":"Iridoviruses are large DNA viruses that are subdivided into five genera: Ranavirus, Megalocytivirus, Lymphocystivirus, Chloriridovirus and Iridovirus. The iridovirus lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) is an important fish pathogen that can infect marine and freshwater fish worldwide. In this study, we have identified the pathogen in paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis) with lymphocystis. On the skin and fins of diseased paradise fish, a large number of nodules were observed. H&E staining showed that the nodules were composed of encapsulated hypertrophied cells. Using electron microscopy, numerous virus particles with a diameter of >210 nm and with hexagonal profiles were observed in the cytoplasm. Phylogenetic analysis based on the major capsid protein (MCP), DNA polymerase and myristylated membrane protein (MMP) genes revealed that LCDV from paradise fish (LCDV-PF) was closely related to lymphocystis disease virus from China (LCDV-C), followed by lymphocystis disease virus 1 (LCDV-1). Taken together, our data provide the first molecular evidence that, in addition to megalocytivirus, LCDV is an important iridoviral pathogen in paradise fish besides megalocytivirus.
