{"id":62995,"title":"[Evaluate activating blood circulation and dissipating blood stasis effect mechanism of foshousan on acute blood stasis rats on basis of metabolomic approach].","abstract":"Ice water bath and subcutaneous injection of adrenaline were used to establish the acute blood stasis model of rats. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to study the urine metabolic changes of acute blood stasis rats. Potential biomarkers were selected by variable importance projection, and identified on basis of MS information and databases. The metabolic pathways were predicted via MetPA database. To study the effect of Foshousan on endogenous metabolites of acute blood stasis model rats, find potential biomarkers, and explore the effect mechanism of Foshousan on activating blood circulation and dissipating blood stasis. Eleven potential biomarkers were identified with multivariate statistical analysis of urine metabolite profiles, and which also were used to explain the phenylalanine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism. Those disturbed metabolic pathways in acute blood stasis rats could be regulated closely to normal state after Foshousan administration. Metabolomics has a bright prospect in the efficacy evaluation and effect mechanism elucidation of the traditional Chinese medicines.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490576","annotations":[{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Phenylalanine","weight":0.798537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine"},{"name":"Metabolomics","weight":0.797508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.543309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.541726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.538274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.447037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Sphingolipid","weight":0.0752563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingolipid"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Ice","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Marketing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
