{"id":82664,"title":"\"Training teeth\": transitional resin bonding for diagnostic purposes.","abstract":"Despite the best diagnostic efforts, the etiology of a patient's dental disease may remain elusive. Without knowing the underlying disease factors, predictable outcomes are difficult to obtain. This case report describes the diagnosis and treatment of a patient who felt embarrassed by the appearance of his smile and was desperately seeking a solution. Despite meticulous data collection and a systematic diagnostic approach, the disease etiology could not be determined. It was, therefore, decided to treat the patient with non-invasive transitional directly bonded composite to road test his new teeth. In this way, a determination could be made as to whether they would function successfully over time.
