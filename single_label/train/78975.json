{"id":78975,"title":"[Quality of voice and life after injectionlaryngoplasty using VOX Implants(Â®) (polydimethylsiloxane)].","abstract":"Within the last years the injection laryngoplasty is a common method in treating patients with a unilateral vocal cord paralysis. The augmentation with VOX-Implants is an option for a permanent treatment. The aim was to evaluate the quality of voice as well as the quality of life in this patients and especially if it is comparable to other methods.We analyzed prospectively 20 patients who underwent injection laryngoplasty with VOX-Implants in general anesthesia. To verify the glottic closure we examined each patient pre- and postoperative using the rigid stroboscope and the flexible videoendoscope. To measure the voice related quality of life the voice handicap index (VHI-12) had to be answered. Maximum phonation time, RBH-Scale, Voice-Range, \"Goettinger hoarsness diagram\" (GHD) and the \"Friedrich's Dysphonia Index\" (FDI) were examined to investigate the quality of voice.The VHI-12 decreased from 30.4 pts. to 13.6 pts. The maximum phonation time was 6.45 s before and 13.95 s after the operation. The RBH-Scale the was lowered form 2.5 preoperative to 1.1 postoperative. The voice range increased 3.5 semi tones. Concerning the GHD the irregularity increased as well as the noise factor (1.79 pts., respective 0.86 pts.). The FDI declined 1.1 pts.Using VOX-Implants is a useful material to better the quality of life. The injection laryngoplasty with polydimethylsiloxane improves considerably the quality of voice. No complication concerning the material itself could be seen within 6 months. The results are comparable to other techniques (e.g. Thyroplasty). The decision of which material or which technique is to use must be an individual one.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519317","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.898354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Phonation","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Vocal cord paresis","weight":0.731761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_cord_paresis"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.590898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.471989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Vocal range","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_range"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Noise figure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_figure"},{"name":"Polydimethylsiloxane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydimethylsiloxane"},{"name":"Vhi Healthcare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vhi_Healthcare"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"VOX (TV channel)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOX_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Stroboscope","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscope"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Pitch (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Diagram","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Kurt O.
