{"id":36809,"title":"[Analysis of fragile X mental retardation 1 gene premutation in multiple system atrophy patients].","abstract":"To investigate whether Chinese multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients have premutation of fragile X mental retardation 1 gene(FMR1).FMR1 CGG repeats were analyzed in 157 MSA patients by polymerase chain reaction, agarose gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis. The patients were collected from Movement Disorder & Neurogenetics Research Center of China-Japan friendship hospital. There were 83 male cases and 74 female cases, including 51 MSA-C patients, 12 MSA-P patients and 94 MSA-P+C patients.No FMR1 CGG repeat premutation was detected in 157 MSA patients. The repeats ranged from 11-49, most common allele was 22. A MSA-C case carried 35/49 alleles did not have middle cerebellar peduncles(MCP) sign which was necessary for the diagnosis of fragile X associated tremor ataxia syndrome(FXTAS).The FMR1 premutation in Chinese MSA patients might be very rare.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548388","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.865113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.693193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.676505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.548886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Capillary electrophoresis","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Agarose gel electrophoresis","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarose_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Tremor","weight":0.302928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremor"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Fragile X syndrome","weight":0.240104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.134165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Multiple system atrophy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_system_atrophy"},{"name":"FMR1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMR1"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"1149","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1149"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Disorder (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(band)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Sports_and_Aquatic_Centre"},{"name":"Friendship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship"},{"name":"Neurogenetics","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenetics"}]}
