{"id":81836,"title":"Inflammatory paradental cyst of the first molar (buccal bifurcation cyst) in a 6-year-old boy: case report with respect to immunohistochemical findings.","abstract":"The inflammatory paradental cyst (IPC) is a relatively rarely reported lesion arising from the lateral periodontium of vital teeth. However, IPC appear to be under-represented in registers of odontogenic cysts due to the misinterpretation of IPC as infected dentigerous cysts, in particular IPC originating from third molars. IPCs exhibit some temporospatial associations with tooth eruptions and occur almost exclusively in the mandible. The IPC of the first molar is predominantly diagnosed in children younger than 10 years. Bony bulging in the area of cyst formation may alert parents to seek medical advice. This case report details the characteristic clinical and radiological features of a first molar IPC arising in a child. The features of the presented cyst correspond well to the attributes qualifying for a so-called buccal bifurcation cyst. A conservative treatment regimen proved to be successful. Certain immunohistochemical markers are reported to further characterize this entirely benign lesion.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815835","annotations":[{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Paradental cyst","weight":0.757699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradental_cyst"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Wisdom tooth","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_tooth"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.682796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Buccal bifurcation cyst","weight":0.589637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buccal_bifurcation_cyst"},{"name":"Odontogenic cyst","weight":0.582351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic_cyst"},{"name":"Odontogenic","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.459177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.342427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.202265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Volcano","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Processor register","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Eye examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_examination"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
