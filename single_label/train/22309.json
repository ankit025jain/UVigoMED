{"id":22309,"title":"Escherichia coli bacteraemia in adults: age-related differences in clinical and bacteriological characteristics, and outcome.","abstract":"To explore the specificities of Escherichia coli bacteraemia in the elderly, the demographic, clinical and bacteriological characteristics and in-hospital mortality rate of 'young' (18-64 years, n = 395), 'old' (65-79 years, n = 372) and 'very old' (?80 years, n = 284) adult patients of the multicentre COLIBAFI cohort study were compared. Clinical and bacteriological risk factors for death were jointly identified by logistic regression and multivariate analysis within each group. 'Young' and 'old' patients had more comorbidities than 'very old' patients (comorbidity score: 1·5 ± 1·3 and 1·6 ± 1·2 vs. 1·2 ± 1·2, respectively; P < 0·001), and were more frequently nosocomially infected (22·3% and 23·8% vs. 8·8%, respectively; P < 0·001). 'Old' patients had the poorest prognosis (death rate: 16·4% vs.10·4% for 'young' and 12·0% for 'very old' patients, respectively; P = 0·039). Risk factors for death were age group-specific, suggesting a host-pathogen relationship evolving with age.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559489","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.69057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.675724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.562499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.543451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.419828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.304374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.198984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1864","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1864"},{"name":"395","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/395"},{"name":"284","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/284"},{"name":"238","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/238"},{"name":"372","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
