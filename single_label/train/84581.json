{"id":84581,"title":"Possible progression of subacute lupus erythematosus--case report.","abstract":"Subacute lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a specific form of lupus erythematosus characterized by prevalently cutaneous manifestations usually with a good prognosis. It is more common in patients aged 15 to 70 years, and there is a female predilection. This form accounts for 10% of all lupus erythematosus cases. We present the case of a 57-year-old male patient diagnosed at age 35 with chronic psoriasiform subacute lupus erythematosus, pathologically confirmed at the Ia?i Dermatology Clinic. At the age of 54 years he had multiple ischemic strokes, followed by deterioration of general status, and at 56 years deep vein thrombosis in the right leg. The patient presented the erythematous-squamous lesions specific to psoriasiform SLE localized both on the upper third of the body and knees and associated with submucosal lesions of the lower lip, oral mucosa and appendages. The patient also presented hypo- and hyperpigmentated atrophic scar-like lesions. Laboratory tests performed during the last two admissions showed the presence of anti-ds DNA and antiphospholipid antibodies, inflammatory syndrome, and nitrogen retention syndrome. Treatment consisted of systemic and local dermatocorticoids and associated medication, emollient lotions and creams with SPF 50+, with slowly favorable progression. The peculiarity of the case lies in the chronic progression without significant systemic involvement for 19 years, and then in 2 years the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and a shift to systemic lupus erythematosus to occur.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076704","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Moisturizer","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.61709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.59486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.584428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","weight":0.457165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.340999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.335132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.323784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Cream (pharmaceutical)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(pharmaceutical)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sunscreen","weight":0.0250317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Lotion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotion"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Skin appendage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_appendage"}]}
