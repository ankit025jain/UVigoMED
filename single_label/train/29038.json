{"id":29038,"title":"[Pathological gambling and addiction to cannabis: common psychosocial profile?].","abstract":"Addiction can involve substances (heroin, cannabis, cocaine) or be characterised by behaviour (pathological gambling, addiction to sport, etc.). The question is to establish whether or not there is a specific personality profile (character, temperament) and emotional functioning (anxiety, depression, alexithymia) in subjects presenting addictive behaviour with and without substance use. To find some answers, a team from Sainte-Marguerite General Hospital in Marseille carried out a study comparing a group of cannabis addicts and a group of pathological gamblers.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741830","annotations":[{"name":"Problem gambling","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.795373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Gambling","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.724806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Behavioral addiction","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_addiction"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.597755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.432483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.311587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Alexithymia","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.1416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Temperament","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperament"},{"name":"Marseille","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"}]}
