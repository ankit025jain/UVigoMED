{"id":76943,"title":"A comparative controlled trial comparing the effects of yoga and walking for overweight and obese adults.","abstract":"Walking and yoga have been independently evaluated for weight control; however, there are very few studies comparing the 2 with randomization.The present study compared the effects of 90 minutes/day for 15 days of supervised yoga or supervised walking on: (i) related biochemistry, (ii) anthropometric variables, (iii) body composition, (iv) postural stability, and (v) bilateral hand grip strength in overweight and obese persons. Sixty-eight participants, of whom 5 were overweight (BMI ?25 kg/m2) and 63 were obese (BMI ?30 kg/m2; group mean age ±S.D., 36.4±11.2 years; 35 females), were randomized as 2 groups - (i) a yoga group and (ii) a walking group - given the same diet.All differences were pre-post changes within each group. Both groups showed a significant (p<0.05; repeated measures ANOVA, post-hoc analyses) decrease in: BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, lean mass, body water, and total cholesterol. The yoga group increased serum leptin (p<0.01) and decreased LDL cholesterol (p<0.05). The walking group decreased serum adiponectin (p<0.05) and triglycerides (p<0.05).Both yoga and walking improved anthropometric variables and serum lipid profile in overweight and obese persons. The possible implications are discussed.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878827","annotations":[{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.849146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.829491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.702384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.599137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.561665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.561523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Yoga","weight":0.490493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Body water","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_water"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Weight control","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_control"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Standing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Grip strength","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_strength"}]}
