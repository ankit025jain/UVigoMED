{"id":88367,"title":"Evidence gaps in the global decade of road traffic safety.","abstract":"Road traffic accidents are a leading cause of global mortality. In March 2010, the United Nations General Assembly and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially proclaimed 2011-2020 as the \"Decade of Action for Road Safety.\" Researchers must focus on vulnerable road users and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and should give preference to simple high-impact interventions likely to be inexpensive and widely applicable. Collaborative investigative networks should include LMICs, and economic evaluations should demonstrate the value of novel interventions in LMIC settings. Reliable data systems are essential to understand needs and outcomes, and knowledge translation studies should support effective implementation.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857990","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Road traffic safety","weight":0.897852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety"},{"name":"United Nations","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.666255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.551772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.545484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.538591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.537023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"United Nations General Assembly","weight":0.525314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.43624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.348154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.229115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Investigative journalism","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Translation studies","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_studies"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"California State Assembly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Interventionism (politics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventionism_(politics)"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Data system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_system"}]}
