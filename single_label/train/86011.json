{"id":86011,"title":"[The speed CT measurement of the airway in obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome].","abstract":"To measure the upper airway of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome by speed CT. We can predict the airway obstruction plane with the airway plane data and compliance in OSAHS patients. Through this measurement, we can provide assistance for clinical diagnosis and treatment.This study randomly selected 82 patients diagnosed with OSAHS and 45 cases non-snoring healthy people as control group by the PHILIPS 256-slice CT. The zone volume, sagittal diameter, coronary diameter and cross-sectional area of the narrowest plane in nasopharyngeal area, velopharyngeal area, glossopharyngeal area, hypopharynx area in two groups of quiet respiration and M端ller's status were measured.In the OSAHS group underwent quiet breathing and M端ller movement during CT scanning, the two states about nasopharyngeal coronary diameter, the hypopharynx sagittal diameter and cross-sectional area showed no significant difference, while other groups showed differences between the parameters (P<0.05). There was significant difference (P<0.01) in the velopharyngeal volume, tongue sagittal diameter and volume. Under M端ller movement in the OSAHS group and the control group, the hypopharynx volume showed no significant difference. The nasopharyngeal coronary diameter and volume, velopharyngeal cross-sectional area and tongue sagittal diameter were different (P<0.05). The remaining set of parameters showed significant differences (P<0.01). Compared the airway compliance (M端ller phase) of the OSAHS group and the control group,the parameters of each group were different (P<0.05), of which the nasopharyngeal sagittal diameter, velopharyngeal volume showed significant difference (P<0.01). Meanwhile, in the same plane, coronary diameter was greater than sagittal diameter (P<0.05) in both the OSAHS group and the control group. The pharyngeal volume measurement was basically consistent to the fiber endoscopy.The obstruction plate of OSAHS patients is mostly in the velopharyngeal area and glossopharyngeal area measured with a high speed CT. The volume measurement of upper airway with speed CT can predict airway obstruction plate in patients with OSAHS.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826446","annotations":[{"name":"Respiration (physiology)","weight":0.858534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Hypopharynx","weight":0.674475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopharynx"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.531935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.385158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Airway obstruction","weight":0.327954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Glossopharyngeal nerve","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossopharyngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Philips","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Fixed-wing aircraft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
