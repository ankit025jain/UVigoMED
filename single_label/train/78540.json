{"id":78540,"title":"Cytokine profiles in allergic rhinitis.","abstract":"Allergic rhinitis, particularly seasonal allergic rhinitis, is considered a classic Th2-mediated disease, with important contributions to pathology by interleukins 4, 5 and 13. As such, allergic rhinitis is an excellent model for studying allergic inflammation, with findings potentially relevant to the mechanism of lower airways inflammation seen in allergic asthma. However, recent evidence has revealed roles for additional non-Th2 cytokines in asthma, including IL-17 family cytokines and epithelial-derived cytokines. Additionally, putative roles for epithelial-derived cytokines and innate lymphoid cells have been described in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Here, evidence for the involvement of different cytokines and cytokine groups in allergic rhinitis is considered.
