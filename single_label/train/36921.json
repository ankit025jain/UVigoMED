{"id":36921,"title":"Novel mitofusin 2 splice-site mutation causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 with prominent sensory dysfunction.","abstract":"MFN2 mutations are a major cause of the axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2). MFN2 encodes mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial fusion protein that is critical for mitochondrial DNA integrity and function. Here we describe CMT2 in a Finnish man and his son, with disease onset in young adulthood, slow progression, and prominent sensory as well as autonomic dysfunction. Molecular analysis revealed in both subjects a previously unreported heterozygous MFN2 mutation c.708G>A that is predicted to abolish a donor splice site for exon 7 of the MFN2 gene. An incorrectly spliced transcript without exon 7 was detected in RT-PCR analysis. The lack of exon 7 creates frameshift and, consequently, premature termination within exon 8. We demonstrated the presence of the aberrant mRNA suggesting either dominant-negative or toxic gain-of-function effect of the heterozygous c.708G>A mutation. This novel mutation adds to the few previously reported pathogenic MFN2 splice site mutations causing CMT2.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530046","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.820517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Mitochondrial DNA","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.794376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.361534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.291533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Dysautonomia","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia"},{"name":"Translational frameshift","weight":0.226006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_frameshift"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.138079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Terminator (genetics)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
