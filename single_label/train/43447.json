{"id":43447,"title":"An integrative analysis of colon cancer identifies an essential function for PRPF6 in tumor growth.","abstract":"The spliceosome machinery is composed of multimeric protein complexes that generate a diverse repertoire of mRNA through coordinated splicing of heteronuclear RNAs. While somatic mutations in spliceosome components have been discovered in several cancer types, the molecular bases and consequences of spliceosome aberrations in cancer are poorly understood. Here we report for the first time that PRPF6, a member of the tri-snRNP (small ribonucleoprotein) spliceosome complex, drives cancer proliferation by preferential splicing of genes associated with growth regulation. Inhibition of PRPF6 and other tri-snRNP complex proteins, but not other snRNP spliceosome complexes, selectively abrogated growth in cancer cells with high tri-snRNP levels. High-resolution transcriptome analyses revealed that reduced PRPF6 alters the constitutive and alternative splicing of a discrete number of genes, including an oncogenic isoform of the ZAK kinase. These findings implicate an essential role for PRPF6 in cancer via splicing of distinct growth-related gene products.
