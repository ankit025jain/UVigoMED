{"id":75490,"title":"[The role of standardization of the spa and resort-based treatment of the patients based at a neurological health resort].","abstract":"The present paper was designed to summarize the experience with the standard use of the spa and resort-based treatment of the patients with the lesions in separate nerves, nerve roots and plexuses as well as polyneuropathies. It was shown that the existing standard helps to resolve certain marketing problems but is not sufficiently adequate for the choice of the set of therapeutic modalities on an individual basis. The importance of the correct choice of the combination of the methods for the treatment of neurological disorders and the achievement of the desired outcome of the disease is emphasized. The prognostically significant predictors of the effectiveness of the spa and resort-based treatment have been identified.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087416","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.74471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Nerve root","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_root"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.139751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Marketing","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"},{"name":"Resort","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plexus"},{"name":"Stimulus modality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_modality"},{"name":"Destination spa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destination_spa"},{"name":"Spa","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa"}]}
