{"id":19144,"title":"Acquisition of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae by healthy travellers to India, France, February 2012 to March 2013.","abstract":"Healthy travellers to countries where carbapenemases-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are endemic might be at risk for their acquisition, even without contact with the local healthcare system. Here, we report the acquisition of CPE (two OXA-181, one New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)) in three healthy travellers returning from India. The duration of CPE intestinal carriage was less than one month. The results indicate that healthy travellers recently returning from India might be considered as at risk for CPE carriage.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739981","annotations":[{"name":"France","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"New Delhi","weight":0.5505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi"},{"name":"Delhi","weight":0.477368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi"},{"name":"India","weight":0.368737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"},{"name":"Ibanez Talman","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez_Talman"}]}
