{"id":46773,"title":"Temsirolimus and chloroquine cooperatively exhibit a potent antitumor effect against colorectal cancer cells.","abstract":"Temsirolimus (TEM) is a novel, water-soluble mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that has shown activity against a wide range of cancers in preclinical models, but its efficacy against colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been fully explored.We evaluated the antitumor effect of TEM in CRC cell lines (CaR-1, HT-29, Colon26) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, cell growth inhibition was assessed using a MTS assay. Apoptosis induction and cell cycle effects were measured using flow cytometry. Modulation of mTOR signaling was measured using immunoblotting. Antitumor activity as a single agent was evaluated in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model of CRC. The effects of adding chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, to TEM were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.In vitro, TEM was effective in inhibiting the growth of two CRC cell lines with highly activated AKT, possibly through the induction of G1 cell cycle arrest via a reduction in cyclin D1 expression, whereas TEM reduced HIF-1? and VEGF in all three cell lines. In a mouse subcutaneous tumor model, TEM inhibited the growth of tumors in all cell lines, not only through direct growth inhibition but also via an anti-angiogenic effect. We also explored the effects of adding chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, to TEM. Chloroquine significantly potentiated the antitumor activity of TEM in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the combination therapy triggered enhanced apoptosis, which corresponded to an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.Based on these data, we propose TEM with or without chloroquine as a new treatment option for CRC.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619662","annotations":[{"name":"Western
