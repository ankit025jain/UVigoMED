{"id":71948,"title":"A new X-ray activated nanoparticle photosensitizer for cancer treatment.","abstract":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted ever-growing attention as a promising modality in the treatment of cancer. However, due to the poor tissue penetration by light, PDT has rarely been applied for treating deep-seated tumors. This problem can be solved if photosensitizers are activated by X-rays, which are able to penetrate deeply into tissues. Previous attempts using X-rays to activate photosensitizers were not very successful, since the traditional PDT photosensitizers could not efficiently be activated with X-rays. Here we exploit copper-cysteamine complex (Cu-Cy) nanoparticles as a new type of photosensitizer activated by X-ray for cancer treatment. The newly invented Cu-Cy nanoparticles can be activated directly by X-rays to produce singlet oxygen. In vitro and in vivo study on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) have shown significant cell destruction using Cu-Cy nanoparticles under X-ray activation. The Cu-Cy nanoparticles are a novel and potent X-ray activated photosensitizer which can enable PDT for deep cancer treatment.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016650","annotations":[{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Singlet oxygen","weight":0.884597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlet_oxygen"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.534501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.389101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.292516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.244683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Photosensitizer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitizer"},{"name":"Photoelectrochemical processes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectrochemical_processes"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"}]}
