{"id":85434,"title":"From neuraminidase inhibitors to conjugates: a step towards better anti-influenza drugs?","abstract":"For the treatment of seasonal flu and possible pandemic infections the development of new anti-influenza drugs that have good bioavailability against a broad spectrum of influenza viruses including the resistant strains is needed. In this review, we summarize previous methods for the structural modification of zanamivir, a potent neuraminidase inhibitor that has rare drug resistance, in order to develop effective anti-influenza drugs. We also report recent research into the design of multivalent zanamivir drugs and bifunctional zanamivir conjugates, some of which have shown better efficacy in animal experiments. As a step towards developing improved antivirals, conjugating anti-influenza drugs with anti-inflammatory agents can improve oral bioavailability and also exert synergistic effect in influenza therapy.
