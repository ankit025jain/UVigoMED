{"id":43825,"title":"A preliminary evaluation of the TOPAS system for the treatment of fecal incontinence in women.","abstract":"The TOPAS AMS pelvic floor repair system is a self-fixating polypropylene mesh intended for use to reinforce soft tissues where weakness exists in the gynecological and gastroenterological anatomy. It is not available commercially in any country. This was a preliminary study conducted to obtain initial clinical experience with the TOPAS system for the treatment of fecal incontinence (FI) in women.This was a prospective study conducted at 5 centers in the United States. Women with FI who failed 1 or more conservative therapies were candidates for the study. Fecal incontinence was assessed with a bowel diary, Cleveland Clinic incontinence scores (CCISs), and Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQOL) questionnaires, and patients were followed prospectively up to 24 months. Treatment success was defined as a reduction in number of FI episodes of 50% or more compared with baseline.A total of 29 women (mean age, 60.6 years) were implanted with the TOPAS system. Mean number of FI episodes per 14 days decreased from 6.9 at baseline to 3.5 at 24 months of follow-up, and the reduction was significant for the entire follow-up period compared with baseline (P < 0.001). A total of 55.6% of the subjects reported treatment success. The CCIS and FIQOL scores for all domains were significantly improved during the overall follow-up period compared with baseline (P < 0.001). The most common procedure and/or device-related adverse events were de novo urinary incontinence, including bladder spasms (n = 6), worsening FI (n = 2), and constipation (n = 2). No device-related erosions or extrusions were reported.Initial experience of the TOPAS system demonstrated a significant improvement in FI episodes, CCIS and FIQOL scores, and a benign safety profile. These results indicate that the TOPAS system has potential as a new therapeutic option for FI, but it needs to be confirmed in a larger study.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763157","annotations":[{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cleveland Clinic","weight":0.775405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Pelvic floor","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_floor"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.472724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.394432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.20368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Cleveland","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland"},{"name":"Life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
