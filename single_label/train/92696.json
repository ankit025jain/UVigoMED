{"id":92696,"title":"Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH): two cases successfully treated with adalimumab.","abstract":"Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH), also known as dermatitis repens or acrodermatitis perstans, is a rare acropustular eruption, characterized by sterile pustules, paronychia and atrophic skin changes, onychodystrophy and osteolysis of the distal phalanges of the fingers and toes. While some consider ACH a distinct entity, many believe it to be a variant of pustular psoriasis, especially as cases of ACH progressing to generalized pustular psoriasis. The treatment options used are various; however, its typical cyclic recurrences, which induce important physical and psychological morbidity, may render this pathology difficult to treat. Hence, it was considered important to review the evolution of?treatment?options available thus far including use of biologics. Hereby, we report two patients with ACH who were successfully treated with adalimumab. By analogy to the efficacy of TNF-? antagonists in the?treatment?of generalized pustular psoriasis, the two patients we report illustrate the long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in the?treatment?of? Hallopeau's acrodermatitis refractory to therapies.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24215490","annotations":[{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.757154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.735704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.567908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.333359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.282584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Phalanx bone","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.260052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Dermatitis repens","weight":0.211412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis_repens"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.199442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Adalimumab","weight":0.194444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Distal phalanges","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_phalanges"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Paronychia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paronychia"},{"name":"Generalized pustular psoriasis","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_pustular_psoriasis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Rendering (computer graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Automated Clearing House","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Acrodermatitis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrodermatitis"},{"name":"Analogy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy"},{"name":"Cyclic compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
