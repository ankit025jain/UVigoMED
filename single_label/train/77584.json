{"id":77584,"title":"Teacher Stress Questionnaire: validity and reliability study in Italy.","abstract":"This study analyses the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Teacher Stress Questionnaire elaborated in England by Travers and Cooper in 1996. This Italian survey was completed by 863 teachers randomly drawn from a cross-section of Italian school levels. The construct validity of the questionnaire was verified by factor analysis and by measuring the internal consistency of the single scales. All dimensions measured by the Teacher Stress Questionnaire were compared for sample subgroups of all teacher levels. Several meaningful and reliable factors emerged from the factor analysis of the scales. The internal consistency of each scale (Cronbach's alpha) revealed satisfactory values. Teachers' age and school level were determining factors for all dimensions of stress explored. The Italian version of the Teacher Stress Questionnaire showed satisfactory psychometric properties and constitutes a useful and reliable measure to analyse stress in Italian schools.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597443","annotations":[{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.736716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.657294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.548198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.51624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"England","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.393108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.357073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.332591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"School","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Teacher","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0527304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"863","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/863"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
