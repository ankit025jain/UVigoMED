{"id":70880,"title":"[Analysis of the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis for acute myeloid leukemia M2a patients treated by IA and DA regimens].","abstract":"This study was purposed to compare the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia M2a (AML-M2a) patients treated by idarubicin (IDA) combined with cytarabine (Ara-C) (IA) and daunorubicin (DNR) combined cytarabine (Ara-C) (DA) regimens. The clinical data of 65 patients with AML-M2a in our hospital were collected from May 2009 to May 2013 and analyzed. The results indicated the complete remission in IA group was slightly higher than that in DA group, there was no statistically significant difference(P > 0.05); leukocyte minimum value in IA group [(0.58 ± 0.40)×10(9)/L] was obviously lower than that in DA group [(0.99 ± 0.67)×10(9)/L] (P < 0.05); neutrophil minimum value in IA group [(0.19 ± 0.09)×10(9)/L] was significantly lower than that in DA group [(0.21 ± 0.16)×10(9)/L] (P < 0.05); the neutropenia duration in IA group (12.59 ± 5.31)d was much longer than that in DA group (9.17 ± 7.04)d (P < 0.05). The median survival time of patients in IA group was 36.67 months, which was obviously longer than that of patients in DA group (21.45 months) (P < 0.05). The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and chemotherapy regimens were the independently risk factor affecting the prognosis of AML-M2a patients. It is concluded that as compared with DA regimen, the IA regimen can prolong the median survival time and has better long-term therapeutic efficacy, thus it can be used as the first chemotherapy regimen for treatment of AML-M2a.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130813","annotations":[{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Daunorubicin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daunorubicin"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Idarubicin","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idarubicin"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.67842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.552683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.534561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.13183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Group 12 element","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_12_element"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Do not resuscitate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"International Development Association","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Association"},{"name":"Group 9 element","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_9_element"}]}
