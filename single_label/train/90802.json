{"id":90802,"title":"The national health-care agenda in relation to negative pressure wound therapy.","abstract":"The NHS was founded upon the principle of providing health care for all, regardless of financial status. However, it has reached a point where patient demands are outgrowing NHS resources, causing conflict. Chronic wound management represents a considerable financial burden on health services in terms of manpower requirement, equipment, specialist opinion, and adjunct therapies, such as negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Although funding bodies often perceive NPWT to be expensive, there is evidence that if used appropriately it leads to faster healing, early discharge and better quality of life for patients with chronic wounds. However, it must be acknowledged that the type and quality of studies are mixed. Further evidence is required to justify the use of NPWT in chronic wounds in the primary and secondary health-care setting.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575598","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.732987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.567719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.139895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Publicly funded health care","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Negative pressure wound therapy","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_pressure_wound_therapy"},{"name":"Chronic wound","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wound"},{"name":"War","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"}]}
