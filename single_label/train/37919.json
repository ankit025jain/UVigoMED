{"id":37919,"title":"[Efficacy and safety of a phenylalanine-free amino acid-based enteral formula (AA-PKU2) in 1-8 year-old children with phenylketonuria: a prospective, open, self-controlled and multi-center study in China].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a phenylalanine-free amino acid-based enteral formula (AA-PKU2) in the treatment of children with phenylketonuria (PKU) aged 1-8 years.A prospective, open, self-controlled, multi-center trial was performed, enrolling 121 PKU children (1-8 years in age) consecutively between July, 2009 and May, 2011. Enteral nutrition therapy was administered for 32 weeks. The data on blood phenylalanine (PHE) levels, metal development, weight, height, head circumference, serum nutritional biomarkers (total protein, pre-albumin, albumin, total cholesterol, total triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and measurements from routine blood and urine examinations and from renal and hepatic function tests were collected before the therapy and at 8 weeks and 32 weeks after the therapy and were comparatively analyzed.The mean blood PHE level at 8 and 32 weeks of AA-PKU2 treatment was 353±253 and 361±280 µmol/L respectively, significantly lower than that before the treatment (487±327 µmol/L; P<0.01). The difference in intelligence quotient scores before and after AA-PKU2 treatment was not significant (P>0.05) when assessed by the Gesell tests in children aged 1-4 years but significant (P<0.01) when assessed by WPPSI or WISR-R tests in children over 4 years. The average height, weight and head circumference at 8 and 32 weeks after treatment were significantly increased as compared to these measurements before treatment (P<0.01) with absolute levels similar to those in the control children. In contrast, the mean values of total protein, pre-albumin, albumin, total cholesterol, total triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at both time points were not different either from those prior to the treatment or from those in the control children. Mild diarrhea was the adverse events associated with AA-PKU2 treatment, which occurred in 3 (2.5%) cases. All these 3 patients fully recovered without treatment.The phenylalanine-free amino acid-based formula, AA-PKU2, is effective and safe in controlling blood PHE levels and improving mental development with adequate nutritional support in PKU.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461170","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Intelligence quotient","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"},{"name":"Phenylalanine","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Phenylketonuria","weight":0.794137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.732642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.643616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.524623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.46203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.444231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.381731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.354042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.353733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.320374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.116246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Transthyretin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Enteral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteral"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
