{"id":24076,"title":"[Growth peculiarities of commensal Escherichia coli isolates from the gut microflora in Crohn's disease patients].","abstract":"Verhulst's logistic differential equation, popular in mathematical ecology, is used in modeling of population growth, neural networks, statistics, reaction models, Fermi distribution, modeling of tumor growth, etc. We used this function to characterize growth of commensal Escherichia coli isolates from gut microflora in Crohn's disease patients. The results of our investigations show differences in growth parameters of commensal E. coli, isolated from the gut microflora in Crohn's disease patients and healthy volunteers; it is most likely explained by the influence of chronic inflammatory processes on growth and reproduction of these bacteria. It has been established that the used mathematical model well characterizes growth of patients' gut E. coli isolates, and it can be important for the expedient probiotics' application during the disease.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455889","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Theoretical ecology","weight":0.84413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_ecology"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.785426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.728618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.657353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.595533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.561634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.543451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.492411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.422464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.416132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Commensalism","weight":0.40489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.297123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Population growth","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.0690403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Enrico Fermi","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
