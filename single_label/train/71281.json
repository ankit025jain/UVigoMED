{"id":71281,"title":"[Dying with cancer: Hollywood lessons].","abstract":"The study attempts to understand how dying from cancer is portrayed by five movies produced in Hollywood between 1993 and 2006. Based on the cultural studies and their post-structuralism version and supported by the notions of discourse and subjectivity, as proposed by philosopher Michel Foucault, we suggest one of the possible readings of the movie picture corpus. We assess how the movie picture discourse acts as a cultural pedagogy that produces ways of seeing dying with cancer: immortalizing the healthy body image, silencing death, taking care of the dead body and, finally, accepting death. Our proposal is intended to stimulate reflections that may contribute to care and education in nursing.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080714","annotations":[{"name":"Michel Foucault","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault"},{"name":"Post-structuralism","weight":0.832147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism"},{"name":"Cultural studies","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Philosophy","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy"},{"name":"Speech act","weight":0.610321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act"},{"name":"Pedagogy","weight":0.605455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Discourse","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse"},{"name":"World view","weight":0.529513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_view"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.509115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hollywood","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"1993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"}]}
