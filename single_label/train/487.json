{"id":487,"title":"[Tuberculosis and phthisiophobia in Argentina: discourses and conflicts in the construction of the Ascochinga sanitorium, 1925].","abstract":"This article aims to analyze the positions and arguments of various state and social actors around the construction by the \"Argentine Medical Establishmen\" company of a sanatorium for attending to tuberculosis sufferers in the town of Ascochinga, Córdoba, Argentina in 1925. It examines the views on tuberculosis of distinct actors in Córdoba province, beginning with Ascochinga's neighbors, business owners and the President of the Hygiene Council of the province, the President of the Climatology and Climatherapy Commission and the Public Prosecutor, and their arguments for and against the construction of the sanatorium. Although several studies have been performed on the construction and organization of various facilities to house tuberculosis patients, there has been no analysis of the conflicts that the construction generated in the society, as part of the development of institutions for attending to tuberculosis patients. Our hypothesis is that \"phthisiophobia\" (fear of contagion of the disease) was the core element of the arguments used to attack or defend the development of the sanatorium. We consider the case study of Ascochinga sanatorium a paradigmatic case for understanding the discourses and perceptions of the Argentine society around tuberculosis.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481971","annotations":[{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.489597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.448814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.447222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.397581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.383887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.381969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"House","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Prosecutor","weight":0.231976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.190571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"President of the United States","weight":0.187985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.169146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"Sanatorium","weight":0.0783118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatorium"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1925","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1925"},{"name":"Culture of Argentina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Argentina"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Social actions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_actions"},{"name":"Argument","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"}]}
