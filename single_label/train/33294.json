{"id":33294,"title":"[Effectiveness of posterior sagittal anorectoplasty and total urogenital mobilization in treatment of cloacal malformation].","abstract":"To investigate the effectiveness of posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) and total urogenital mobilization in treatment of cloacal malformation.Three girls with cloacal malformation were admitted between June 2010 and June 2013. The age was 2 years, 5 months, and 4 months, respectively. All patients received previous separated sigmoid colostomy. PSARP and total urogenital mobilization were performed to correct the malformation. Colostomy stoma was closed after confirming the patent of rectum and anus. Dilation of anus was sustained for 6 months after anorectoplasty.Operations were successfully completed in 3 cases. The durations of operation were 3 hours and 40 minutes, 4 hours and 20 minutes, and 3 hours and 50 minutes; the blood loss was 10, 20, and 10 mL; and the time of colostomy stoma closure was 3, 5, and 3 months, respectively. Three cases were followed up 13, 18, and 4 months, respectively; no anal stenosis or rectal prolapse occurred. They had normal micturition; the B ultrasonic examination showed that the residual urine volume was less than 10 mL. At 12 months after anorectoplasty, the Wexner scores were 1 and 5 in 2 cases followed up 13 and 18 months; according to Krickenbeck postoperative effect, 2 cases had defecation and no constipation; 1 case had soiling (grade 1).PSARP and total urogenital mobilization should be the first choice in treatment of cloacal malformation with common channel less than 3 cm.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844020","annotations":[{"name":"Colostomy","weight":0.85303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostomy"},{"name":"Rectal prolapse","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal_prolapse"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.804684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stoma","weight":0.75393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.620087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.515061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Cloaca","weight":0.321317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.305013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.291173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.20626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Paraphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly"}]}
