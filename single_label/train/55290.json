{"id":55290,"title":"Lack of association between LUM rs3759223 polymorphism and high myopia.","abstract":"Previous evidence has indicated that the lumican (LUM) gene is a candidate susceptibility gene of high myopia; however, the association between LUM promoter regions rs3759223 polymorphism and high myopia remains controversial and ambiguous. This study performed a meta-analysis to clarify the association between the rs3759223 polymorphism and high myopia risk.Eligible studies were identified by comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Chinese Biomedical Literature database. The crude odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the association between the rs3759223 polymorphism and high myopia susceptibility. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity.Finally, six studies including 1238 cases and 1059 healthy controls were included. Meta-analyses showed no association between rs3759223 polymorphism and high myopia susceptibility in all genetic models (CC vs. TT, OR = 1.089; 95% CI, 0.690 to 1.718; CT vs. TT, OR = 0.865; 95% CI, 0.646 to 1.157; CC + CT vs. TT, OR = 1.202; 95% CI, 0.730 to 1.980; CC vs. CT + TT, OR = 0.914; 95% CI, 0.771 to 1.083) and no significance in subgroup analyses according to the definition of high myopia (based on more myopic than -6.00 diopters vs. not based on more myopic than -6.00 diopters). Publication bias was not evident in this study.This meta-analysis has suggested that there is a lack of association of the rs3759223 polymorphism with high myopia risk. However, further large and well-designed studies with the consideration of LUM gene locus interactions and gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are still required to further evaluate high myopia risk.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Eye
