{"id":46663,"title":"miR-638 suppresses cell proliferation in gastric cancer by targeting Sp2.","abstract":"MicroRNAs play important roles in the development and progression of various cancers. Recent studies have shown that miR-638 was downregulated in several tumors; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not been investigated in detail.The purpose of this study was to determine the role of miR-638 and to elucidate its regulatory mechanism in GC.The expression levels of miR-638 and specificity protein 2 (Sp2) were detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting in GC. After pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-638 vector, miR-638 inhibitor and Sp2-siRNA transfection, the AGS cell proliferation was investigated by MTT assay and cell cycle, and apoptosis was detected using the Annexin V/PI. In addition, the regulation of Sp2 by miR-638 was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot and luciferase reporter assays; cyclin D1 expression was measured by Western blotting.The expression of miR-638 is dramatically down-regulated and Sp2 expression is remarkably up-regulated in GC tissues. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-638 inhibited Sp2 expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of Sp2 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-638 and Sp2-siRNA reduced Sp2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in vitro, and inhibition of miR-638 increased Sp2 expression. Moreover, we found that miR-638 overexpression and Sp2-siRNA markedly suppressed cell proliferation with decreasing expression of cyclin D1 and inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest in vitro; inhibition of miR-638 significantly promoted cell proliferation by increasing expression of cyclin D1 and leading more cells into the S and G2/M phase.Our results demonstrated that miR-638 suppressed GC cell proliferation by targeting Sp2 with influence on the expression of cyclin D1. We suggest that miR-638 might be a candidate predictor or an anticancer therapeutic target for GC patients.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Digestive System
