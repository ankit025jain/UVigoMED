{"id":29032,"title":"Cost-outcome description of clinical pharmacist interventions in a university teaching hospital.","abstract":"Pharmacist interventions are one of the pivotal parts of a clinical pharmacy service within a hospital. This study estimates the cost avoidance generated by pharmacist interventions due to the prevention of adverse drug events (ADE). The types of interventions identified are also analysed.Interventions recorded by a team of hospital pharmacists over a one year time period were included in the study. Interventions were assigned a rating score, determined by the probability that an ADE would have occurred in the absence of an intervention. These scores were then used to calculate cost avoidance. Net cost benefit and cost benefit ratio were the primary outcomes. Categories of interventions were also analysed.A total cost avoidance of €708,221 was generated. Input costs were calculated at €81,942. This resulted in a net cost benefit of €626,279 and a cost benefit ratio of 8.64: 1. The most common type of intervention was the identification of medication omissions, followed by dosage adjustments and requests to review therapies.This study provides further evidence that pharmacist interventions provide substantial cost avoidance to the healthcare payer. There is a serious issue of patient's regular medication being omitted on transfer to an inpatient setting in Irish hospitals.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742158","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical pharmacy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pharmacy"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"University","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.497546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.387433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.357647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"942","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/942"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Tax avoidance and tax evasion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance_and_tax_evasion"},{"name":"ADE classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE_classification"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Categories (Aristotle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_(Aristotle)"},{"name":"Omission (criminal law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_(criminal_law)"},{"name":"Total cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost"}]}
