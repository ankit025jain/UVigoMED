{"id":92758,"title":"In vivo evidence that secretion of HLA-G by immunogenic tumor cells allows their evasion from immunosurveillance.","abstract":"Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) expression by tumors has been evidenced in numerous malignancies in association with poor prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy in humans. Particularly, soluble form of HLA-G was measured at high concentrations in malignant effusions and plasma from cancer patients, and inhibits antitumor immune cells in vitro through interaction with immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) receptors. Nevertheless, in vivo study demonstrating that HLA-G secretion by tumor cells allows their escape from immunosurveillance remained to be established. Despite nondescribed murine homolog, direct functional interaction of HLA-G with murine paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PIR)-B, ortholog of human ILT receptors, enables to investigate its role in vivo. Immunocompetent mice were injected either with syngeneic tumor cells co-expressing HLA-G5, the main soluble HLA-G isoform, and the conformation stabilizer human ?2-microglubulin (h?2m), or with h?2m+ HLA-G5- tumor cells. h?2m expressed at both tumor cell surface acted as a tumor antigen triggering a specific humoral response. Interestingly, although h?2m+ HLA-G5- tumors were rejected, secreted HLA-G5 provided h?2m+ HLA-G5+ tumors a protection against h?2m-elicited immune rejection, enabling such immunogenic tumors to grow similarly to a poorly immunogenic tumor. HLA-G5 tumor expression was associated with local and peripheral immunosuppression, characterized by dampened anti-h?2m B-cell response, quantitative and functional T-and B-cell defects, accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells able to inhibit T-cell proliferation and reduced T- and B-cell tumor infiltrate. Our study provides the first in vivo proof that soluble HLA-G counteracts tumor rejection and reinforces the importance to consider HLA-G as a promising target to optimize current cancer immunotherapies.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623585","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription
