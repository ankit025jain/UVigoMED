{"id":45415,"title":"New physiopathological and therapeutic approaches to diverticular disease: an update.","abstract":"Diverticular disease (DD) of the colon is a widespread disease, which shows worldwide increasing incidence and represents a significant burden for National Health Systems. The current guidelines claim that symptomatic uncomplicated DD (SUDD) has to be treated with spasmolithics and high-fiber diet, whereas both uncomplicated and complicated acute diverticulitis has to be treated with antibiotics. However, new physiopathological knowledge suggests that further treatment may be promising.Pathogenetic and treatment studies on SUDD and acute diverticulitis published in PubMed, www.clinicaltrials.gov , and in the main International Congress were reviewed.Although absorbable antibiotics and 5-aminosalycilic acid seem to be effective in treating SUDD, their role in preventing diverticulitis recurrence is still under debate. Antibiotic use in managing acute diverticulitis is at least questionable, and use of probiotics seems to be promising but need further robust studies to confirm the preliminary results.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684571","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.802814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.757715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.604453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.332477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.262225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.22988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"United States Congress","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Diverticulosis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulosis"},{"name":"Diverticulitis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis"},{"name":"ClinicalTrials.gov","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClinicalTrials.gov"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Doctor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Diverticulum","weight":0.0134992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulum"}]}
