{"id":80783,"title":"Synthesis of 4'-(2-ferrocenyl)-2,2':6'2''-terpyridine: characterization and antiprotozoal activity of Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes.","abstract":"A terpyridine ligand Fctpy was reacted with divalent metals (Cu, Co, Mn, Ni and Zn), yielding five complexes of general formula [Metal(Fctpy)2][PF6]2. The structure of Fctpy was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The complexes characterized using various spectroscopic techniques suggested an octahedral geometry around the central metal ion. These complexes were screened for their antiamoebic, trypanocidal and antimalarial activities. It was found that, complexes 2 and 3 showed better IC50 values than metronidazole against HM1:IMSS strain of Entamoeba histolytica. A substantial parasitic inhibition was not observed for the trypanocidal activity. However, for the erythrocytic stage of W2 strain of Plasmodium falciparum, the complexes inhibited ?-hematin formation. At the concentration of 10 ?g/mL, these complexes did not display toxicity.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534536","annotations":[{"name":"Manganese","weight":0.830373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Nickel","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.750879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.65653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Divalent","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divalent"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.58019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.541308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Metronidazole","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronidazole"},{"name":"Octahedral molecular geometry","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedral_molecular_geometry"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.445723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Diffraction","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction"},{"name":"Antimalarial medication","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication"},{"name":"Octahedron","weight":0.343482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.276462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.276367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.266257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.186766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Single crystal","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_crystal"},{"name":"Protozoa","weight":0.145692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"},{"name":"Terpyridine","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpyridine"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Entamoeba histolytica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba_histolytica"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"}]}
