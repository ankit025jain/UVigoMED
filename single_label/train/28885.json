{"id":28885,"title":"Asystole after the first dose of lansoprazole.","abstract":"Allergic reactions due to drug intake are responsible from an important amount of emergency admissions. Patients mostly complain of urticarial lesions. But clinical picture may sometimes include a large scale of signs and symptoms ranging from a simple confusion to serious conditions like coma and even cardiopulmonary arrest. In this article, a case of anaphylactic shock and respiratory arrest after lansoprazole intake is presented. Delays in reaching basic and advanced life support decrease chance of positive results of life support in anaphylactic shock victims. It is important to remember that any medication we usually prescribe in our daily practice for treatment of any disease has a potential to kill the patient.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768227","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Asystole","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asystole"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Respiratory arrest","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_arrest"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anaphylactic shock","weight":0.781303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylactic_shock"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.710066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.664316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.621046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Life support","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support"},{"name":"Lansoprazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansoprazole"},{"name":"Advanced life support","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_life_support"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
