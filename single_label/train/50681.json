{"id":50681,"title":"Adipose derived stem cells isolated from omentum: a novel source of chemokines for ovarian cancer growth.","abstract":"The main site of ovarian cancer metastasis is the omentum. Omental adipose tissue is known for contribution to the tumor growth and metastasis through different mechanisms.In the present study, adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) were isolated from the omentum of patients with ovarian cancer and those with ovarian cysts and the expression of chemokines, chemokine receptors and cytokines were analyzed.ASCs were isolated from omental adipose tissues obtained of 10 ovarian cancer and 25 ovarian benign cyst patients. Our investigations were done by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction, flowcytometry, western blot and also enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Expression of CXCL-10 and CCR5 showed statistically significant difference between omentum derived ASCs of ovarian cancer patients compared with those with benign cysts (P < 0.05). Expression of interleukin-10 also detected in the supernatant of cultured malignant ASCs.Omental adipose tissue may play crucial roles for tumor promotion through the expression of tumor promoting chemokines. Accordingly, tumor surrounding adipose tissue may be a novel target for immunotherapy of cancer.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762504","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"CCR5","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.673874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.612577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Chemokine receptor","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine_receptor"},{"name":"Greater omentum","weight":0.145438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ovarian cyst","weight":0.0606686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cyst"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"CXCL10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL10"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
