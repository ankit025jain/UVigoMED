{"id":38068,"title":"Canakinumab for gout: a specific, patient-profiled indication.","abstract":"The role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in inflammation induced by crystals, and especially by monosodium urate crystals (MSUCs), has raised much interest in both basic and clinical investigation. Several drugs have been developed, and more are still in development, to block IL-1 driven inflammation, though to date only canakinumab (blocking IL-1?) has been labelled, yet limited to the European Union, with a restricted indication to treat episodes of acute inflammation (EAIs) in patients with gout in whom other therapeutic choices are unacceptable. Other medications developed for IL-1 blocking, such as anakinra and rilonacept, have been tested in gout patients in clinical trials, but lack label approval and may be further restricted to orphan indication in gout. Notwithstanding, the use of IL-1 blockade to prevent EAIs in gout looks promising, but no drug has yet obtained approval for such an indication.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451032","annotations":[{"name":"Gout","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.787868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.50729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Monosodium glutamate","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate"},{"name":"Orphan","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Anakinra","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakinra"},{"name":"Canakinumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canakinumab"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Record label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_management"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
