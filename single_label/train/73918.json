{"id":73918,"title":"Management options for established chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.","abstract":"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and debilitating condition associated with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. Clinicians are cognizant of the negative impact of CIPN on cancer treatment outcomes and patients' psychosocial functioning and quality of life. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, clinicians and patients try various therapeutic interventions, despite limited evidence to support efficacy of these treatments. The rationale for such use is mostly based on the evidence for the treatment options in non-CIPN peripheral neuropathy syndromes, as this area is more robustly studied than is CIPN treatment. In this manuscript, we examine the existing evidence for both CIPN and non-CIPN treatments and develop a summary of the best available evidence with the aim of developing a practical approach to the treatment of CIPN, based on available literature and clinical practice experience.
