{"id":4174,"title":"[Force-feeding of hunger-striking prisoners].","abstract":"In contrast to the position of the World Medical Association and the Ethics Council of the Israel Medical Association, the author argues for forced-feeding of hunger-striking prisoners when their condition reaches a stage of danger of death or permanent injury. This position is based on the priority of human life over autonomy, and of a communitarian ethic. This position is supported by a District Court decision ordering the feeding of a hunger-striking prisoner, by a Supreme Court decision imposing surgery on a non-consenting prisoner, and in line with Israel's Patient's Right Law.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417495","annotations":[{"name":"Israel","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.56142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.44099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"World Medical Association","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Medical_Association"},{"name":"Autonomy","weight":0.340999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"},{"name":"Supreme Court of the United States","weight":0.232941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Prisoner of war","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Communitarianism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communitarianism"},{"name":"Israel Medical Association","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Medical_Association"},{"name":"United States district court","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court"}]}
