{"id":65115,"title":"Two miRNA clusters, miR-34b/c and miR-449, are essential for normal brain development, motile ciliogenesis, and spermatogenesis.","abstract":"Ablation of a single miRNA gene rarely leads to a discernable developmental phenotype in mice, in some cases because of compensatory effects by other functionally related miRNAs. Here, we report that simultaneous inactivation of two functionally related miRNA clusters (miR-34b/c and miR-449) encoding five miRNAs (miR-34b, miR-34c, miR-449a, miR-449b, and miR-449c) led to sexually dimorphic, partial perinatal lethality, growth retardation, and infertility. These developmental defects correlated with the dysregulation of ? 240 target genes, which are mainly involved in three major cellular functions, including cell-fate control, brain development and microtubule dynamics. Our data demonstrate an essential role of a miRNA family in brain development, motile ciliogenesis, and spermatogenesis.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982181","annotations":[{"name":"Microtubule","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Spermatogenesis","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogenesis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Centriole","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centriole"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.665421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.434851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.214399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.205461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.0954923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
