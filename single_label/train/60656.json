{"id":60656,"title":"Incidence and prognostic significance of myocardial late gadolinium enhancement in patients with sarcoidosis without cardiac manifestation.","abstract":"Cardiac death is the leading cause of mortality associated with sarcoidosis in Japan. However, the involvement of sarcoidosis infiltration often remains undetected. Recently, late gadolinium enhancement with cardiovascular MRI (LGE-CMR) imaging has been introduced for the detection of myocardial infiltrative disease, as it enables the detection of even minor myocardial damage. We investigated the incidence and prognostic value of LGE-CMR in patients with extracardiac sarcoidosis without cardiac manifestations.Sixty-one consecutive patients who met the histologic and clinical criteria for sarcoidosis, and who did not have signs or symptoms of cardiovascular involvement, were prospectively recruited. LGE-CMR was performed at the time of enrollment, and patients were classified into positive or negative late gadolinium enhancement groups based on the findings. The study end point was a composite of all-cause death, symptomatic arrhythmia, and heart failure necessitating admission.Patients were predominantly middle aged (57 ± 15 years) and female (66%), and most had stable disease activity that did not require treatment with immunosuppressants. LGE-CMR detected cardiac involvement in eight patients (13%). Interventricular septal thinning detected by echocardiography was an independent predictor of LGE-CMR-detected cardiac involvement. During the follow-up period of 50 ± 12 months, no significant difference in adverse events was noted between patients in the LGE-CMR-positive and LGE-CMR-negative groups.LGE-CMR detected cardiac involvement in 13% of patients with sarcoidosis without cardiac manifestation, but both patients with and without LGE had relatively low event rates.Japan Primary Registries Network; No.: UMIN000001549; URL: www.umin.ac.jp.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853830","annotations":[{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.695156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.693606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.682324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.335456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Middle age","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_age"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
