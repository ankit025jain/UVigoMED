{"id":30453,"title":"TAK1 binding protein 2 is essential for liver protection from stressors.","abstract":"The liver is the first line of defense from environmental stressors in that hepatocytes respond to and metabolize them. Hence, hepatocytes can be damaged by stressors. Protection against hepatic cell damage and cell death is important for liver function and homeostasis. TAK1 (MAP3K7) is an intermediate of stressors such as bacterial moieties-induced signal transduction pathways in several cell types. Tak1 deficiency has been reported to induce spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the regulatory mechanism of TAK1 activity in liver stress response has not yet been defined. Here we report that activation of TAK1 through TAK1 binding protein 2 (TAB2) is required for liver protection from stressors. We found that a bacterial moiety, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), activated TAK1 in primary hepatocytes, which was diminished by deletion of TAB2. Mice having hepatocyte-specific deletion of the Tab2 gene exhibited only late-onset moderate liver lesions but were hypersensitive to LPS-induced liver injury. Furthermore, we show that a chemical stressor induced greatly exaggerated liver injury in hepatocyte-specific Tab2-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that TAB2 is a sensor of stress conditions in the liver and functions to protect the liver by activating the TAK1 pathway.
