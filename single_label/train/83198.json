{"id":83198,"title":"[Malignant parotid tumors: epidemiology in Togo].","abstract":"We had for aim to determine the epidemiological profile of malignant parotid tumors in sub-Saharan country: Togo.We retrospectively studied the files of patients seen and treated for malignant parotid tumors, from January 1989 to December 31, 2008, at the Tokoin teaching hospital. Patients treated for another malignant tumor at the same time were excluded from the study.Ninety-six patients were included. Thirty-one tumors (32.29%) were malignant, in 18 male and 13 female patients with a sex ratio of 1.38. The average age was 39years (range 24-70years of age). Two patients could not undergo surgery. Histologically, there were 10 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (32.26%), 6 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma (19.4%), 6 cases of adenocarcinoma (19.4%), 4 cases of carcinoma in pleomorphic adenoma (12.90%), 3 cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (9.7%), 1 case of acinar carcinoma (3.2%), and 1 case of cystadenocarcinoma (3.2%).Squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequent histological type observed in Togo, contrary to literature data for which mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most frequent malignant parotid tumor.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412403","annotations":[{"name":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoid_cystic_carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucoepidermoid_carcinoma"},{"name":"Pleomorphic adenoma","weight":0.863267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphic_adenoma"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cystadenocarcinoma","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystadenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.390167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Pharyngeal tonsil","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_tonsil"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.13183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Togo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togo"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Acinus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinus"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
