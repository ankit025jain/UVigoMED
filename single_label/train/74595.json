{"id":74595,"title":"Protocadherins in neurological diseases.","abstract":"Cadherins were originally isolated as calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules and are characterized by their cadherin motifs in the extracellular domain. In vertebrates, including humans, there are more than 100 different cadherin-related genes, which constitute the cadherin superfamily. The protocadherin (Pcdh) family comprises a large subgroup within the cadherin superfamily. The Pcdhs are divided into clustered and non-clustered Pcdhs, based on their genomic structure. Almost all the Pcdh genes are expressed widely in the brain and play important roles in brain development and in the regulation of brain function. This chapter presents an overview of Pcdh family members with regard to their functions, knockout mouse phenotypes, and association with neurological diseases and tumors.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300142","annotations":[{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Vertebrate","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cadherin","weight":0.724625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadherin"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.644251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.458999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.337617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.287592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Structural motif","weight":0.118068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_motif"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Protocadherin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocadherin"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
