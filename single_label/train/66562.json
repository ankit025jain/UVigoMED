{"id":66562,"title":"Improved durability of flex-Xc digital flexible ureteroscope: how long can you expect it to last?","abstract":"To retrospectively analyze a significant number of flexible ureterorenoscopic procedures performed with the Storz Flex-Xc model to evaluate its durability.Between May 2012 and May 2013, all the flexible ureteroscopic procedures performed with 3 Storz Flex-Xc flexible ureteroscopes were analyzed. Relocation of the lower pole stones was performed in all cases when possible. In the second and third series, the access sheath was retracted together with the flexible ureteroscope, thus preventing the damages, which its distal part may inflict on the flexed endoscope.A total of 406 procedures were performed on 372 patients: first endoscope used on 96 procedures (90 patients), second one on 151 procedures (139 patients), and third one on 159 procedures (143 patients). Ureteral access sheath was used in 71.4% of the cases. The first endoscope was used for 67.1 hours, the second for 107.7 hours, and the third one for 107.2 hours. Major repairs were needed after significant damages of the outer coating (first endoscope) and severe deterioration of the deflecting mechanism (second and third endoscopes).The digital Storz Flex-Xc seems to be a durable model of flexible ureteroscope. The use of ureteral access sheath and avoidance of overstressing the deflection mechanism by relocating lower pole stones seem to offer substantial advantages in prolonging the lifespan of these expensive instruments.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703462","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Ureteroscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureteroscopy"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0232656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"372","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Wear","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Relocation (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Storz Brewing Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storz_Brewing_Company"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"}]}
