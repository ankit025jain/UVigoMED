{"id":10075,"title":"Longitudinal PET imaging of muscular inflammation using 18F-DPA-714 and 18F-Alfatide II and differentiation with tumors.","abstract":"(18)F-DPA-714 is a PET tracer that recognizes macrophage translocator protein (TSPO), and (18)F-Alfatide II ((18)F-AlF-NOTA-E[PEG4-c(RGDfk)]2) is specific for integrin ?v?3. This study aims to apply these two tracers for longitudinal PET imaging of muscular inflammation, and evaluate the value of (18)F-DPA-714 in differentiating inflammation from tumor.RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells were used for cell uptake analysis of (18)F-DPA-714. A mouse hind limb muscular inflammation model was established by intramuscular injection of turpentine oil. For the inflammation model, PET imaging was performed at different days using (18)F-DPA-714 and (18)F-Alfatide II. The specificity of the imaging probes was tested by co- or pre-injection of PK11195 or unlabeled RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide. PET imaging using (18)F-DPA-714 was performed in A549, HT29, U87MG, INS-1, and 4T1 xenograft models. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to evaluate infiltrated macrophages and angiogenesis in inflammation and/or tumors.Uptake of (18)F-DPA-714 in RAW264.7 cells was 45.5% at 1 h after incubation, and could be blocked by PK11195. PET imaging showed increased (18)F-DPA-714 and (18)F-Alfatide II uptake at inflammatory muscles. Peak uptake of (18)F-DPA-714 was seen on day 6 (4.02 ± 0.64 %ID/g), and peak uptake of (18)F-Alfatide II was shown on day 12 (1.87 ± 0.35 %ID/g) at 1 h p.i.. Tracer uptakes could be inhibited by PK11195 for (18)F-DPA-714 or cold RGD for (18)F-Alfatide II. Moreover, macrophage depletion with liposomal clodronate also reduced the local accumulation of both tracers. A549, HT29, U87MG, INS-1, and 4T1 tumor uptakes of (18)F-DPA-714 (0.46 ± 0.28, 0.91 ± 0.08, 1.69 ± 0.67, 1.13 ± 0.33, 1.22 ± 0.55 %ID/g at 1 h p.i., respectively) were significantly lower than inflammation uptake (All P < 0.05).PET imaging using (18)F-DPA-714 as a TSPO targeting tracer could evaluate the dynamics of macrophage activation and infiltration in different stages of inflammatory diseases. The concomitant longitudinal PET imaging with both (18)F-DPA-714 and (18)F-Alfatide II matched the causal relationship between macrophage infiltration and angiogenesis. Moreover, we found (18)F-DPA-714 uptake in several types of tumors is significantly lower than that in inflammatory muscles, suggesting (18)F-DPA-714 PET has the potential for better differentiation of tumor and non-tumor inflammation.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672585","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.792843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.78153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.584601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.561899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.401339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.387499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.316039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.244683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.180104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Clodronic acid","weight":0.0489124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clodronic_acid"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Hindlimb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindlimb"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
