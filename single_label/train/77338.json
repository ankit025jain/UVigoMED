{"id":77338,"title":"[The inclusion of the subject safety in the school curriculum;checking the validity of the hypothesis in schools in three provinces].","abstract":"According to Italian Legislative Decree no. 81/2008, workplace safety will have to be introduced in school and university curricula. The main objectives of this study of the Italian Ministry of Labour were to verify knowledge about workplace safety among primary and secondary school students and evaluate the effectiveness of a training course in improving students' knowledge. Three provinces with an above average workforce/injuries ratio (with respect to the national average) were identified. An evaluation questionnaire was administered to students in the three provinces. Students then attended training courses about workplace safety and were then administered the same questionnaire. Primary school students improved by an average of 35.5%, middle school students by 33.3%, high school students by 18.6%. Results suggests that the training intervention was effective.
