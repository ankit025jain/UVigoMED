{"id":61821,"title":"[Variations of the volume and segmental blood flow in the upper extremity of the patents presenting with breast cancer treated with the application of various regimes of pneumatic compression].","abstract":"Post-mastectomy lymphedema on the side of the surgical intervention is a major complication of radical therapy of breast cancer patients. Pneumatic compression (compression pump technology) of various types, modes and techniques is used for their rehabilitation. A total of 192 breast cancer patients with I-IV degree lymphedema were available for the examination in the present study. All of them were treated with the application of different modes of one- and multi-chambered pneumatic compression. Based on the results of aqueous and impedance plethysmography, the multi-chambered pneumatic compression was identified as the most effective methods for the purpose, with the pressure inside the chambers below 60-80 mm Hg and the duration of the treatment 45-60 min per day. It is recommended to perform three treatment courses each consisting of 15 procedures with the intervals of 3-6 months between them (depending on the severity of the edema).","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665598","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.726519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.719464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.408948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.251888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.194585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.118306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.105329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Effective results in number theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_results_in_number_theory"},{"name":"Variation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Bicameralism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"},{"name":"Plethysmograph","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plethysmograph"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
