{"id":50474,"title":"[Anesthetic management for removal of a giant ovarian tumor using FloTrac x Vigileo monitoring system].","abstract":"We successfully managed anesthesia in a patient with a giant ovarian tumor weighting 22 kg, using FloTrac x Vigileo monitoring system. A 43-year-old woman (67.2 kg, 154.5 cm and abdominal girth 111.3 cm) was admitted for removal of a giant ovarian tumor. Arterial blood pressure (ABP), heart rate, percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume variation (SVV) were monitored. General anesthesia was induced, with the patient in the supine position, using 50 mg propofol, 0.25 microgram x kg(-1) x min(-1) remifentanil. 30 mg rocuronium bromide and inhalation of 100% oxygen, and maintained with sevoflurane 1.5% and remifentanil administration between 0.1-0.3 microgram x kg(-1) x min(-1). Following 6 l fluid drainage from the ovarian tumor, ABP and CI decreased, but SVV remained within normal ranges. Therefore, we only decreased the drainage speed without increasing fluid administration rate. When the tumor was lifted up, both CI and SVV increased, but the increase of SVV was 10%, still within normal ranges. Therefore, we did not increase fluid administration rate to avoid excessive hydration. After tracheal extubation, respiratory and hemodynamic states were stable, and the patient had no postoperative complication. We conclude that FloTrac x Vigileo System is useful for monitoring cardiac performance parameters, and helps anesthesiologists adjust drainage speed of the content and infusion rate to maintain the stability of circulatory state, in removal of a giant cyst.","date":"2014-05-01","categories":"Endocrine System
