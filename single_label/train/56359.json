{"id":56359,"title":"The \"diffuse-trickling\" fundus autofluorescence phenotype in geographic atrophy.","abstract":"To further characterize a subgroup of patients exhibiting the fundus autofluorescence (FAF) \"diffuse-trickling\" phenotype associated with geographic atrophy (GA).In the context of the Fundus Autofluorescence in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (FAM) Study, patients with diffuse-trickling GA were examined and characterized by FAF and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging. Age, sex distribution, and medical history were compared with FAM study patients (n = 288, 60.1% female) with other GA phenotypes (non-diffuse-trickling). In a subset of patients, subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) was analyzed.Patients with diffuse-trickling (n = 61), compared with patients with non-diffuse-trickling GA, had a significantly younger age at first presentation (68.2 ± 11.6 vs. 75.4 ± 8.1 years, P < 0.001), a shift in the proportion of men from 55% in the age group younger than 65 to 19% in the age group older than or equal to 65, and a significantly higher rate of myocardial infarction (MI) in the age group younger than 65 (24% vs. 0%, P = 0.011); all but one patient with MI were male. Further evaluation revealed that in the age group younger than 65, 54% of patients with diffuse-trickling had been hospitalized due to cardiovascular diseases including hypertensive crisis, angina, and MI. Analysis of choroidal thickness revealed a significantly thinner SCT in diffuse-trickling compared with non-diffuse-trickling GA (135.2 ± 56.4 vs. 191.4 ± 77.8 ?m, P < 0.001).","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699379","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence
