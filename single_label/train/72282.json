{"id":72282,"title":"Analysis of exhaled breath for diagnosing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a feasibility study.","abstract":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) are wide-spread cancers that often lead to disfigurement and loss of important functions such as speech and ingestion. To date, HNSCC has no adequate method for early detection and screening.Exhaled breath samples were collected from 87 volunteers; 62 well-defined breath samples from 22 HNSCC patients (larynx and pharynx), 21 patients with benign tumours (larynx and pharynx) and 19 healthy controls were analysed in a dual approach: (i) chemical analysis using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and (ii) breath-print analysis using an array of nanomaterial-based sensors, combined with a statistical algorithm.Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry identified ethanol, 2-propenenitrile and undecane as potential markers for HNSCC and/or benign tumours of the head and neck. The sensor-array-based breath-prints could clearly distinguish HNSCC both from benign tumours and from healthy states. Within the HNSCC group, patients could be classified according to tumour site and stage.We have demonstrated the feasibility of a breath test for a specific, clinically interesting application: distinguishing HNSCC from tumour-free or benign tumour states, as well as for staging and locating HNSCC. The sensor array used here could form the basis for the development of an urgently needed non-invasive, cost-effective, fast and reliable point-of-care diagnostic/screening tool for HNSCC.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983369","annotations":[{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.732752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.709591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.642728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.595495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.483031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.258198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.203088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.106748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Benign tumor","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Breath test","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_test"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry","weight":0.0136018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry"}]}
