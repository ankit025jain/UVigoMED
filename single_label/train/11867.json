{"id":11867,"title":"Spinal cord stimulation for heart failure: preclinical studies to determine optimal stimulation parameters for clinical efficacy.","abstract":"Spinal cord stimulation with implantable devices has been used worldwide for decades to treat regional pain conditions and cardiac angina refractory to conventional therapies. Preclinical studies with spinal cord stimulation in experimental animal models of heart disease have described interesting effects on cardiac and autonomic nervous system physiology. In canine and porcine animals with failing hearts, spinal cord stimulation reverses left ventricular dilation and improves cardiac function, while suppressing the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias. In this paper, we present further canine studies that determined the optimal site and intensity of spinal cord stimulation that produced the most robust and beneficial clinical response in heart failure animals. We then explore and discuss the clinically relevant aspects and potential impediments that may be encountered in translating spinal cord stimulation to human patients with advanced cardiac disease.
