{"id":79015,"title":"Radiographic adenoid evaluation--suggestion of referral parameters.","abstract":"this study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of current radiographic measurements, which were originally conceived to evaluate adenoid hypertrophy, as potential referral parameters.children aged from 4 to 14 years, of both genders, who presented nasal obstruction complaints, were subjected to cavum radiography. Radiographic examinations (n = 120) were evaluated according to categorical and quantitative parameters, and data were compared to gold-standard videonasopharyngoscopic examination, regarding accuracy (sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity, and positive predictive value).radiographic grading systems presented low sensitivity for the identification of patients with two-thirds choanal space obstruction. However, some of these parameters presented relatively high specificity rates when three-quarters adenoid obstruction was the threshold of interest. Amongst the quantitative variables, a mathematical model was found to be more suitable for identifying patients with more than two-thirds obstruction.this model was shown to be potentially useful as a screening tool to include patients with, at least, two-thirds adenoid obstruction. Moreover, one of the categorical parameters was demonstrated to be relatively more useful, as well as a potentially safer assessment tool to exclude patients with less than three-quarters obstruction, to be indicated for adenoidectomy.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508014","annotations":[{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.305637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.118354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharyngeal tonsil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_tonsil"},{"name":"Adenoidectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoidectomy"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Adenoid hypertrophy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoid_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Rugby league positions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league_positions"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Categorical data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_data"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
