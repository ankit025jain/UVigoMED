{"id":5003,"title":"Sports-related testicular injuries and the use of protective equipment among young male athletes.","abstract":"To survey young male athletes to determine the self-reported prevalence of sports-related testicular injuries and use of protective equipment among adolescents and young adults.A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to male students at local high schools and colleges. Respondents were asked about personal and team member usage of athletic cups and history of testicular injuries. Returned surveys were analyzed for descriptive statistics and compared between high school and college respondents.Approximately 1700 surveys were distributed and 731 returned. The mean age of all respondents was 17.7 years. Across all sports, 18% of athletes experienced a testicular injury during sports and 36.4% observed injuries in team members, whereas only 12.9% of respondents reported wearing athletic cups. The prevalence of testicular injuries for lacrosse, wrestling, baseball, and football was 48.5%, 32.8%, 21%, and 17.8%, respectively. Of athletes reporting a prior injury, 20.1% reported that they wear a cup now. Rates of athletic cup usage were significantly less for college baseball, football, and all respondents compared with their high school counterparts.Previously reported rates of testicular injury with sports participation may underestimate the prevalence of these injuries among adolescent and young adult athletes among whom testicular protective equipment is infrequently used.","date":"2014-11-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25432843","annotations":[{"name":"Lacrosse","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse"},{"name":"Baseball","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"College baseball","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_baseball"},{"name":"College","weight":0.671548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Wrestling","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"History","weight":0.53624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.510704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.503451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.503104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.263204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.25009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"School","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Personal protective equipment","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment"},{"name":"1700","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1700"},{"name":"Stanley Cup","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Young-adult fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young-adult_fiction"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Crime statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_statistics"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Single-elimination tournament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
