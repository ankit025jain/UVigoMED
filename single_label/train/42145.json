{"id":42145,"title":"Particle conformation regulates antibody access to a conserved GII.4 norovirus blockade epitope.","abstract":"GII.4 noroviruses (NoVs) are the primary cause of epidemic viral acute gastroenteritis. One primary obstacle to successful NoV vaccination is the extensive degree of antigenic diversity among strains. The major capsid protein of GII.4 strains is evolving rapidly, resulting in the emergence of new strains with altered blockade epitopes. In addition to characterizing these evolving blockade epitopes, we have identified monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize a blockade epitope conserved across time-ordered GII.4 strains. Uniquely, the blockade potencies of MAbs that recognize the conserved GII.4 blockade epitope were temperature sensitive, suggesting that particle conformation may regulate functional access to conserved blockade non-surface-exposed epitopes. To map conformation-regulating motifs, we used bioinformatics tools to predict conserved motifs within the protruding domain of the capsid and designed mutant VLPs to test the impacts of substitutions in these motifs on antibody cross-GII.4 blockade. Charge substitutions at residues 310, 316, 484, and 493 impacted the blockade potential of cross-GII.4 blockade MAbs with minimal impact on the blockade of MAbs targeting other, separately evolving blockade epitopes. Specifically, residue 310 modulated antibody blockade temperature sensitivity in the tested strains. These data suggest access to the conserved GII.4 blockade antibody epitope is regulated by particle conformation, temperature, and amino acid residues positioned outside the antibody binding site. The regulating motif is under limited selective pressure by the host immune response and may provide a robust target for broadly reactive NoV therapeutics and protective vaccines.In this study, we explored the factors that govern norovirus (NoV) cross-strain antibody blockade. We found that access to the conserved GII.4 blockade epitope is regulated by temperature and distal residues outside the antibody binding site. These data are most consistent with a model of NoV particle conformation plasticity that regulates antibody binding to a distally conserved blockade epitope. Further, antibody \"locking\" of the particle into an epitope-accessible conformation prevents ligand binding, providing a potential target for broadly effective drugs. These observations open lines of inquiry into the mechanisms of human NoV entry and uncoating, fundamental biological questions that are currently unanswerable for these noncultivatable pathogens.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Digestive System
