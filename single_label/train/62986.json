{"id":62986,"title":"Matrin 3 co-immunoprecipitates with the heat shock proteins glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), GRP75 and glutathione S-transferase ? isoform 2 (GST?2) in thymoma cells.","abstract":"Here, we report evidence that matrin 3 (MATR3), a highly conserved inner nuclear matrix phosphoprotein, whose function is largely unknown, interacts specifically with the heat shock proteins glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), GRP75 and glutathione S-transferase ? isoform 2 (GST?2). Using immunoprecipitation experiments of lysates obtained from control and tributyltin oxide (TBTO)-treated thymoma cell line (EL4), we identified MATR3 and its partners by MS/MS analysis and confirmed by immunoblot. We also show that MATR3 undergoes degradation as reported before and that this cleavage process, which is inhibited by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK, is more marked in TBTO-treated cells. Further, we found that the heat shock protein glucose-regulated protein 78 was downregulated in the TBTO-treated cells. The GRP78 protein is known to protect cells from apoptosis by complexing with procaspase 7 thereby preventing caspase activation cascade. By immunoblot analysis, we found that the levels of procaspases-3 and -7 were lower in TBTO-treated cells; in contrast, the level of p20, the active form of caspase 3, was relatively higher in the treated cells compared to that of control cells. We propose that the TBTO-mediated downregulation of GRP78 triggers the caspase cascade pathway leading to MATR3 degradation.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491357","annotations":[{"name":"Heat shock protein","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock_protein"},{"name":"Caspase 3","weight":0.847643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_3"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Heat shock","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.754445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.707743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.649198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.495641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Phosphoprotein","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoprotein"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Thymoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymoma"},{"name":"Nuclear matrix","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_matrix"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
