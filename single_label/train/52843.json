{"id":52843,"title":"Laparoscopic ovarian ligament plication in pregnancy.","abstract":"This 32-year old patient presented at seven weeks gestation with severe left-sided lower abdominal pain. This was against the background of a previous history of left salpingectomy from a ruptured ectopic gestation seven years previously. Transvaginal sonographic evaluation revealed a viable seven week intrauterine embryo, a 2 cm left corpus luteum cyst and Doppler studies revealed reduced internal flow. This led the way for a conservative approach via laparoscopy of untwisting the pedicle to restore blood flow In this case, the ovarian ligament was shorted using 1/0 vicryl and the pregnancy went to term.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564070","annotations":[{"name":"Corpus luteum","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_luteum"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Salpingectomy","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salpingectomy"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.687712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.673752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Ovarian ligament","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_ligament"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
