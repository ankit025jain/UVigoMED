{"id":92050,"title":"Outcome of long-axis percutaneous sacroplasty for the treatment of sacral insufficiency fractures with a radiofrequency-induced, high-viscosity bone cement.","abstract":"Our goal was to assess the technical results in patients who underwent long-axis sacroplasty for the treatment of sacral insufficiency fractures (SIF) by radiofrequency-induced high-viscosity bone cement augmentation. Twelve patients with bilateral sacral fractures were treated by augmentation with radiofrequency-activated, high-viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement under local anesthesia. CT-guided sacroplasty was performed by using a long-axis approach through a single entry point. Thirty-six vertebrae were treated in 12 sessions under a combination of CT and fluoroscopic guidance using a bilateral access and a cavity-creating osteotome prior to remote-controlled, hydraulically driven cement injection. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score before sacroplasty and at 1 and 3 months after the treatment was obtained. PMMA leaks were evaluated retrospectively using the post-interventional CT. The mean amount of high-viscosity PMMA injected per patient was 7.8 ml. No major adverse events were observed. In the first 4 days after the procedure, the mean VAS score decreased from 8.1?±?1.9 to mean 3.1?±?1.2 and was followed by a gradual but continuous decrease throughout the rest of the follow-up period at 24 weeks (mean 2.2?±?1.1) and 48 weeks (mean 2.1?±?1.4). CT fluoroscopy-guided sacral augmentation was safe and effective in all 12 patients with osteoporotic SIF.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453025","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.73526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.722376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.693405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.676677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.586928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.510274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.459367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.275235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hydraulics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics"},{"name":"Osteotome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotome"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"News leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Entry point","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_point"}]}
