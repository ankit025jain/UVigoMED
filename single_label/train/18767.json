{"id":18767,"title":"Statin therapy may prevent development of tuberculosis in diabetic state.","abstract":"Host cholesterol is widely getting recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in multiple ways. Therefore it is logically expected that cholesterol reduction by statins is going to have a positive outcome in the context of tuberculosis management. But at the present moment statin therapy in non diabetic individuals is believed to pose a small risk for development of diabetes mellitus, a prevalent disease throughout the globe that is known to be associated with tuberculosis infection. Consequently, in diabetic individuals statins are commonly prescribed drugs for multiple positive outcomes. Therefore it seems that statin therapy in diabetes mellitus has the potential to prevent the increased occurrence of tuberculosis in diabetic state.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767940","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.814495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.744256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.414693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.162914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.121652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Presenter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenter"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"World","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World"}]}
