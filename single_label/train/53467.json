{"id":53467,"title":"RASSF7 and RASSF8 proteins are predictive factors for development and metastasis in malignant thyroid neoplasms.","abstract":"To study the expression status of Ras-association domain family 7 (RASSF7) and Ras-association domain family 8 (RASSF8) in nodular thyroid goiter (NTG), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and establish whether a correlation exists between the presence of RASSF7 and RASSF8 proteins and clinicopathological parameters of the disease.RASSF7 and RASSF8 protein expression was examined immunohistochemically on paraffin-embedded thyroid tissues from 112 cases with PTC, 20 cases with MTC, and 38 cases with NTG.The immunohistochemical expression of RASSF7 and RASSF8 was higher in PTC and MTC than in NTG (P < 0.001). In thyroid carcinomas, RASSF7 and RASSF8 expression was significantly correlated with a more advanced TNM stage (P = 0.035, P = 0.037), age, sex, lymph node metastasis (P = 0.006, P = 0.002), and tumor size (P = 0.012, P = 0.015).RASSF7 and RASSF8 expression was increased in PTC and MTC compared to NTG, and this may be linked to the development and progression of thyroid carcinoma. In addition, these proteins were correlated with more advanced tumor stages, tumor size, and metastasis.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516056","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.819178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.763339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.698854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Medullary thyroid cancer","weight":0.643078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Thyroid neoplasm","weight":0.271491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_neoplasm"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.213089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"}]}
