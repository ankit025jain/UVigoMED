{"id":45234,"title":"[Laparoscopic repair of incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia as a late complication of laparoscopic right hepatectomy: a case report].","abstract":"Incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia after laparoscopic right hepatectomy is very rare. An 81-year-old man underwent laparoscopic right hepatectomy for giant hepatic hemangioma. Twenty months after the surgery, he began to complain of nausea and abdominal pain and was brought to our hospital. Chest X-ray showed an abdominal gas shadow above the right diaphragm and computed tomography showed herniation of the colon into the right thoracic cavity. We diagnosed ileus due to incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia and performed emergency operation under laparoscopic surgery. After successfully reducing the prolapsed colon back to the abdominal cavity, the diaphragmatic hernia orifice was repaired. Incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia sometimes causes the fatal state. Clinicians must therefore consider such findings a late complication of laparoscopic hepatectomy.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693692","annotations":[{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.802204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Ileus","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileus"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Abdominal cavity","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cavity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.52381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.384919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.23456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diaphragmatic hernia","weight":0.16833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_hernia"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Incarceration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"}]}
