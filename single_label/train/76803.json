{"id":76803,"title":"Management of parenteral nutrition associated hyperglycaemia: a comparison of subcutaneous and intravenous insulin regimen.","abstract":"PN is associated with significant hyperglycaemia, which may be detrimental to clinical outcome. There are few data on the management of this phenomenon outside of intensive care units. In our unit, we studied the efficacy of protocol-based intravenous insulin delivery as compared to subcutaneous insulin prescribed individually outside of the critical care setting. In a retrospective review over a two-year period, we compared patients with PN-associated hyperglycaemia who had received both modes of insulin therapy. A total of 122 who developed PN-associated hyperglycaemia were identified. Those on the intravenous insulin regimen were within glycaemic target for more time than those on the subcutaneous regimen (62% Vs 43%, p = 0.008). We therefore conclude that outside of the critical care setting, intravenous insulin delivers better glycaemic control and should therefore be considered optimum therapy for patients with PN-associated hyperglycaemia.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908857","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.662605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.645467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.642203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.093553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.032094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0125579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"}]}
