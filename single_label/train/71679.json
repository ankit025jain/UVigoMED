{"id":71679,"title":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for the preservation of ovarian function among women with breast cancer who did not use tamoxifen after chemotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"To determine whether concurrent use of GnRH agonists with chemotherapy preserves ovarian function in women with breast cancer who did not use tamoxifen.Systematic review and meta-analysis.University-based hospitals.Premenopausal women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy who did not receive tamoxifen.Randomization to concurrent GnRH agonists with chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.Odds ratio (OR) of resumption of menses 1 year or more after chemotherapy.Searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Trials Register, and the National Research Register through March 2014, and all randomized trials that reported resumption of menses 1 year or more after GnRH agonist with chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone among women with breast cancer who did not receive tamoxifen were included. Four studies were analyzed in the meta-analysis and included 252 patients (GnRH agonist with chemotherapy, n=131; chemotherapy alone, n=121). There was no significant difference in the rate of return of menses between the two groups (OR, 1.47; 95% confidence interval [0.60-3.62]). Heterogeneity among the trials was not significant (I2=16.6%).Concurrent GnRH agonists with chemotherapy may not preserve ovarian function in women with breast cancer. Furthermore, randomized data are limited regarding fertility after concurrent use of GnRH agonists with chemotherapy.","date":"2014-08-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25044080","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.842185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.77492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.742332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist","weight":0.739173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.631534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.622214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.567912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.347222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.327954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.31598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Rate of return","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
