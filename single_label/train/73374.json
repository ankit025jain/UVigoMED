{"id":73374,"title":"Forearm soft tissue sarcoma: tumors characteristics and oncologic outcomes following limb salvage surgery.","abstract":"Complex anatomy of the forearm may impact on local control and survivals of soft tissue sarcoma. Little is known about characteristics and oncologic outcomes following surgical treatment.Demographic and tumor data of 117 patients with forearm soft tissue sarcoma were collected and analyzed. Following limb salvage, survivals, and prognostic factors were studied.Seventy-three patients were males (62%) and 53 (45%) were referred after unplanned excision. Pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma was most frequent (45%). The average tumor size was 5.1?cm and grade III histology was mostly identified (53%). With radiotherapy, local recurrence occurs in 8 patients (7%) and 30 patients (24%) developed metastasis. Overall survival, disease free survival, local recurrence free survival, and metastasis free survival were 83%, 74%, 93%, and 74%, respectively. Better survival was found for grade I (80% vs. 60%) and small size (<5?cm) (72% vs. 47%). Large size tumor, extra-compartmental site, extramuscular, and virgin tumor were positive predictors of metastasis.Soft tissue sarcomas of the forearm are often referred after unplanned excision. Limb salvage was achieved for most and local recurrence remained low in context of radiotherapy. Metastatic progression remained frequent. Low grade and small size were predictors of survival.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910319","annotations":[{"name":"Soft-tissue sarcoma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-tissue_sarcoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.476316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.114958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Virginity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginity"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"}]}
