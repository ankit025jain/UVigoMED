{"id":81290,"title":"Significance of buccopalatal implant position, biotype, platform switching, and pre-implant bone augmentation on the level of the midbuccal mucosa.","abstract":"This study assessed whether buccopalatal implant position, biotype, platform switching, and pre-implant bone augmentation affects the level of the midbuccal mucosa (MBM). Ninety patients with a single-tooth implant in the esthetic zone were included. The level of the MBM was measured on photographs taken 1 year after crown placement. The factors analyzed only explained 22% of the level of the MBM. The more an implant was placed to the buccal, the more the MBM was positioned apically. A comparable phenomenon was observed in cases with a thick biotype and cases that underwent pre-implant bone augmentation. Platform switching did not affect the level of the MBM.
