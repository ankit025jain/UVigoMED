{"id":83997,"title":"Body mass changes during long-duration spaceflight.","abstract":"During early spaceflights, many crewmembers did not meet their caloric requirements and consequently lost body mass during flight, as assessed by a decrease in postflight body mass. Maintaining body mass during spaceflight is crucial for maintaining crew health and monitoring body mass is thus important to medical operations as well as being a key component of human research. Determining body mass becomes difficult in a microgravity environment.We report data from two mass measurement devices on the International Space Station (ISS): the Russian body mass measuring device (BMMD), which uses spring oscillation physics, and NASA's Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device (SLAMMD), which uses Newton's second law of motion (F = ma).For 25 crewmembers whose body mass was measured on both devices, significant body mass loss occurred compared to preflight (gravimetric scale) and averaged -4.4% as assessed by BMMD and -2.8% as assessed by SLAMMD. After an initial loss in the first 30 d of flight, body mass remained constant through the rest of the mission, as determined using either device. The mean difference between the two devices was 1.1 kg when the closest SLAMMD and BMMD measurements were compared (6.9 Â± 6.2 d apart). Dietary intake during flight is approximately 80% of the World Health Organization estimated requirement and the decrease in body mass follows in-flight energy intake closely on average.Body mass monitoring is important for monitoring crew health during a mission and to help ensure that crewmembers consume adequate energy intake to mitigate the risks of spaceflight.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25197887","annotations":[{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.909068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Newton (unit)","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)"},{"name":"Newton's laws of motion","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.643986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.564819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Micro-g environment","weight":0.557486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-g_environment"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.547122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Flight","weight":0.533183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight"},{"name":"Weightlessness","weight":0.487964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Measuring instrument","weight":0.48373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_instrument"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.474575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Spaceflight","weight":0.412514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Second law of thermodynamics","weight":0.317115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.309578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Space station","weight":0.279473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station"},{"name":"Caloric theory","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.219606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Spring (device)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(device)"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Gravimetry","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimetry"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Rowing (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Missionary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
