{"id":56784,"title":"Treatment of neuromyelitis optica/neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders with methotrexate.","abstract":"To review our experience using methotrexate as a single long-term immunosuppressant (IS) therapy in neuromyelitis optica/neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMO/NMOSD).We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a diagnosis of NMO/NMOSD, supported by a positive NMO-IgG testing, who were treated with methotrexate. A paired sample 2 tailed t test was used to assess the annualized relapse rate during 18 months pre treatment with methotrexate to annualized relapse rate 18 months post treatment with methotrexate.We followed 9 patients meeting criteria for the study for a median of 62 months. All patients were stabilized during attacks with high-dose steroids and/or plasmapheresis. Five patients (55.55%) were started on methotrexate as an initial long-term immunosuppressant strategy. Three patients (33.33%) were initially treated with pulse cyclophosphamide followed by methotrexate as a preplanned step-down strategy. One patient was started on azathioprine prior to methotrexate. No patient had side effects requiring change in methotrexate therapy. Five patients (55.55%) had stabilization of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) on methotrexate. One patient had a small increase in EDSS due to concomitant illness. Three patients (33.33%) had methotrexate treatment failure evidenced by worsening EDSS and ongoing relapses while on methotrexate, mandating a change in methotrexate therapy. Average annualized relapse rate in the entire group comparing 18 months prior versus 18 months after methotrexate treatment was reduced by an absolute value of 64% (3.11 vs 1.11). A paired t-test showed this reduction was highly significant (p?=?.009).In our experience, methotrexate is safe and possibly efficacious as a single long-term IS therapy along with low dose corticosteroids that can reasonably be offered to patients with NMO/NMOSD.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628894","annotations":[{"name":"Plasmapheresis","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Azathioprine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.890853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.75769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Expanded Disability Status Scale","weight":0.640374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_Disability_Status_Scale"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.611652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.545484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.532167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.349689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.172032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0369874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Absolute value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Somnambulist (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnambulist_(Angel)"}]}
