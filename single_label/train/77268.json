{"id":77268,"title":"Prevention and anthropology.","abstract":"Screening is an important issue in medicine and is used to early identify unrecognised diseases in persons who are apparently in good health. Screening strongly relies on the concept of \"normal values\". Normal values are defined as values that are frequently observed in a population and usually range within certain statistical limits. Screening for obesity should start early as the prevalence of obesity consolidates already at early school age. Though widely practiced, measuring BMI is not the ultimate solution for detecting obesity. Children with high BMI may be \"robust\" in skeletal dimensions. Assessing skeletal robustness and in particularly assessing developmental tempo in adolescents are also important issues in health screening. Yet, in spite of the necessity of screening investigations, appropriate reference values are often missing. Meanwhile, new concepts of growth diagrams have been developed. Stage line diagrams are useful for tracking developmental processes over time. Functional data analyses have efficiently been used for analysing longitudinal growth in height and assessing the tempo of maturation. Convenient low-cost statistics have also been developed for generating synthetic national references.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818444","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Anthropology","weight":0.768317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.448141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.38698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.35754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"School","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.17282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.122128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0878161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.078616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.0424438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Diagram","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Reference ranges for blood tests","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests"},{"name":"List of states with limited recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition"},{"name":"Early Buddhist schools","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Buddhist_schools"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Reference range","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_range"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Erikson's stages of psychosocial development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson's_stages_of_psychosocial_development"},{"name":"Marriage of convenience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_of_convenience"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Tempo","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo"}]}
