{"id":76290,"title":"[The influence of cytoflavin and cardioxipin on the indices of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant protection in the blood of rat with dyslipidemia].","abstract":"Comparative tests on nonlinear rats of both sex with model violation of lipid metabolism have been performed in order to study the effects of cytoflavin (1.75 ml/kg or 175 mg/kg with respect to succinic acid) and cardioxipin (52.5 mg/kg) on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant protection indices in the blood. It is established that these preparations cause a decrease in the content of malonic dialdehyde (MDA) in erythrocytes that results in increased antioxidant activity and lipid reserves for peroxidation in the blood.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102732","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.796984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.492399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Aldehyde","weight":0.492289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.440368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Malonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malonic_acid"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"}]}
