{"id":50407,"title":"[Neuro-critical management of glycemia in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: review of the literature].","abstract":"Spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage or intracranial hemorrhage represents between 10 and 15% of all cerebrovascular events. Intracerebral hemorrhage is far less frequent than ischemic stroke, but leads to increased morbidity and mortality, one of the leading causes of severe disability. Several changes have been identified in the field of intracerebral hemorrhage, including endocrine. These stress-mediated mechanisms exacerbate secondary injury. Deep knowledge of the injuries that are directly involved in the alterations of glucose in the context of an intracerebral hemorrhage, offers a vision of how the cytotoxicity, neuronal death and metabolic disturbances alter the prognosis of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791369","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral hemorrhage","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Intracranial hemorrhage","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.719073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.585444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.446084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Primary and secondary brain injury","weight":0.232625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_and_secondary_brain_injury"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
