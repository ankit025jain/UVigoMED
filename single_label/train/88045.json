{"id":88045,"title":"[Value of focused critical ultrasound in the treatment of critical patients in Lushan earthquake].","abstract":"To explore the value of focused critical ultrasound in the treatment of critical patients in Lushan earthquake.The utilization of bedside ultrasound and its effects on the treatment of critical patients in Lushan earthquake were retrospectively analyzed.After brief training of resident doctors, bedside ultrasound was performed for 107 sessions. And 97 sessions (90.7%) of ultrasound exams were valuable for diagnosis and treatment. The exams included hemodynamic monitoring for 44 sessions and bedside lung ultrasound for 58 sessions. In hemodynamic monitoring, after heart function estimation, fluid resuscitation was restarted in 8 cases (8/44, 18.2%) and terminated in 2 cases to control risks. False estimate of volume by clinical experience were 8 sessions (8/44, 18.2%). And corrections were made after ultrasound exams. A total of 18 cases (18/44, 40.9%) of hemodynamic treatments improved with the help of focused critical ultrasound. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed to monitor the change of lung water in fluid resuscitation 6 sessions and guide the pleural fluid drainage and lung recruitment before weaning 17 sessions; the BLUE-plus lung ultrasound protocol was performed for 32 sessions. And 24 cases of lung consolidation and atelectasis were found. Chest physiotherapy was then performed. The focused critical ultrasound exam was also performed to locate thrombus, biliary infection and intracranial infection, etc.Focused critical ultrasound can provide reliable clinical information to reduce unnecessary examination and optimize therapies for Lushan earthquake victims.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924709","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Atelectasis","weight":0.794754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelectasis"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.608726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.54584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.379473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.300502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.236682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Chest physiotherapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_physiotherapy"},{"name":"Pulmonary consolidation","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_consolidation"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"}]}
