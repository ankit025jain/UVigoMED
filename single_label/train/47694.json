{"id":47694,"title":"Predictive factors for the sensitivity of radiotherapy and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"To identify predictive biomarkers for radiosensitization and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).A total of 150 advanced stage ESCC patients were treated with preoperative radiotherapy. The protein levels of Dicer 1, DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the mRNA levels of Dicer 1, Dnmt1, and let-7b microRNA (miRNA) were measured in ESCC tumor tissues before and after radiotherapy. Global DNA methylation was measured and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed.Negative Dicer 1, Dnmt1, and DNA-PKcs protein expression were observed in 72%, 67.3%, and 50.7% of ESCC patients, respectively. Primary Dicer 1 and Dnmt1 expression positively correlated with radiation sensitization and longer survival of ESCC patients, while increased Dicer 1 and Dnmt1 expression after radiation correlated with increased apoptosis in residual tumor tissues. Dicer 1 and Dnmt1 expression correlated with let-7b miRNA expression and global DNA methylation levels, respectively. In contrast, positive DNA-PKcs expression negatively correlated with radiation-induced pathological reactions, and increased DNA-PKcs expression correlated with increased apoptosis after radiation.Global DNA hypomethylation and low miRNA expression are involved in the sensitization of ESCC to radiotherapy and prognosis of patients with ESCC.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576011","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Transferase","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferase"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"DNA methyltransferase","weight":0.749281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.532844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.468416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.416645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Methyltransferase","weight":0.209809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyltransferase"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.201841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Dicer","weight":0.191559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicer"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.184002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_deoxynucleotidyl_transferase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"}]}
