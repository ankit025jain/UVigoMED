{"id":32575,"title":"Percutaneous retrieval and redeployment of an atrial septal occluder under three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic guidance: a case report.","abstract":"Percutaneous device closure for secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs) has been performed commonly and safely with high success rates. However, it is still challenging to close ASDs that are surrounded with deficient or hypermobile rims and could be compromised with an unexpected migration of device. We report a case of percutaneous Amplazter Septal Occluder (ASO; St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul, Minnesota, USA) device closure for an ASD with a thin and floppy interatrial septum, which immediately migrated into the right atrium and was not pulled back into the delivery sheath. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a successful percutaneous retrieval and redeployment of the device in such a situation, preventing any vascular injury or unplanned emergency open heart surgery.
