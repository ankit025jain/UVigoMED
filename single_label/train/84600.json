{"id":84600,"title":"Roles for Pbp1 and caloric restriction in genome and lifespan maintenance via suppression of RNA-DNA hybrids.","abstract":"Intergenic transcription within repetitive loci such as the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats of yeast commonly triggers aberrant recombination. Major mechanisms suppressing aberrant rDNA recombination rely on chromatin silencing or RNAPII repression at intergenic spacers within the repeats. We find ancient processes operating at rDNA intergenic spacers and other loci to maintain genome stability via repression of RNA-DNA hybrids. The yeast Ataxin-2 protein Pbp1 binds noncoding RNA, suppresses RNA-DNA hybrids, and prevents aberrant rDNA recombination. Repression of RNA-DNA hybrids in Pbp1-deficient cells through RNaseH overexpression, deletion of the G4DNA-stabilizing Stm1, or caloric restriction operating via RNaseH/Pif1 restores rDNA stability. Pbp1 also limits hybrids at non-rDNA G4DNA loci including telomeres. Moreover, cells lacking Pbp1 have a short replicative lifespan that is extended upon hybrid suppression. Thus, we find roles for Pbp1 in genome maintenance and reveal that caloric restriction counteracts Pbp1 deficiencies by engaging RNaseH and Pif1.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073155","annotations":[{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.857399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.837699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chromatin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Calorie restriction","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Intergenic region","weight":0.740171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergenic_region"},{"name":"Telomere","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.571261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.47953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.311358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.297724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Ancient history","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"}]}
