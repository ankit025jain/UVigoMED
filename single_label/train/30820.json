{"id":30820,"title":"Attenuation of ethanol withdrawal by ceftriaxone-induced upregulation of glutamate transporter EAAT2.","abstract":"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a potentially fatal outcome of severe alcohol dependence that presents a significant challenge to treatment. Although AWS is thought to be driven by a hyperglutamatergic brain state, benzodiazepines, which target the GABAergic system, comprise the first line of treatment for AWS. Using a rat model of ethanol withdrawal, we tested whether ceftriaxone, a ?-lactam antibiotic known to increase the expression and activity of glutamate uptake transporter EAAT2, reduces the occurrence or severity of ethanol withdrawal manifestations. After a 2-week period of habituation to ethanol in two-bottle choice, alcohol-preferring (P) and Wistar rats received ethanol (4.0 g/kg) every 6 h for 3-5 consecutive days via gavage. Rats were then deprived of ethanol for 48 h during which time they received ceftriaxone (50 or 100 mg/kg, IP) or saline twice a day starting 12 h after the last ethanol administration. Withdrawal manifestations were captured by continuous video recording and coded. The evolution of ethanol withdrawal was markedly different for P rats vs Wistar rats, with withdrawal manifestations occurring >12 h later in P rats than in Wistar rats. Ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg per injection twice per day (200 mg/kg/day) reduced or abolished all manifestations of ethanol withdrawal in both rat variants and prevented withdrawal-induced escalation of alcohol intake. Finally, ceftriaxone treatment was associated with lasting upregulation of ethanol withdrawal-induced downregulation of EAAT2 in the striatum. Our data support the role of ceftriaxone in alleviating alcohol withdrawal and open a novel pharmacologic avenue that requires clinical evaluation in patients with AWS.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452391","annotations":[{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.747632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.25501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Excitatory amino-acid transporter","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_amino-acid_transporter"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.129577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.0805107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Ceftriaxone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Lactam","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
