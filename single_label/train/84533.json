{"id":84533,"title":"Biomechanical analysis of anterior versus posterior instrumentation following a thoracolumbar corpectomy: Laboratory investigation.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical properties of lateral instrumentation compared with short- and long-segment pedicle screw constructs following an L-1 corpectomy and reconstruction with an expandable cage.Eight human cadaveric T10-L4 spines underwent an L-1 corpectomy followed by placement of an expandable cage. The spines then underwent placement of lateral instrumentation consisting of 4 monoaxial screws and 2 rods with 2 cross-connectors, short-segment pedicle screw fixation involving 1 level above and below the corpectomy, and long-segment pedicle screw fixation (2 levels above and below). The order of instrumentation was randomized in the 8 specimens. Testing was conducted for each fixation technique. The spines were tested with a pure moment of 6 Nm in all 6 degrees of freedom (flexion, extension, right and left lateral bending, and right and left axial rotation).In flexion, extension, and left/right lateral bending, posterior long-segment instrumentation had significantly less motion compared with the intact state. Additionally, posterior long-segment instrumentation was significantly more rigid than short-segment and lateral instrumentation in flexion, extension, and left/right lateral bending. In axial rotation, the posterior long-segment construct as well as lateral instrumentation were not significantly more rigid than the intact state. The posterior long-segment construct was the most rigid in all 6 degrees of freedom.In the setting of highly unstable fractures requiring anterior reconstruction, and involving all 3 columns, long-segment posterior pedicle screw constructs are the most rigid.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25084029","annotations":[{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.601083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.550058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.540941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.413243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.409085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.120905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.11872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Barcelona Metro line 4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_4"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Rod cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Instrumentation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(music)"},{"name":"International Committee for Information Technology Standards","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Information_Technology_Standards"},{"name":"Cage (enclosure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(enclosure)"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Free will","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
