{"id":45526,"title":"Electrocautery for ESD: settings of the electrical surgical unit VIO300D.","abstract":"An electrical surgical unit (ESU) performs incisions and coagulation through applying Joule heat, generated by a high-frequency current onto tissue without neuromuscular stimulation. Output by the ESU includes incision output and coagulation output. Incision output is needed to generate a steam explosion (spark) by quickly increasing the intracellular fluid temperature through continuous application of Joule heat generated by the high-frequency current (unmodulated pulse: continuous wave). To perform safe and successful endoscopic submucosal dissection, one must fully understand the principles and features of an ESU to use settings that match the device and to adjust the settings appropriately for each situation.
