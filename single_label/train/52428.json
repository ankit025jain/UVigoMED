{"id":52428,"title":"Effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and ileal transposition surgeries on glucose and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle and liver.","abstract":"Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and ileal transposition (IT) surgeries produce weight loss and improve diabetic control; however, the mechanisms of glycemic improvements are largely unknown. Because skeletal muscle and liver play a key role in glucose homeostasis, we compared the effects of RYGB and IT surgeries on key molecules of glucose and lipid metabolism in muscle and liver.Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to RYGB, IT, or sham surgeries; sham-animals were ad-lib fed or pair-fed to RYGB rats (n = 7-9/group). At 8 weeks postoperatively, blood samples were collected for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and insulin analyses by ELISA. Leg muscle and liver tissues were analyzed for mRNA (RT-qPCR) and/or protein abundance (immuno blotting) of important molecules of glucose and lipid metabolism [glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4), hexokinase, phosphofructokinase (PFK), adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase-? (AMPK?), cytochrome C oxidase-IV (COX-IV), citrate synthase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 ? (PGC-1 ?), PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC), uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3)].Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were increased comparably with RYGB and IT. RYGB and IT increased muscle GLUT-4 protein content, muscle hexokinase mRNA, and liver PFK mRNA. IT increased muscle AMPK? and COX-IV protein content and liver citrate synthase activity. IT increased muscle CPT-1, MCAD and PRC mRNA, whereas RYGB increased UCP-3 mRNA in muscle and liver, and PGC-1 ? mRNA in liver.The data suggest that RYGB and IT surgeries lead to enhanced GLP-1 secretion and produce similar stimulatory effects on important molecules of glucose metabolism but differential effects on key molecules of lipid oxidation in muscle and liver.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Endocrine System
