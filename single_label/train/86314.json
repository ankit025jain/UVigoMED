{"id":86314,"title":"Asthma drug ratios and exacerbations: claims data from universal health coverage systems.","abstract":"In claims data, controller-to-total asthma drug ratios may reflect adequacy of disease management. We verified whether asthma patients with high ratios (? 50%) experienced fewer asthma-related outcomes. Two ratios were studied: that of the inhaled corticosteroids to total asthma drug (ICS/R03) and that of the inhaled corticosteroids plus leukotriene antagonist receptors-to-total asthma drug (ICS+LTRA/R03). Patients aged 13-40 years, with ? 3 respiratory drugs dispensed prescriptions in 2005 were selected from the French national claims data. After excluding null ratios, two groups were defined according to ratio values in 2007: low-ratio group (0% < ratio < 50%) and high-ratio group (ratio ? 50%). For both ratios, asthma-related outcomes and medical-resource utilisation were compared between groups. Of 2162 patients (mean age 27 years and 52% female), patients with non-null ratios were 81% and 85% for ICS/R03 and ICS+LTRA/R03 ratios, respectively. Patients with high ratios were less likely to receive oral corticosteroids than those in the low-ratio group (relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.72-0.88, and 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.88, for ICS/R03 and ICS+LTRA/R03, respectively). High ratio groups also presented fewer asthma-related hospitalisations. Significant negative correlations were also observed for both ratios, when studied quantitatively, according to patients' dispensed level of oral corticosteroids in 2007. In claims data, both ICS/R03 and ICS+LTRA/R03 ? 50% were related to fewer asthma-related outcomes. Ratios should be explored to identify asthma patients at risk of exacerbations. Low ratios can be considered as risk factors of exacerbation whatever the underlying cause.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789951","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.453116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.434238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.402309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.374132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.256263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.231041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"Leukotriene","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene"},{"name":"France","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Leukotriene antagonist","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene_antagonist"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"1340","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1340"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"2160s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2160s"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Utilisation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisation"},{"name":"Asthma medication","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma_medication"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_Centre_for_the_Study_of_Radicalisation_and_Political_Violence"},{"name":"Disease management (health)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_management_(health)"}]}
