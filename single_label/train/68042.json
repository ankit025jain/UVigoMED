{"id":68042,"title":"[Salvage therapy for castration-refractory prostate cancer resistant to docetaxel].","abstract":"To evaluate the treatment for castration-refractory prostate cancer (CRPC) resistant to docetaxelAmong 45 patients with CRPC treated with docetaxel (70-75 mg/m2) every 3 to 4 weeks at Hamamatsu University Hospital from January 2004 to July 2012, 19 patients underwent salvage treatments. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 14 patients except for 5 patients who were enrolled in clinical trials.The median age and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at starting salvage treatments was 71 years (range 45 to 79) and 241.1 ng/mL (range 3.06 to 1,643.0), respectively. All patients maintained castration status. Salvage treatments include DTX (30 mg/m2) + cisplatin (CDDP) (70 mg/m2)/carboplatin (Area under the curve = 4), etoposide + CDDP, paclitaxel + CDDP, cyclophosphamide, S-l, tegaful-uracil. The reasons why 14 patients moved to salvage treatments after DTX were progressive disease in 12 patients and adverse events in 2. Eight patients had a PSA response, 3 patients>50% and 5 patients<50%. Six patients had a PSA progression. The median overall survival was 10.4 months (range 4.1 to 27.3). All patients died of cancer, 13 patients with prostate cancer and one patient with lung adenocarcinoma. Most adverse events were mild. Transitory grade 3 leukopenia was observed in 2 patients, and grade 3 anemia in 2. No grade 4 toxicities were noted.All salvage treatments without grade 4 toxicities described in this study may be acceptable in the patients with CRPC progressing after docetaxel although the effect would be limited.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564074","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Carboplatin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboplatin"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Salvage therapy","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvage_therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.67551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.635916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.622545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.556281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.442888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.338524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.311335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
