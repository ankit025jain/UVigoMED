{"id":46139,"title":"Saline-enhanced ultrasonography: prediction of X-ray appearance of hepatic venography in patients with cirrhosis.","abstract":"To examine the efficacy of saline-enhanced ultrasound (US) in predicting the X-ray appearance of hepatic venography.This prospective study consisted of 50 cirrhosis patients (31 males and 19 females; mean age, 64.2Â±11.1 years). US patterns in the liver, after injection of agitated saline via balloon-occluded catheter, were evaluated with respect to the findings of CO2-enhanced hepatic venogram.US demonstrated two patterns: type I showing positive parenchymal enhancement (40 patients) and type II showing negative parenchymal enhancement with detection of hepatic vein (10 patients). There were also two patterns shown by hepatic venography: type A showing retrograde detection of intrahepatic portal vein (41 patients) and type B showing hepatic venous enhancement via intrahepatic venous-venous communications with no detection of intrahepatic portal vein (9 patients). All patients with type I showed retrograde detection of intrahepatic portal vein via hepatic sinusoid on X-ray venograms (type A). Of the 10 patients with type II, nine showed type B and one showed type A. Sensitivity and specificity of type I US pattern to predict the detection of intrahepatic portal vein on the venogram were 100% and 90%, respectively. There was no significant difference in hepatic venous pressure gradient or wedged hepatic venous pressure between patients with type I and type II.Saline-enhanced US is effective in predicting the findings of hepatic venogram. As type II strongly suggests the shunt-modified venogram, image taking in these cases would be superfluous with the added advantage of avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646346","annotations":[{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.82417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.777392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.647042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.607899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.600638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hepatic vein","weight":0.402244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_vein"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.351758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Venography","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venography"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Sine wave","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.104145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Liver sinusoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_sinusoid"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Telecommunication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"}]}
