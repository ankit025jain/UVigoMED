{"id":69544,"title":"[Optimization of an approach to solving the problem of a barren marriage in secretory azoospermic men].","abstract":"To compare the efficiency of using different interventional procedures for a barren marriage in case of secretory azoospermia (SAS).The trial enrolled 110 patients aged 25 to 54 years with SAS. The levels of sexual hormones were determined; ovarian punch biopsy was performed.Decreased volume of the ovaries was noted in 85.3% of the patients; diffuse or focal changes in their parenchyma were seen in 65.7%. There was an increase of follicle-stimulating hormone levels and a reduction in testosterone ones. Hyperestrogenemia was identified in 26.5% of the patients. The level of inhibin B was lower in all the patients. The efficiency of standard testicular sperm extraction for cryopreservation was achieved in 28.7% of the patients and that of a microsurgical technique was in 56.7%. The wives of 37 out of the 57 patients included in an assisted reproductive technology program were more than 12 weeks pregnant after 95 intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles.The microsurgical technique is most effective in achieving the successful treatment of patients with azoospermia in order to prevent male infertility.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437221","annotations":[{"name":"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection"},{"name":"Azoospermia","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azoospermia"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.862063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Cryopreservation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation"},{"name":"Male infertility","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Activin and inhibin","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activin_and_inhibin"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.38647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Testicular sperm extraction","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_sperm_extraction"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Polygamy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"}]}
