{"id":51675,"title":"Changes in HbA1c level over a 12-week follow-up in patients with type 2 diabetes following a medication change.","abstract":"Current guidance about the interval needed before retesting HbA1c when monitoring for glycaemic control is based on expert opinion rather than well-powered studies. The aim of our work was to explore how fast HbA1c changes after a change in glucose-lowering medication. This has implications for whether routine HbA1c testing intervals before 12 weeks could inform diabetes medication adjustments.This 12-week cohort study recruited patients from 18 general practices in the United Kingdom with non-insulin treated diabetes who were initiating or changing dose of oral glucose-lowering medication. HbA1c was measured at baseline and 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after recruitment. HbA1c levels at earlier time intervals were correlated with 12-week HbA1c. A ROC curve analysis was used to identify the 8-week threshold above which medication adjustment may be clinically appropriate.Ninety-three patients were recruited to the study. Seventy-nine patients with no change in medication and full 12-week follow-up had the following baseline characteristics: mean ± standard deviation age of 61.3 ± 10.8 years, 34% were female and diabetes duration of 6.0 ± 4.3 years. Mean HbA1c at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks was 8.7 ± 1.5%, (72.0 ± 16.8 mmol/mol) 8.6 ± 1.6% (70.7 ± 17.0 mmol/mol), 8.4 ± 1.5% (68.7 ± 15.9 mmol/mol), 8.2 ± 1.4% (66.3 ± 15.8 mmol/mol) and 8.1 ± 1.4% (64.8 ± 15.7 mmol/mol) respectively. At the end of the study 61% of patients had sub-optimal glycaemic control (HbA1c>7.5% or 59 mmol/mol). The 8-week change correlated significantly with the 12-week change in HbA1c and an HbA1c above 8.2% (66 mmol/mol) at 8 weeks correctly classified all 28 patients who had not achieved glycaemic control by 12 weeks.This is the first study designed with sufficient power to examine short-term changes in HbA1c. The 12-week change in HbA1c can be predicted 8 weeks after a medication change. Many participants who had not achieved glycaemic control after 12 weeks may have benefitted from an earlier review of their HbA1c and medication.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667212","annotations":[{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.874293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.763039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.469411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.276029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.241348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.0945851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Expert witness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"C (musical note)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(musical_note)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"},{"name":"Threshold model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
