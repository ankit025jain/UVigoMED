{"id":42488,"title":"Colorectal advanced neoplasms occur through dual carcinogenesis pathways in individuals with coexisting serrated polyps.","abstract":"Individuals with serrated polyps (SP) are at higher risk for synchronous colorectal advanced neoplasms (AN) and cancers. However, it remains unclear whether there is a unique involvement of the serrated pathway and/or the classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence in this setting.Colorectal ANs, which include tubular adenomas ? 10 mm, adenomas with villous histology, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasms, and cancers, were collected retrospectively. The groups included ANs with (AN+SP) or without (AN-only) coexisting SPs. Clinicopathological findings were compared between groups. BRAF and KRAS mutations in ANs and SPs, and methylation levels at long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) in adjacent mucosa were determined by pyrosequencing.Seventy-five ANs from 40 patients in the AN+SP group, and 179 ANs from 119 patients in the AN-only group were analyzed. There were no significant differences in clinicopathological findings between the two groups, except that intraepithelial neoplasia in the AN+SP group was more likely to be located in the right colon (P=0.018). BRAF mutations were significantly more frequent in the AN+SP group (P=0.003), while KRAS mutations showed no significant differences between groups (P=0.142). The majority of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasms in both groups showed a contiguous component of conventional adenoma. Individuals with large and right-sided SPs had significantly more conventional adenomas compared to those without such SPs (P=0.027 and P=0.031, respectively). Adjacent mucosa from individuals with multiple and large SPs showed significantly lower methylation levels at LINE-1 compared to individuals without such associated SPs (P=0.049 and P=0.015, respectively).Our data suggest that both the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and the serrated pathway are operational in individuals with coexisting ANs and SPs. The reduced methylation levels at LINE-1 in the background mucosa suggest the possibility of an underlying 'field defect'.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24849572","annotations":[{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.864186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.774507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.763352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.736231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.439674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Intestinal villus","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_villus"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Shore patrol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore_patrol"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Retrotransposon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"},{"name":"Anguttara Nikaya","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguttara_Nikaya"},{"name":"Contiguity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguity"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
