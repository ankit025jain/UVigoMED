{"id":32180,"title":"Linkage mapping and whole exome sequencing identify a shared variant in CX3CR1 in a large multi-generation family.","abstract":"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a crippling condition that affects children and adults, with an average incidence of 1-1.5 cases per 1000 live births. It results in disabling arthritis of the hip in up to 60% patients in the 20-40 year age group. There is no accurate diagnostic test available for newborns. The purpose of our study is to develop a sensitive and specific genetic test for DDH by identifying causative mutations. Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing of 4 severely affected individuals of a 4 generation 71 member family was performed. The damaging rs3732378 variant in the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor was shared by all affected family members and by 15% of 28 sporadic dysplastics.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998320","annotations":[{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.933358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.80405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.617754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"CX3CR1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CX3CR1"},{"name":"3CR","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3CR"},{"name":"Exome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome"},{"name":"Chemokine receptor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine_receptor"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"2040","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2040"},{"name":"Complement receptor 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_receptor_1"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"}]}
