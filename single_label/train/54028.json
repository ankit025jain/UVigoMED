{"id":54028,"title":"[Differentiated thyroid cancer: an ancient disease with new knowledge].","abstract":"Differentiated thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and its incidence appears to be rising rapidly with a good prognosis. However, the involvement of different medical specialties has changed the focus of treatment and triggered a number of controversies. In the absence of controlled trials, the guidelines for treatment are founded on prognostic factors for survival and local control, the effects of the treatments, and comorbidities. Recently, the major advances in the field of genetics and molecular biology have been applied in the treatment of iodine refractory disease, and the use of tracers and recombinant hormones have succeeded in improving adjuvant treatment. Based on this information, we present this review with the aim of updating the knowledge of an ancient disease.
