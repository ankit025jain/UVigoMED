{"id":43858,"title":"Genotype CC of rs1800947 in the C-reactive protein gene may increase susceptibility to colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Single nucleotide polymorphisms of C-reactive protein (CRP) have been shown to be related to circulating CRP level, risk and prognosis in cancer patients. However, accumulating evidence of rs1800947 involvement in risk of cancer is inconsistent. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to obtain a more precise relationship.The pooled odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval were assessed in 10 eligible articles with 12 studies containing 5,601 cancer cases and 8,669 cancer-free controls.No significant association was observed overall and in subgroups in comparison of genotype GC vs GG (PH=0.847, OR=0.939, 95%CI=0.810-1.087), GC/CC vs GG (PH=0.941, OR=1.021, 95%CI=0.901-1.157) and allele C vs G (PH=0.933, OR=1.026, 95%CI=0.909-1.159). However, statistically significance was evident in comparison of genotype CC vs GG in cancer risk (PH=0.586, OR=2.854, 95%CI= 1.413-5.763), especially in colorectal cancer (PH=0.481, OR=4.527, 95%CI= 1.664- 12.315).Genotype CC of rs1800947 in the CRP gene is strongly associated with increased cancer risk, particularly in colorectal cancer.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761881","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.9065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.810292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.591853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.584875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.354832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.314018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.265311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.210311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"847","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/847"},{"name":"763","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/763"},{"name":"527","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/527"},{"name":"854","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/854"},{"name":"939","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/939"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"933","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/933"},{"name":"941","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/941"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
