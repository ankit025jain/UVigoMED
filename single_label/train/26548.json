{"id":26548,"title":"A polypill strategy to improve global secondary cardiovascular prevention: from concept to reality.","abstract":"The prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by using a polypill has gained increasing momentum as a strategy to contain progression of the disease. Since its initial conception just over a decade ago, only a handful of trials have been completed assessing the efficacy and safety of this innovative concept. The results of these trials have supported the viability of the polypill in CVD prevention and management, albeit with a few caveats, essentially related to the lack of evidence on the effect of the polypill to effectively reduce cardiovascular events. The polypill has the potential to control the global health epidemic of CVD by effectively reaching underdeveloped regions of the world, simplifying healthcare delivery, improving cost-effectiveness, increasing medication adherence, and supporting a comprehensive prescription of evidence-based cardioprotective drugs. Major trials underway will provide definitive evidence on the efficacy of the polypill in reducing cardiovascular events in a cost-effective manner. The results of these studies will determine whether a polypill strategy can quell the burgeoning public health challenge of CVD and will potentially provide the evidence to implement an effective, simple, and innovative solution to restrain the global CVD pandemic.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25104532","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.793617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.723581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.664316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.582909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Global health","weight":0.564344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.525419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.274844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Human Development Index","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index"},{"name":"Polypill","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypill"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Momentum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
