{"id":85335,"title":"Plasma connective tissue growth factor levels as potential biomarkers of airway obstruction in patients with asthma.","abstract":"Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness and airflow limitation. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), one of the key profibrotic factors associated with transforming growth factor ?, may be related to airway remodeling in asthma. However, no data are available on the association between plasma CTGF levels and clinical and physiologic parameters in patients with asthma. Recently, we developed a novel subtraction method for determination of plasma CTGF levels.To investigate the utility of plasma CTGF level as a surrogate biomarker in asthma.Plasma CTGF levels were measured in 67 patients with stable asthma and 81 healthy volunteers, using the subtraction method. We evaluated correlations between plasma CTGF levels and clinical and physiologic parameters in patients with asthma.Plasma CTGF levels were higher in patients with asthma than in healthy volunteers. Asthmatic patients with a percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than 80% had significantly higher levels of plasma CTGF than those with a percentage of predicted FEV1 of 80% or more. In patients with asthma, plasma CTGF levels had significantly negative correlations with forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, percentage of predicted FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, forced expiratory flow at 50% of the FVC (FEF50%), percentage of predicted FEF50%, forced expiratory flow at 75% of the FVC (FEF75%), and percentage of predicted FEF75%, parameters that reflect the degree of airway obstruction. Plasma CTGF levels were negatively correlated with Asthma Control Test scores, a patient-based index of clinical control of asthma.Plasma CTGF may be a potential biomarker for stable asthma when evaluating the degree of persistent airway obstruction.umin.ac.jp/ctr Identifier: UMIN000013081.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973271","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.902441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.786174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.558538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.521813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.394055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.363449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.231345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Airway obstruction","weight":0.227954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.148497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"CTGF","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTGF"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Aerodynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Ecuadorian Football Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuadorian_Football_Federation"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Subtraction","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Identifier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"}]}
