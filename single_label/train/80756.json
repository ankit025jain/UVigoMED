{"id":80756,"title":"Comparison of experimental hut entrance and exit behavior between Anopheles darlingi from the Cayo District, Belize, and Zungarococha, Peru.","abstract":"Anopheles darlingi is a major vector for malaria in Central and South America. Behavioral, ecological, genetic, and morphologic variability has been observed across its wide distribution. Recent studies have documented that 2 distinct genotypes exist for An. darlingi: a northern lineage (Belize, Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama) and a southern lineage (Amazonia and southern Brazil). In order to determine if these genotypes exhibited different behavioral traits, entrance and exit movement patterns between 2 field populations of An. darlingi that represented each genotype were evaluated using experimental huts. The Belize population exhibited bimodal entrance, with peak entry occurring between 7:00-8:00 p.m. and 5:00-6:00 a.m. and peak exiting occurring between 7:00-8:00 p.m. The Peru population exhibited unimodal entrance, with peak entry occurring between 10:00-11:00 p.m. and peak exiting occurring between 11:00-12:00 a.m. with a secondary smaller peak at 2:30 a.m. Entrance and exit behavioral patterns were significantly different between the Belize and Peru populations of An. darlingi (log-rank [Mantel-Cox] P < 0.001). Information from the present study will be used in the future to determine if there is a correlation between genotype and host-seeking behavior and can be used in the present for regional vector risk assessment.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551964","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.920564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Belize","weight":0.883263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize"},{"name":"Venezuela","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela"},{"name":"Peru","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru"},{"name":"Guatemala","weight":0.810201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Panama","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama"},{"name":"Amazon Rainforest","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.686764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.671238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Latin America","weight":0.651766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.651464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.45654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.374575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.341325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.290671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.169228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cayo District","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayo_District"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"South Region, Brazil","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Hut (dwelling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_(dwelling)"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"}]}
