{"id":72087,"title":"Tumor-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).","abstract":"The concept to exploit death receptors for cancer therapy is very attractive, since these cell surface receptors have a direct connection to the intracellular cell death machinery. Among the death receptor superfamily, the tumor-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor/ligand system is of special interest. TRAIL receptor agonists have recently entered the stage of clinical evaluation for the treatment of human cancers. Further insights into the regulatory mechanisms of TRAIL signaling will help to better understand the determinants of TRAIL sensitivity versus resistance of human cancers.
