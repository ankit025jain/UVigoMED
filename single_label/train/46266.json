{"id":46266,"title":"Diagnosis of liver cancer from blood sera using FTIR microspectroscopy: a preliminary study.","abstract":"FTIR microspectroscopy was applied for studying macromolecular changes in human serum samples from patients with healthy livers, and those diagnosed with liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study demonstrated that the serum samples from HCC and cirrhotic patients could readily be discriminated from those from healthy controls based on macromolecular differences related to their lipid and protein structure. Spectral changes appeared to indicate that the secondary structure of protein from HCC sample groups contained a more distinctive ? -sheet structure and a lower lipid content compared to samples from the healthy and cirrhosis group. This was correlated with measurements of large decreases in albumin levels in serum from diseased patients. We argue that this technique shows potential as a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and non-subjective methodology for the screening patients suspected of liver disease.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639420","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.741258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Macromolecule","weight":0.721046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Protein structure","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.465642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.4614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.316339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.199958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"}]}
