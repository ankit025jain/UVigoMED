{"id":85905,"title":"Development of an immunochromatographic kit for rapid detection of human influenza B virus infection.","abstract":"Type B influenza virus is a major epidemic strain responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity.A colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip for the rapid detection of human influenza B virus was developed. This test is based on membrane chromatography and uses colloidal gold conjugated with influenza B virus anti-NP monoclonal antibody as the tracer. The assembled test strip was housed in a plastic case.The colloid gold strip (CGS) specifically detected all influenza B viruses tested and did not react with other respiratory viruses. Compared with SYBR Green real-time PCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the CGS test was 89.76% and 99.56%, respectively, and the consistency ratio between CGS and real-time PCR was 96.06% in detecting influenza B virus in 710 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with influenza-like illness in the hospital.The CGS array developed in this study enabled typing of influenza B viruses in human clinical specimens. Thus, together with the advantages of rapid detection and easy operation without requiring specialized personnel and equipment, this technique is a convenient and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tool for large-scale screening of clinical samples.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839825","annotations":[{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Influenzavirus B","weight":0.730688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenzavirus_B"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.71617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.684931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.555951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.489986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.32596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Human flu","weight":0.27107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_flu"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0994886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Colloidal gold","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold"},{"name":"SYBR Green I","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYBR_Green_I"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
