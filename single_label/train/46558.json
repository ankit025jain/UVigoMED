{"id":46558,"title":"Paediatric celiac patients carrying the HLA-DR7-DQ2 and HLA-DR3-DQ2 haplotypes display small clinical differences.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the relevance of HLA-DR7-DQ2 typing in a prospective cohort of paediatric coeliac disease patients from Southern Europe.This cross-sectional study tested 249 paediatric patients with coeliac disease. HLA-DR3-DQ2 was typed in combination with HLA-DR7-DQ2 to screen for the HLA-DQ2 haplotype. The histological, analytical and clinical characteristics of the subjects were recorded.A total of 91 coeliac patients were diagnosed: 96.7% carried HLA-DQ2 and 4.4% carried HLA-DQ8. In percentage terms, 80.2% of patients carried HLA-DR3-DQ2 and 34.1% carried HLA-DR7-DQ2. We did not find significant differences between HLA-DR7-DQ2 and HLA-DR3-DQ2 paediatric patients with respect to histological damage and clinical characteristics, except for irritability and weight loss. These characteristics were more frequent in HLA-DQ2trans than in HLA-DQ2cis (22.2% vs. 0.0% [p = 0.035] and 55.6% vs. 21.4% [p = 0.017], respectively). Coeliac-specific autoantibody levels were higher in HLA-DQ2cis than one half of HLA-DQ2trans patients (105.5 vs. 19.2 U/mL, p = 0.014).Small clinical differences were found between paediatric coeliac patients carrying HLA-DR7-DQ2 and HLA-DR3-DQ2. For a correct screening of HLA-DQ2, at least in our geographical population, the HLA-DR7-DQ2 haplotype should be typed due to its frequency and clinical presentation.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628273","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.475955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.288889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.227825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.192918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Irritability","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritability"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Southern Europe","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"249","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/249"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"HLA-DQ","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DQ"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"HLA-DQ2","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DQ2"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"}]}
