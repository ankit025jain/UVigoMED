{"id":54614,"title":"Additive effect of repeated corneal collagen cross-linking in keratoconus.","abstract":"To report the long-term clinical outcome in a patient diagnosed as having bilateral progressive keratoconus who received a single corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) treatment in the right eye and repeated CXL in the left eye.Observational case report. Topographical changes were assessed by high-resolution Scheimpflug imaging. The right eye underwent a standard epithelium-off CXL procedure in February 2008, followed by the left eye 4 weeks later. In 2012, the left eye was treated with CXL for a second time. Irradiation was performed in all cases at a fluence of 5.4 J/cm². Energy settings were 30 minutes @ 3 mW/cm² for the CXL procedures performed in 2008, and 10 minutes @ 9 mW/cm² for the second CXL procedure of the left eye that was performed in 2012.The right eye that underwent a single CXL procedure showed a flattening of keratometry values between 2008 and 2012, followed by stabilization. The left eye showed a similar flattening effect between 2008 and 2012, followed by another flattening effect after the second CXL procedure and accompanied by a distinct increase in corrected distance visual acuity.Following repeated CXL, the corneal stroma and endothelium remained inconspicuous, and postoperative haze and visibility of the stromal demarcation line was similar to what is usually observed after a single CXL procedure. Whether the additive flattening effect of the anterior surface observed in this single case goes along with an additive increase in biomechanical stiffness remains to be seen.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291756","annotations":[{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.807725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.748875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Keratometer","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratometer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.547416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.425472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.355843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Fluence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluence"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Scheimpflug principle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheimpflug_principle"},{"name":"Flattening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening"},{"name":"Demarcation line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_line"},{"name":"Behavioral addiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_addiction"},{"name":"Haze","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze"},{"name":"Visibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visibility"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"}]}
