{"id":17888,"title":"Methylprednisolone enhances the growth of Exserohilum rostratum in vitro, attenuates spontaneous apoptosis, and increases mortality rates in immunocompetent Drosophila flies.","abstract":"High concentrations of methylprednisolone (0.32 mg/mL) accelerated growth and attenuated spontaneous apoptosis of Exserohilum rostratum in vitro. Injection of E. rostratum conidia preexposed to 0.32 mg/mL of methylprednisolone for 7 days in immunocompetent flies led to increased mortality and a higher fungal burden. Exposure to methylprednisolone could enhance the virulence of E. rostratum.
