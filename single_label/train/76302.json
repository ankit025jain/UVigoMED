{"id":76302,"title":"[Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with psoriasis].","abstract":"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a significant predictor of cardiovascular events.To assess the prevalence of MS in a Mexican population with psoriasis.A descriptive, case control study was performed, involving a series of 209 patients. Relevant demographic, clinical, anthropometric, and analytic information was obtained from all participants. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to the NCEP-ATPIII criteria.The study included 103 patients with psoriasis and 106 controls. The mean age of the case patients was 48.37 years; 55% were women and 46% were men. Metabolic syndrome was significantly more common in psoriatic patients than in controls (41.7 vs. 20%, odds ratio: 1.738; 95% CI: 1.194-2.531; p < 0.001). We also found a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus (17.3 vs. 6.6%; p = 0.001), alcoholic habits (8.7 vs. 0.9%; p = 0.009), and higher levels of blood pressure (p = 0.002), BMI (p = 0.016), waist circumference (p = 0.008), and triglycerides (p = 0.002).Psoriatic patients have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, which can favor cardiovascular events.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098216","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.863687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.247521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.225212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
