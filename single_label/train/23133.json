{"id":23133,"title":"The microbiological and sustainability effects of washing anaesthesia breathing circuits less frequently.","abstract":"In the presence of single-use airway filters, we quantified anaesthetic circuit aerobic microbial contamination rates when changed every 24 h, 48 h and 7 days. Microbiological samples were taken from the interior of 305 anaesthetic breathing circuits over a 15-month period (3197 operations). There was no significant difference in the proportion of contaminated circuits when changed every 24 h (57/105 (54%, 95% CI 45-64%)) compared with 48 h (43/100 (43%, 95% CI 33-53%, p = 0.12)) and up to 7 days (46/100 (46%, 95% CI 36-56%, p = 0.26)). Median bacterial counts were not increased at 48 h or 7 days provided circuits were routinely emptied of condensate. Annual savings for one hospital (six operating theatres) were $AU 5219 (£3079, €3654, $US 4846) and a 57% decrease in anaesthesia circuit steriliser loads associated with a yearly saving of 2760 kWh of electricity and 48 000 l of water. Our findings suggest that extended circuit use from 24 h up to 7 days does not significantly increase bacterial contamination, and is associated with labour, energy, water and financial savings.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502257","annotations":[{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.717131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.62659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Kilowatt hour","weight":0.429552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.418918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.265593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.252051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Electrical network","weight":0.140874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Washing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Astronomical unit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"305","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/305"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Condensation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
