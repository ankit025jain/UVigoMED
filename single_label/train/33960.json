{"id":33960,"title":"Amniotic band syndrome (ABS): can something be done during pregnancy in African poor countries? Three cases and review of the literature.","abstract":"Amniotic band syndrome (ABS) is a fetal congenital malformation, affecting mainly the limbs, but also the craniofacial area and internal organs. Two mains pathogenic mechanisms are proposed in its genesis. Firstly the early amnion rupture (exogenous theory) leading to fibrous bands, which wrap up the fetal body; secondly, the endogenous theory privileges vascular origin, mesoblastic strings not being a causal agent. The authors believe that the second theory explain the occurrence of ABS. The outcome of the disease during pregnancy depends on the gravity of the malformations. Interruption of the pregnancy is usually proposed when diagnosis of severe craniofacial and visceral abnormalities is confirmed. Whereas minor limb defects can be repaired with postnatal surgery. In case of an isolated amniotic band with a constricted limb, in utero lysis of the band can be considered to avoid a natural amputation. In an African country, such treatment is not possible as far as the antenatal diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779260","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.773392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"In utero","weight":0.734757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_utero"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Amnion","weight":0.644715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnion"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.576873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.571845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.422042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Amniotic band syndrome","weight":0.182172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_band_syndrome"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Gravitation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"}]}
