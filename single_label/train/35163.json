{"id":35163,"title":"Improved plasma cholesterol efflux capacity from human macrophages in patients with hyperalphalipoproteinemia.","abstract":"CETP or HL deficiencies lead to a marked increase in HDL-C levels however the atheroprotective effect of this phenotype, in particular the ability of HDL particles to remove cholesterol from human macrophages, remains to be determined.We measured cholesterol efflux from human THP-1 macrophages to total plasma or to isolated HDL subfractions in patients with HALP carrying molecular defect in either the CETP or LIPC gene.We demonstrate that HALP is associated with an increased plasma cholesterol efflux capacity from human macrophages. This observation is primarily related to a stimulation of both SR-BI and ABCA1 dependent efflux pathways as a result of quantitative elevation in HDL2 and enhanced intrinsic capacity of HDL3 subspecies, respectively.HDL particles from HALP patients with molecular defect within either CETP or LIPC gene are not dysfunctional and are efficient to stimulate cholesterol efflux from human macrophages.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674903","annotations":[{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.906652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.851375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.682679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.530912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.525722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Subspecies","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.31207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.180624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.163318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.116894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"High-Level Data Link Control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control"},{"name":"ABCA1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCA1"},{"name":"Hepatic lipase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_lipase"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Tetrahydropyran","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydropyran"},{"name":"American Baseball Coaches Association","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Baseball_Coaches_Association"},{"name":"Cholesterylester transfer protein","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterylester_transfer_protein"},{"name":"Subatomic particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"}]}
