{"id":83925,"title":"Retroperitoneal oblique corridor to the L2-S1 intervertebral discs in the lateral position: an anatomic study.","abstract":"Access to the intervertebral discs from L2-S1 in one surgical position can be challenging. The transpsoas minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach is preferred by many surgeons, but this approach poses potential risk to neural structures of the lumbar plexus as they course through the psoas. The lumbar plexus and iliac crest often restrict the L4-5 disc access, and the L5-S1 level has not been a viable option from a direct lateral approach. The purpose of the present study was to investigate an MIS oblique corridor to the L2-S1 intervertebral disc space in cadaveric specimens while keeping the specimens in a lateral decubitus position with minimal disruption of the psoas and lumbar plexus.Twenty fresh-frozen full-torso cadaveric specimens were dissected, and an oblique anatomical corridor to access the L2-S1 discs was examined. Measurements were taken in a static state and with mild retraction of the psoas. The access corridor was defined at L2-5 as the left lateral border of the aorta (or iliac artery) and the anterior medial border of the psoas. The L5-S1 corridor of access was defined transversely from the midsagittal line of the inferior endplate of L-5 to the medial border of the left common iliac vessel and vertically to the first vascular structure that crosses midline.The mean access corridor diameters in the static state and with mild psoas retraction, respectively, were as follows: at L2-3, 18.60 mm and 25.50 mm; at L3-4, 19.25 mm and 27.05 mm; and at L4-5, 15.00 mm and 24.45 mm. The L5-S1 corridor mean values were 14.75 mm transversely, from midline to the left common iliac vessel and 23.85 mm from the inferior endplate of L-5 cephalad to the first midline vessel.The oblique corridor allows access to the L2-S1 discs while keeping the patient in a lateral decubitus position without a break in the table. Minimal psoas retraction without significant tendon disruption allowed for a generous corridor to the disc space. The L5-S1 disc space can be accessed from an oblique angle consistently with gentle retraction of the iliac vessels. This study supports the potential of an MIS oblique retroperitoneal approach to the L2-S1 discs.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
