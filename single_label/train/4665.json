{"id":4665,"title":"Severity and outcome assessments of patients undertaking surgical orthodontic treatment.","abstract":"Combined orthognathic-orthodontic treatment can be lengthy and expensive. It is therefore important to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed treatment and the likely outcomes.To determine the demographic and surgical details of patients who received orthognathic-orthodontic treatment at Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, and to assess treatment using the Severity and Outcome Index (SOI).An observational and retrospective study was conducted of patients who received surgical orthodontic treatment between 2005 and 2012 at Christchurch Hospital. Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalometric radiographs of 93 patients were evaluated. Seven cephalometric parameters were assessed using the Severity and Outcome Index. A severity score ranged from 0 for the most severe to 7 for the least severe, while the outcome score ranged from 0 for the worst to 7 for the best outcome.Class II patients had a severity score of 3.4 and the best outcome score of 6.2. Class III patients had a severity score of 3.3 and an outcome score of 6.1. Patients with an anterior open bite (AOB) had the worst severity score of 3.0, and the worst outcome score of 5.9. The overall treatment outcome scores for all groups were statistically significantly greater than the severity scores, which increased from 3.4 to 6.1 (p < 0.05).Favourable outcomes were achieved for a group of patients with a high need for treatment. Christchurch Hospital appeared to be treating cases of increased severity and gained better treatment outcomes when compared with a United Kingdom (UK) national audit.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549521","annotations":[{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.785364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.690393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Open bite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_bite"},{"name":"Christchurch Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_Hospital"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Christchurch","weight":0.0239124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Rattlesnake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattlesnake"},{"name":"Seven Network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Network"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Silicon on insulator","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_on_insulator"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Agenda (meeting)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_(meeting)"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"},{"name":"Class III railroad","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_III_railroad"}]}
