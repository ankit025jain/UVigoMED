{"id":92442,"title":"Transplantation of SHED prevents bone loss in the early phase of ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis.","abstract":"Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are a unique postnatal stem cell population, possessing multipotent differentiation capacity and immunomodulatory properties. However, the mechanism by which SHED treat immune diseases is not fully understood. Here we show that systemic transplantation of SHED via the tail vein ameliorates ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteopenia by reducing T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 17 (Th17) cell numbers in the recipient OVX mice. Mechanistically, SHED transplantation induces activated T-cell apoptosis in OVX mice via Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated Fas pathway activation, leading to up-regulation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and down-regulation of Th1 and Th17 cells. This SHED-mediated immunomodulation rescues OVX-induced impairment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and activation of osteoclastogenesis, resulting in increased bone mass. In summary, SHED-mediated T-cell apoptosis via a FasL/Fas pathway results in immune tolerance and ameliorates the osteopenia phenotype in OVX mice.
