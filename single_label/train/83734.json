{"id":83734,"title":"Impact of surgeon volume on incidence of neck hematoma after thyroid and parathyroid surgery: ten years' analysis of nationwide in-patient sample database.","abstract":"The study's objective is to examine the impact of surgeon experience on the incidence and the severity of neck hematoma after thyroid and parathyroid surgery using a nationwide database. The Nationwide In-patient Sample is a nationwide clinical and administrative database. We used the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnosis and procedures codes to identify adult patients who underwent thyroid and parathyroid surgery and subsequently developed neck hematoma. Patient and hospital characteristics were collected along with surgeon volume to predict patient outcomes. Surgical procedures were stratified into three groups according to surgeon volume: low (less than 10 operations), intermediate (10 to 99), and high (100 or more). We identified 147,344 thyroid and parathyroid surgery performed between 2000 and 2009 nationwide. Overall incidence of postoperative neck hematoma was 1.5 per cent (n = 2210). This was 2.1, 1.4, and 0.9 per cent among procedures performed by low-volume, intermediate-volume, and high-volume surgeons, respectively. After adjusting for other confounders, compared with procedures performed by low-volume surgeons, those performed by intermediate- (odds ratio [OR], 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 0.8; P < 0.01) and high-volume surgeons (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.6; P < 0.01) were less to likely to develop neck hematoma. Surgeon experience is significantly associated with the development of neck hematoma after thyroid and parathyroid surgery.
