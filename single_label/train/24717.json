{"id":24717,"title":"[Particulate matter air pollution effects on the incidence of heart diseases among the urban population].","abstract":"Increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases induces an urgent need to identify and clear delineation of the most important risk factors for the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Unlike the second part of XXth century, today the World Health Organization considers particulate matter ambient pollution one of the most important predictors of cardiovascular events. However, results of similar studies conducted in the last decades, is highly fragmented. The authors' objective was to try to understand and organize this massive of accumulated information and analyze it to draw conclusions about the impact of particulate matter on the functioning of human cardiovascular system.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306597","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.757355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.705099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cardiovascular system","weight":0.617249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_system"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.599862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Professional wrestling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
