{"id":51288,"title":"Effect of HbA1C detection on the diagnostic screening for glucose metabolic disorders in polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"This study aimed to assess the effect of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) detection on the diagnostic screening for glucose metabolic disorders in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A total of 161 patients with PCOS (mean age = 23.68 +/- 4.23 years) were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and HbA1C was used to probe the sensitivity and specificity of abnormal glucose tolerance.Based on the traditional standards of blood sugar, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 5.6%, and the pre-diabetes prevalence was 7.5%. Based on the HbA1C standards, 4.3% of patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and 10.6% of the diabetic patients can be considered as high-risk populations. Based on the combined standards of OGTT and HbA1C, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 6.2%, and the pre-diabetes prevalence was 12.4%. OGTT is considered the gold standard for identifying abnormal glucose tolerance, and HbA1C detection is considered to be stronger than FPG. The areas under the ROC curves of HbA1C and FPG were 0.968 and 0.672, respectively (p < 0.01). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the cut-off value of HbA1c > or = 5.7% and FPG > or = 5.6 mmol/l for identifying abnormal glucose tolerance. The sensitivity and specificity were 76.7% and 89.5% for HBA1C, as well as 40.5% and 94.3% for FPG, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 7.3 and 0.26 for HbA1C, as well as 7.1 and 0.63 for FPG, respectively.HbA1C detection can be used as a method for diagnosis and screening.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707685","annotations":[{"name":"American Diabetes Association","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Diabetes_Association"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.637545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.596715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.415246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.119691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Hemoglobin, alpha 1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin,_alpha_1"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
