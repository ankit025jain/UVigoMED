{"id":62563,"title":"Anti-CD37 antibodies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","abstract":"Immunotherapy using mAbs is a safe and effective method for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other lymphoid malignancies. In recent years, mAbs based on selective B-cell depletion - rituximab, ofatumumab and obinutuzumab - have been approved for use in CLL therapy. More recently, CD37, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily of cell surface antigens, has been considered as a target for B-cell malignancies.The results of preclinical and early clinical studies suggest that in patients with CLL, newer anti-CD37 agents, otlertuzumab (formerly known as TRU-016), BI 836826, IMGN529 and (177)Lu-tetulomab can be useful in the treatment of this disease.CD37 may offer advantages over CD20 as a target for CLL cells. It is selectively expressed on normal mature B cells and by most B-cell malignancies. Anti-CD37 antibodies may be useful for patients resistant or refractory to anti-CD20 mAb therapy or relapsing after such treatment. The development of these agents into a clinically useful therapy for CLL is probably many years away and will be followed with great interest by laboratory investigators and clinicians.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555705","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.751055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.455312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.445037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Ofatumumab","weight":0.354902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofatumumab"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.113019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
