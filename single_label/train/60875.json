{"id":60875,"title":"Home care during neutropenia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children and adolescents is safe and may be more advantageous than isolation in hospital.","abstract":"After ASCT, children are isolated in hospital to prevent neutropenic infections. Patients living within two-h drive from the hospital were given the option of treatment at home after ASCT. Daily visits by an experienced nurse and phone calls from a physician from the unit were included in the protocol. We compared 29 children and adolescents treated at home with 58 matched hospital controls. The children spent a median time of 13 days at home (range 2-24 days) and 6 (0-35) days in hospital. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV was 21% in the home-care children and 39% in the controls (p = 0.1). Chronic GVHD and probability of relapse were similar in the two groups. TRM at five yr was 11% in the home-care patients and 18% in the controls. Overall survival at three yr was 77% and 62%, respectively (p = 0.33). None of the patients died at home. Median costs were 38,748 euros in the home-care patients and 49,282 euros in those treated in the hospital (p = 0.2). We conclude that it is safe for children and adolescents to be treated at home during the pancytopenic phase after ASCT.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802347","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.884812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.732141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.497093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.40129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.364836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Euro","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/224"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"TeleRadio-Moldova","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeleRadio-Moldova"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Home range","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_range"},{"name":"Home care","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care"}]}
