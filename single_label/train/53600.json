{"id":53600,"title":"Atorvastatin for ovarian torsion: effects on follicle counts, AMH, and VEGF expression.","abstract":"To determine if atorvastatin protects ovarian follicles against ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury and to determine how anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression is altered.This experimental study was conducted at the Baskent University Animal Research Laboratory. Forty-four rats were arbitrarily assigned into four groups of 11 rats each. The control group underwent a laparotomy. The atorvastatin group received atorvastatin (10mg/kg/day), by oral gavage 7 days before and 7 days after the sham operation. The torsion group had bilateral torsion and detorsion of the ovaries. The atorvastatin+torsion group received atorvastatin (10mg/kg/day) 7 days before and 7 days after the torsion/detorsion operation. At day 7, the animals were euthanized and their ovaries were removed. Ovarian follicles were counted, and AMH and VEGF-A expression was determined. The Kruskal-Wallis, ?(2), or Fisher's exact test were used when appropriate.Primordial follicles (p=0.001), VEGF-A expression (p=0.018) and vascularization (p=0.02) were significantly higher in the atorvastatin group compared to controls. Primordial (p=0.002), primary (p=0.001), and secondary follicles (p=0.001), AMH expression (p=0.001), and vascularization (p=0.001) were lower in the torsion group compared with the control group. Primordial follicles (p=0.001), AMH (p=0.001) and VEGFA expression (p=0.001), and vascularization (p=0.001) were significantly higher in the atorvastatin+torsion group compared to the torsion group.Atorvastatin increased the primordial follicle pool and vascularization and protected primordial follicles and vascular structures against I/R injury.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507756","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.889499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.82664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Folliculogenesis","weight":0.573269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folliculogenesis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.532099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.473606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.430064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.323648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.300327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.201603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Ovarian torsion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_torsion"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Testicular torsion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_torsion"},{"name":"Bilateral symmetry","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"}]}
