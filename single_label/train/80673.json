{"id":80673,"title":"The need for global collaboration to tackle hidden public health crisis of Chagas disease.","abstract":"Chagas disease has a unique history where the confluence of rural and marginalized populations affected, the deeply rooted attitudes, clinical practices and an underfunded research area has resulted in one of the most current neglected health issues. Globalization has changed the epidemiology of the disease, which is now found throughout the Americas but also in Europe and Japan. Thus, Chagas disease is a global public health problem. In this new paradigm, a strong partnership aimed to coordinate actions to scale up diagnostics and treatments, to engage communities and health practitioners in implementation and advocating for sustained funding for the development of improved tools, can play a critical role to leave behind this story of neglect. Even with the imperfect tools currently available, still much can be done.
