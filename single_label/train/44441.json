{"id":44441,"title":"Impact of rotavirus vaccination on diarrhea-related hospitalizations in São Paulo State, Brazil.","abstract":"Following introduction of routine infant rotavirus vaccination, severe diarrhea hospitalization rates declined among children aged <5 years throughout Brazil. Ensuring equity of rotavirus vaccine impact is important in countries that self-finance immunization programs. The objective of this study was to examine rotavirus vaccine impact on diarrhea admission rates among children aged <5 years in Brazil's public health system, according to area-based measures of human development in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.Ecological analysis of public health system hospitalization rates for acute gastroenteritis among children aged <5 years in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, according to five categories of municipal development based on a modified Human Development Index for municipalities. Acute gastroenteritis hospitalization rates among children aged <5 years after national rotavirus vaccine introduction (2008-2011) were compared to rates in pre-vaccine years (2000-2005) to calculate percent decline in rates (1-rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each municipal development category. Direct hospitalization costs during the two periods were compared.Annual rates declined by 40% (95% CI, 39-42%) from 631 diarrhea hospitalizations per 100,000 person years pre-rotavirus vaccination to 377 per 100,000 post-vaccination among children aged <5 years and 50% (95% CI, 48-52%) from 1009 to 505 per 100,000 among infants. Highest rates were observed in least developed municipalities. Significant declines of 26-52% among children <5 years and 41-63% among infants were observed in all categories of municipal development. Lower diarrhea hospitalization rates resulted in annual savings of approximately 2 million USD for the state of São Paulo. Savings in direct hospitalization costs benefitted municipalities in all five categories.The introduction of rotavirus vaccination was associated with substantial reductions of diarrhea-related admissions at all levels of municipal development in São Paulo State, Brazil.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736002","annotations":[{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Human Development Index","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.777919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.604453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.385386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.301695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.235771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Rotavirus vaccine","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus_vaccine"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Least developed country","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_country"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Justice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"}]}
