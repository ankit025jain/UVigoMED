{"id":24083,"title":"Relation between gastric cancer and protein oxidation, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to evaluate protein oxidation, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation in patients with gastric cancer and to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and gastric cancer.We investigated changes in serum protein carbonyl (PC), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels, as indicators of protein oxidation, serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), as a biomarker of DNA damage, and malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated diene (CD), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and 8-ISO-prostaglandin F2? (8-PGF) in serum, as lipid peroxidation markers in gastric cancer (GC) patients and healthy control.Compared with control, a statistically significant higher values of 8-OHdG, PC, AOPP, and 3-NT were observed in the GC patients (P < 0.05). The products of lipid peroxidation, MDA, CD, 4-HNE, and 8-PGF, were significantly lower in the GC patients compared to those of control (P < 0.05). In addition, the products of oxidative stress were similar between the Helicobacter pylori positive and the negative subgroups of GC patients.GC patients were characterized by increased protein oxidation and DNA damage, and decreased lipid peroxidation. Assessment of oxidative stress and augmentation of the antioxidant defense system may be important for the treatment and prevention of gastric carcinogenesis.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24454985","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.881767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Carbonyl","weight":0.838117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.657429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.592099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.530091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.514821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.0655037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Diene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diene"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
