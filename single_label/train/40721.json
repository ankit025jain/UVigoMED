{"id":40721,"title":"Acute esophageal necrosis: a case series and long-term follow-up.","abstract":"Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is a rare condition characterized by circumferential necrosis of varying lengths in the intrathoracic esophagus. Endoscopically, this process is manifested as a black esophagus. To date, limited case series exist describing AEN, and none report long-term follow-up. Our objective was to report 3 patients with AEN, all diagnosed within 1 year at a tertiary academic medical center, describing early and long-term outcomes of this rare disease. In the absence of perforation, patients can be managed conservatively with serial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Long-term strictures may occur that require dilation.
