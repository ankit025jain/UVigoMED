{"id":61705,"title":"Can full-dose contrast-enhanced CT be omitted from an FDG-PET/CT staging examination in newly diagnosed FDG-avid lymphoma?","abstract":"To determine whether full-dose contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) (CECT) can be omitted from an F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) (FDG-PET)/CT staging examination in newly diagnosed FDG-avid lymphoma.Twenty-nine patients with newly diagnosed FDG-avid lymphoma prospectively underwent unenhanced low-dose FDG-PET/CT and CECT. Different observers evaluated unenhanced low-dose FDG-PET/CT and CECT in a blinded manner. Ann Arbor stages according to unenhanced low-dose FDG-PET/CT and CECT were compared, and discrepancies between the 2 imaging modalities were resolved using bone marrow biopsy and posttreatment FDG-PET/CT as reference standard. Finally, it was assessed as to how many cases therapy would have been changed based on additional CECT findings.In 27 of 29 patients (93%; 95% confidence interval, 78%-98%), CECT either did not change or did not correctly change the Ann Arbor stage that was assigned according to unenhanced low-dose FDG-PET findings. In 2 of 29 patients (7%; 95% confidence interval, 2%-22%), CECT correctly provided another Ann Arbor stage than unenhanced low-dose FDG-PET/CT. In the latter 2 cases, therapy would not have been changed based on additional CECT findings.Unenhanced low-dose FDG-PET/CT alone is suggested as the primary imaging modality of choice for staging patients with newly diagnosed FDG-avid lymphoma. This diagnostic approach is particularly indicated in younger patients in whom diagnostic radiation exposure should be minimized and in patients who are at increased risk of CT contrast-induced allergic reactions or nephropathy.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681861","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone marrow examination","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_examination"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.668418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.633755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.363246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Ann Arbor staging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor_staging"},{"name":"Ann Arbor, Michigan","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
