{"id":9356,"title":"Impact of a Met(11)Thr single nucleotide polymorphism of surfactant protein D on allergic airway inflammation in a murine asthma model.","abstract":"The surfactant-associated proteins SP-A and D are pattern recognition molecules with collectin structure. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) exchanging a methionine (Met) for a threonine (Thr) in the amino-terminal SP-D domain influences the oligomeric structure and function of the protein. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of mice transgenic for the human SP-D Met(11)Thr SNP to allergic airway inflammation and consequences for microRNA (miRNA, miR) expression. Mice expressing either human Met or Thr SP-D were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) in an acute model of allergic asthma. The influence of the SP-D polymorphism on the allergic airway inflammation was evaluated by lung function measurement, pulmonary inflammation parameters, morphological analysis and miRNA expression. Airway hyperresponsiveness, allergic inflammation, and mucus metaplasia were not significantly different between mice expressing one or the other allelic variant of SP-D. OVA sensitization and challenge led to significant airway hyperresponsiveness in wildtype mice and significantly lower eosinophil numbers and interleukin 5 levels in Thr SP-D mice. OVA challenge induced an upregulation of miR-21 and 155 in Thr SP-D mice and a downregulation of miR-21 in Met SP-D mice. Our results show that murine expression of human polymorphic SP-D variants does not significantly influence the severity of allergic airway inflammation. MiR-21 and 155 are differentially regulated in transgenic mice in response to allergic inflammation. Further studies are required to elucidate the impact of this SNP on inflammatory conditions of the lung.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712849","annotations":[{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Surfactant","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.796792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.786484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Threonine","weight":0.785321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.753378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.660967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Interleukin 5","weight":0.642059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_5"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.567702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Oligomer","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.437617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.417445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Metaplasia","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.360137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.285167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.280296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.208774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Allergic inflammation","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_inflammation"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Ovalbumin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovalbumin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"}]}
