{"id":22827,"title":"The clinical management of cesarean section-acquired Mycobacterium abscessus surgical site infections.","abstract":"Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) can cause a broad spectrum of both community and healthcare-associated infections in humans. The aim of this study was to report the clinical management and outcomes of successive patients following cesarean delivery with healthcare-associated surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by RGM.Patients who were admitted to Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, between September 2006 and July 2008, and who developed SSIs following cesarean delivery at an obstetrics hospital and were then referred to our hospital, were enrolled. Demographic characteristics of the patients and clinical isolates were obtained retrospectively and an environmental investigation was performed. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the hsp65gene and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of large genomic DNA restriction fragments were applied to differentiate Mycobacterium species.Seventeen patients were diagnosed with RGM infections by microbiology and/or histopathology. Mycobacterial isolates by PCR-RFLP analysis from 15 patients revealed Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) and M. lentiflavum. Most of the patients received surgical debridement and combination antimicrobial therapy and were eventually cured.Our study demonstrates the potential that RGM infections have in causing healthcare-associated SSIs. Surgery plus prolonged combination antimicrobial therapy seemed to be an effective option for the management of M. abscessus infections.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518628","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.780738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.767901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.759409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.708843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.650644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.533323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.44856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.344437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Restriction digest","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_digest"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"}]}
