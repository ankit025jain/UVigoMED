{"id":47399,"title":"The PAS positive material in gastric cancer cells of signet ring type is not mucin.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to assess the exocrine and neuroendocrine properties of tumour cells in diffuse gastric cancer with signet ring cell differentiation.Mucin mRNA and protein expressions (MUC1, 2, 3, 4, 5AC, 6 and MUC13) were assessed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The neuroendocrine properties were evaluated by protein and mRNA expression of the general neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin.No MUC expression was observed in signet ring tumour cells including the amorphous substance in any of the nine cases. All cases showed immunoreactivity to synaptophysin, and seven out of nine cases immunoreactivity to chromogranin A in signet ring and non-signet ring tumour cells. Chromogranin A mRNA expression was observed in tumour cells in all samples with retained mRNA.The lack of MUC protein and mRNA in signet ring tumour cells suggests the amorphous substance is not mucin. The lack of MUC mRNA expression in non-signet ring tumour cells questions exocrine differentiation in this tumour group. The abundant protein expression of the general neuroendocrine markers CgA and synaptophysin, and mRNA expression in tumour cells strengthens the hypothesis that this tumour group may be of neuroendocrine origin.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589859","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Exocrine gland","weight":0.707573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.692933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Synaptophysin","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptophysin"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.537301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.401066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Granin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granin"},{"name":"MUC1","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUC1"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Amorphous solid","weight":0.249069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_solid"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.247594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Signet ring cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring_cell"},{"name":"Periodic acid-Schiff stain","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_acid-Schiff_stain"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
