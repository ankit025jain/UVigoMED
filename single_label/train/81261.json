{"id":81261,"title":"Periodontal health--challenges in restorative dentistry.","abstract":"As the population ages and life expectancy increases, clinicians today find themselves in the wake of an ever-growing demand for high-quality aesthetic dental treatment, by increasingly informed patients. The long-term success of both cosmetic and restorative dentistry is dependent on well designed restorations and the health of the periodontal tissues. Overhanging restorations, full crown restorations with poor marginal fit, and implant-supported prosthetics with inadequate hygiene access all increase the risk for periodontal sequelae and interproximal caries. When planning restorative treatment, consideration should be given to the restorative design, the need for hygiene access and the location of intended implants. In addition, the patient's manual dexterity and ability to manipulate oral hygiene aids is a crucial consideration, as is adequate access for the hygienist to manually debride and maintain the restorations.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25215346","annotations":[{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.805861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.703373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.612086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.568871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.562025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.546869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.476225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.425798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.118635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Restorative dentistry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_dentistry"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Fine motor skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill"}]}
