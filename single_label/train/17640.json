{"id":17640,"title":"Paediatric ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection caused by Actinomyces neuii.","abstract":"We present the first reported case of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection secondary to Actinomyces neuii in a paediatric patient. Our patient was managed with temporary shunt removal, intrathecal antibiotics and a prolonged course of intravenous and then oral antibiotics. She went on to make a complete recovery. Subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis at 5?months post-treatment demonstrated no evidence of residual infection.
