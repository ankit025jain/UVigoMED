{"id":44076,"title":"IFN-? receptor 1 expression is induced in chronic hepatitis C and correlates with the IFN-?3 genotype and with nonresponsiveness to IFN-? therapies.","abstract":"The molecular mechanisms that link IFN-?3 genotypes to differential induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) are not known. We measured the expression of IFN-? and of the specific IFN-? receptor chain (IFN-?R1) in 122 liver biopsies of patients with CHC and 53 control samples. The IFN-?3 genotype was not associated with differential expression of IFN-?, but rather IFN-?R1. In a series of 30 primary human hepatocyte (PHH) samples, IFN-?R1 expression was low but could be induced with IFN-?. IFN-?-induced IFN-?R1 expression was significantly stronger in PHHs carrying the minor IFN-?3 allele. The analysis of liver biopsies of patients with CHC revealed a strong association of high IFN-?R1 expression with elevated ISG expression, with IFN-?3 minor alleles, and with nonresponse to pegylated IFN-? and ribavirin. The findings provide a missing link between the IFN-?3 genotype and the associated phenotype of treatment nonresponse.
