{"id":4611,"title":"[The membrane potential of mitochondria of thrombocytes in patients with chronic obstructive disease of lungs].","abstract":"The article presents results of study of membrane potential of mitochondria of thrombocytes in patients with chronic obstructive disease of lungs. The index of membrane potential of mitochondria reflects both disorders of oxygen consumption by blood cells and development of hypoxia. At the same time, index denotes formation and progression of bronchopulmonary pathology. The direct relationship is established between the degree of bronchial patency and condition of mitochondrial apparatus of cell. The lower bronchial patency is the lesser index of membrane potential of mitochondria is. This dependence testifies lesion of mitochondrion and development of mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, the established pattern can be taken into account in the process of development of medical technologies of prognostic of disorders of bronchial patency under diseases of respiratory organs.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335394","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.391766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.251669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Medical technology","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_technology"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0687277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0127255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"}]}
