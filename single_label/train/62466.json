{"id":62466,"title":"Lung cancer with sarcoid reaction in the lymph nodes following chemoradiotherapy.","abstract":"This report describes a case of lung cancer with sarcoid reaction following chemoradiotherapy, showing false-positive accumulation of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose on positron-emission tomography in a 55-year-old man. Treatment-related sarcoid reaction should be considered when the accumulation of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose shows rapid extension in the course of treatment.
