{"id":55117,"title":"Decreased proteasomal activity causes photoreceptor degeneration in mice.","abstract":"To study the retinal degeneration caused by decreased proteasomal activity in ?5t transgenic (?5t-Tg) mice, an animal model of senescence acceleration.?5t-Tg mice and age-matched littermate control (WT) mice were used. Proteasomal activities and protein level of poly-ubiquitinated protein in retinal extracts were quantified. Fundus images of ?5t-Tg mice were taken and their features were assessed. For histologic evaluation, the thicknesses of inner nuclear layer (INL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), and photoreceptor outer segment (OS) were measured. For functional analysis, ERG was recorded under scotopic and photopic illumination conditions. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining and TUNEL were performed to investigate the mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration.Chymotrypsin-like activity was partially suppressed in retinal tissues of ?5t-Tg mice. Retinal degenerative changes with arterial attenuation were present in ?5t-Tg, but not in WT mice. Inner nuclear layer thickness showed no significant change between ?5t-Tg and WT mice at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months of age. By contrast, thicknesses of ONL and OS in ?5t-Tg mice were significantly decreased at 3, 6, and 9 months compared with those in WT mice. Electroretinograms showed decrease of scotopic a-wave amplitude in ?5t-Tg mice. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in ONL were significantly increased in ?5t-Tg mice and colocalized with apoptosis-inducing factor, but not with cleaved caspase-3 and -9, indicating that the photoreceptor cell death was induced via a caspase-independent pathway.The current data showed that impaired proteasomal function causes photoreceptor degeneration.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24994871","annotations":[{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.779985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.69692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.656909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.275564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Electroretinography","weight":0.131299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"TUNEL assay","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUNEL_assay"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Photopic vision","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision"},{"name":"Scotopic vision","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotopic_vision"},{"name":"Inner nuclear layer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Outer nuclear layer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Lighting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
