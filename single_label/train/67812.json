{"id":67812,"title":"Medical nutrition therapy in adults with chronic kidney disease: integrating evidence and consensus into practice for the generalist registered dietitian nutritionist.","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease is classified in stages 1 to 5 by the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative depending on the level of renal function by glomerular filtration rate and, more recently, using further categorization depending on the level of glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes initiative. Registered dietitian nutritionists can be reimbursed for medical nutrition therapy in chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 4 for specific clients under Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services coverage. This predialysis medical nutrition therapy counseling has been shown to both potentially delay progression to stage 5 (renal replacement therapy) and decrease first-year mortality after initiation of hemodialysis. The Joint Standards Task Force of the American Dietetic Association (now the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics), the Renal Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group, and the National Kidney Foundation Council on Renal Nutrition collaboratively published 2009 Standards of Practice and Standards of Professional Performance for generalist, specialty, and advanced practice registered dietitian nutritionists in nephrology care. The purpose of this article is to provide an update on current recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease for application in clinical practice for the generalist registered dietitian nutritionist using the evidence-based library of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, published clinical practice guidelines (ie, National Kidney Foundation Council on Renal Nutrition, Renal Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group, Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes), the Nutrition Care Process model, and peer-reviewed literature.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582998","annotations":[{"name":"Renal
