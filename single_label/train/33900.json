{"id":33900,"title":"Alleviation of plasma homocysteine level by phytoestrogen ?-zearalanol might be related to the reduction of cystathionine ?-synthase nitration.","abstract":"Hyperhomocysteinemia is strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have shown that phytoestrogen ?-zearalanol can protect cardiovascular system from hyperhomocysteinemia and ameliorate the level of plasma total homocysteine; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. The aim of this research is to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in ameliorating the level of plasma homocysteine by ?-zearalanol. By the successfully established diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia rat models, we found that, after ?-zearalanol treatment, the activity of cystathionine ?-synthase, the key enzyme in homocysteine metabolism, was significantly elevated and level of nitrative stress in liver was significantly reduced. In correlation with this, results also showed a decreased nitration level of cystathionine ?-synthase in liver. Together data implied that alleviation of plasma homocysteine level by phytoestrogen ?-zearalanol might be related to the reduction of cystathionine ?-synthase nitration.
