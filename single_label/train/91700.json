{"id":91700,"title":"Trauma-Focused Early Intensive Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (TF-EICBI) in children and adolescent survivors of suicide bombing attacks (SBAs). A preliminary study.","abstract":"To describe and evaluate the impact of an early intervention (Trauma-Focused Early Intensive Cognitive Behavioral Intervention, TF-EICBI) in children and adolescents who were victims of suicide bombing attacks (SBAs) in Israel.Description of an intervention and preliminary experience in its use.An acute trauma center of a Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit in a Department of Psychiatry of a university-affiliated medical center.Ten children and adolescents who were victims of SBAs and underwent early interventions (EIG) were compared to 11 adolescent victims who received no intervention (NEIG). The EIG included all the children and adolescent survivors of various SBAs that had occurred during 1 year who presented to our hospital after the TF-EICBI was implemented (June 2001). The NEIG comprised all adolescents girls <18 years of age at follow-up who survived one SBA (at the \"Dolphinarium\" Discotheque) before the TF-EICBI was available.At the time of the 1-year post-SBA follow-up, all 21 subjects were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis 1 DSMIII R Disorders (SCID), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).One (10 percent) EI subject and four (36.4 percent) NEI subjects had post-traumatic stress disorder. The mean CBCL total score and most of the mean CBCL behavior problem scores were significantly higher (p < 0.021) among the NEI group members.Intervention was effective in preventing and lowering mental morbidity of children and adolescents after SBAs.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481886","annotations":[{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.837028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Suicide attack","weight":0.725605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.720697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Human behavior","weight":0.501818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.404048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.366177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Axis powers","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Attachment measures","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_measures"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Severe combined immunodeficiency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_combined_immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Bomb","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Network Ten","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Ten"},{"name":"Early intervention in psychosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_intervention_in_psychosis"}]}
