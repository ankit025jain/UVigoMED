A single factor was obtained correlating highly with simple unweighted scoring.Sufficient consistency and initial validity information was obtained from patients with a history of active chronic otitis media to justify clinical use of the reduced item set and acquisition of further data to refine scoring.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518406","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.706065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"England","weight":0.355396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"History","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Otology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otology"},{"name":"First principle","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Weighting filter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting_filter"},{"name":"Dow Jones Industrial Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Refining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refining"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"}]}
