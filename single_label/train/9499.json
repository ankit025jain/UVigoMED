{"id":9499,"title":"Persistent impaired glucose metabolism in a zebrafish hyperglycemia model.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects over 10% of the world's population. Hyperglycemia is the main feature for the diagnosis of this disease. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an established model organism for the study of various metabolic diseases. In this paper, hyperglycemic zebrafish, when immersed in a 111 mM glucose solution for 14 days, developed increased glycation of proteins from the eyes, decreased mRNA levels of insulin receptors in the muscle, and a reversion of high blood glucose level after treatment with anti-diabetic drugs (glimepiride and metformin) even after 7 days of glucose withdrawal. Additionally, hyperglycemic zebrafish developed an impaired response to exogenous insulin, which was recovered after 7 days of glucose withdrawal. These data suggest that the exposure of adult zebrafish to high glucose concentration is able to induce persistent metabolic changes probably underlined by a hyperinsulinemic state and impaired peripheral glucose metabolism.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704522","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Glimepiride","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glimepiride"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.754704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.617753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.577461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.570895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Zebrafish","weight":0.481166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.348026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.2092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
