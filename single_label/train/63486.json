{"id":63486,"title":"Host genetic variants of ABCB1 and IL15 influence treatment outcome in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","abstract":"Host germline variations and their potential prognostic importance is an emerging area of interest in paediatric ALL.We investigated the associations between 20 germline variations and various clinical end points in 463 children with ALL.After adjusting for known prognostic factors, variants in two genes were found to be independently associated with poorer EFS: ABCB1 T/T at either 2677 (rs2032582) or 3435 (rs1045642) position (P=0.003) and IL15 67276493G/G (rs17015014; P=0.022). These variants showed a strong additive effect affecting outcome (P<0.001), whereby patients with both risk genotypes had the worst EFS (P=0.001), even after adjusting for MRD levels at the end of remission induction. The adverse effect of ABCB1 T/T genotypes was most pronounced in patients with favourable cytogenetics (P=0.011) while the IL15 67276493G/G genotype mainly affected patients without common chromosomal abnormalities (P=0.022). In both cytogenetic subgroups, increasing number of such risk genotypes still predicted worsening outcome (P<0.001 and=0.009, respectively).These results point to the prognostic importance of host genetic variants, although the specific mechanisms remain unclarified. Inclusion of ABCB1 and IL15 variants may help improve risk assignment strategies in paediatric ALL.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434428","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.824338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.777624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.767585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.756407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.560458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.510971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.34672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Encrypting File System","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypting_File_System"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Domain of discourse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Behavioral addiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_addiction"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Interleukin 15","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_15"}]}
