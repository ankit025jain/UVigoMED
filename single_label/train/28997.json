{"id":28997,"title":"Selective orexin 2 receptor antagonism blocks cue-induced reinstatement, but not nicotine self-administration or nicotine-induced reinstatement.","abstract":"The orexinergic system has been implicated in a number of behaviors, including reward and incentive motivation. Orexin 1 receptor antagonism has been reported to reduce drug self-administration, conditioned place preference, and reinstatement in rodents, but the role of the orexin 2 receptor is unclear. Here we evaluated the impact of the novel and selective orexin 2 receptor antagonist, 2-SORA 18, on motivation for nicotine as measured by responding on a progressive ratio schedule, as well as cue-induced reinstatement of a response previously associated with nicotine reward, and nicotine-induced reinstatement. 2-SORA 18 demonstrated selective effects on these behaviors. Specifically, doses up to 60 mg/kg 2-SORA 18 were without significant effect on nicotine self-administration or nicotine-induced reinstatement, but doses as low as 15 mg/kg 2-SORA 18 completely blocked cue-induced reinstatement. These findings indicate that orexin 2 receptor antagonism might have utility for attenuating relapse, particularly for patients sensitive to environmental stimuli associated with drug taking.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746488","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.64342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.636415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.328957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Reward system","weight":0.0739627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Orexin","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orexin"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.0385965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Conditioned place preference","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditioned_place_preference"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Southern Rails Cooperative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rails_Cooperative"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Incentive","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive"}]}
