{"id":77545,"title":"[Diagnosis and treatment of polyneuropathy].","abstract":"The electroneuromyographic examination of patients with the occupational polyneuropathy of the extremities after the exposure to the whole-body and local vibration has been performed with the aim to reveal the diagnostic indices of polyneuropathy severity under stationary conditions. The main diagnostic criteria of polyneuropathy severity have been revealed using the discriminant analysis. The drug gabapentine (tebantine) has been tested as the basic pharmacotherapy.
