{"id":5254,"title":"[The change of NOS in pulmonary oxygen toxicity induced by different oxygen pressure].","abstract":"Long time exhaled oxygen will induced oxygen toxicity. Some studies had found that different pathology may exised in normobaric and hyperbaric pulmonary oxygen toxicity, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) may play a role. In this study, we discussed the change of NOS in normobaric and hyperbaric pulmonary oxygen toxicity.Sixty male SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 10), exposed to 1 ATA (atmosphere absolute), 1.5 ATA, 2 ATA, 2.5 ATA and 3 ATA, 100% oxygen for 56, 20, 10, 8, 6 hours respectively. Rats were exposed to air as control. After exposure, the protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the wet/dry weight of lung and the expression of eNOS, nNOS in lung were defined.As compared to air group, the protein in BALF, the wet/dry of lung were significantly elevated in 1.0 ATA group, while these changes were not so obviously in the other groups, and these changes in hyperbaric oxygen group (approximately 1.0 ATA) were significantly decreased as compared with nonnrmobaric oxygen group (1.0 ATA). The expression of nNOS were not changed in normobaric and hyperbaric pulmonary oxygen toxicity, while the expression of eNOS was significantly decreased in 2 ATA group, and significantly elevated in 2.5 ATA and 3 ATA group.The expression of eNOS can change when exposed to different pressures of oxygen.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244787","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.717882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Oxygen toxicity","weight":0.634308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity"},{"name":"Nitrous oxide","weight":0.583545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.523819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hyperbaric medicine","weight":0.472954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.42313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Atmosphere (unit)","weight":0.32868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.190163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.171605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Atmosphere","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Thermodynamic temperature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature"},{"name":"Group (military aviation unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(military_aviation_unit)"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"}]}
