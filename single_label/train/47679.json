{"id":47679,"title":"The LEF1/CYLD axis and cIAPs regulate RIP1 deubiquitination and trigger apoptosis in selenite-treated colorectal cancer cells.","abstract":"Inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP) inhibitors have been reported to synergistically reduce cell viability in combination with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs via targeted cellular IAP (cIAP) depletion. Here, we found that cIAP silencing sensitised colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to selenite-induced apoptosis. Upon selenite treatment, the K63-linked ubiquitin chains on receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) were removed, leading to the formation of the death-inducing complex and subsequent caspase-8 activation. Although the ubiquitinases cIAP1 and cIAP2 were significantly downregulated after a 24-h selenite treatment, cylindromatosis (CYLD) deubiquitinase protein levels were marginally upregulated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF1) dissociated from the CYLD promoter upon selenite treatment, thus abolishing suppression of CYLD gene expression. We corroborated these findings in a CRC xenograft animal model using immunohistochemistry. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that selenite caused CYLD upregulation via LEF1 and cIAP downregulation, both of which contribute to the degradation of ubiquitin chains on RIP1 and subsequent caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. Importantly, our results identify a LEF1-binding site in the CYLD promoter as a potential target for combinational therapy as an alternative to cIAPs.
