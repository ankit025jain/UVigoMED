{"id":37428,"title":"Regulation of the phosphorylation and nuclear import and export of ?-catenin by APC and its cancer-related truncated form.","abstract":"We report the first direct analysis of the endogenous ?-catenin phosphorylation activity in colon cancer SW480 cells. By comparing parental SW480 cells that harbor a typical truncated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) form, cells expressing full-length APC and APC-depleted cells, we provide the formal demonstration that APC is necessary for ?-catenin phosphorylation, both for priming of the protein at residue serine 45 and for the subsequent phosphorylation of residues 33, 37 and 41. Truncated APC still sustains a surprisingly high phosphorylation activity, which requires the protein to bind to ?-catenin through the APC 20-amino-acid (20AA) repeats, thus providing a biochemical explanation for the precise truncations found in cancer cells. We also show that most of the ?-catenin phosphorylation activity is associated with a dense insoluble fraction. We finally examine the impact of full-length and truncated APC on ?-catenin nuclear transport. We observe that ?-catenin is transported much faster than previously thought. Although this fast translocation is largely insensitive to the presence of wild-type or truncated APC, the two forms appear to limit the pool of ?-catenin that is available for transport, which could have an impact on ?-catenin nuclear activities in normal and cancer cells.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496450","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.75392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Adenomatous polyposis coli","weight":0.538878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomatous_polyposis_coli"},{"name":"Familial adenomatous polyposis","weight":0.327711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_adenomatous_polyposis"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.311438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.185466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.138662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Nuclear localization signal","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_localization_signal"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.102962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Nuclear transport","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transport"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Export","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Harbor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Demonstration (people)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(people)"},{"name":"Import","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"},{"name":"Polyposis","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyposis"},{"name":"Truncation (geometry)","weight":0.015821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry)"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"}]}
