{"id":67731,"title":"Evaluation of renal protective effects of inhibiting TGF-? type I receptor in a cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity model.","abstract":"The use of cisplatin, the first of the platinum-containing anti-cancer drugs, is limited by the development of a myriad of adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity. We conducted this study therefore to find out whether SB-431542, potent and specific inhibitor of type I transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGF-?R1), could prevent or attenuate kidney damage in rats, and to elucidate its possible mechanism of action.Fifty rats were treated with cisplatin (10 mg/kg) in the presence (1 and 3 mg/kg) or absence of SB-431542. Morphological changes were assessed in kidney sections stained with H/E. Oxidative stress was evaluated in kidney homogenates by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Kidney samples were used for measurements of TGF-?R1, TGF-?1 and sCD93 by ELISA. Kidney tissue apoptosis was assessed by measuring caspase-3 activity.The renal protective effect of SB-431542 was confirmed by the normal appearance of renal tissue and the relatively unaffected serum creatinine and urea levels. With SB-431542, there was significantly lower renal MDA and increased SOD compared with the cisplatin group. Furthermore, in the SB-431542 group, renal TGF-?R1, TGF-?1, sCD93 and caspase-3 levels were significantly lower.Inhibition of TGF-?R1 provides protective effects against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity through several mechanisms, including attenuation of oxidative stress, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, blocking of renal fibrosis markers, and anti-apoptotic effects.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24590376","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.875198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.803965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.725258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.669567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.668312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.512388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.342095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.279237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.276854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.124458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}]}
