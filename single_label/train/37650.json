{"id":37650,"title":"A novel translational model of percutaneous fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion - baboons (Papio spp.).","abstract":"Percutaneous fetoscopic endoluminal reversible tracheal occlusion (FETO) was developed to prevent the pulmonary complications of fetal congenital diaphragmatic herniation. There is an urgent need to establish the closest to human translational model of FETO in order to improve fetal outcomes and to determine new clinical approaches and applications.Seven non-human primates underwent two subsequent surgeries: the first, the FETO in the experimental group (n = 3) or sham operation in the control animals (S-FETO, n = 4) at 132-142 days of gestation (dGA); the second, the reversal of occlusion or sham operation at 162 ± 5 dGA. Maternal stress axis, complete blood count, and biochemical parameters were evaluated and newborn tracheal radiography was performed.The average pregnancy duration and neonatal weights in the FETO group did not differ from the animals in the S-FETO group. There was no bleeding or premature fetal membrane rupture during the procedures in any of the baboons. The maximal tracheal width was 7.02 ± 0.6 mm in the FETO versus 5.46 ± 0.6 mm in S-FETO group.This is the very first report of a successful FETO model in non-human primates. Similarities to human tracheomegaly were for the first time documented in any model studied.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480792","annotations":[{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.748652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.645747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.558325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.537185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.305801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Baboon","weight":0.281463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baboon"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Fetoscopy","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetoscopy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"}]}
