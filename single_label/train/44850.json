{"id":44850,"title":"Identification of Zinc Finger, MYM-type 2 (ZMYM2) as a regulator of sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy with a very complex molecular process. There is no successful therapy for advanced HCC at present. Recently, sorafenib has been used as a systemic therapy to improve survival in patients with advanced HCC, but increasing reports of recurrence or non-responsiveness indicate the limitations of sorafenib as a therapeutic agent. Therefore, identification of genes involved in sorafenib resistance is important to effectively treat advanced HCC.We performed a genomic screening with a short-hairpin RNA library cassette on HCC cell lines to find genes relating resistance to sorafenib.Zinc finger, MYM type 2 (ZMYM2) was sequenced after three successive screens in vitro as a challengeable target. The inhibition of ZMYM2 resulted in sorafenib-resistance in formerly sensitive HCC cell lines. Immunohistochemical comparison of tumor and non-tumor regions showed stronger ZMYM2 staining intensities in non-tumor regions than in tumor regions.ZMYM2 may play an important role in sorafenib resistance.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716227","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.746354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Zinc finger","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_finger"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.638817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.455117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.410454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.385626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Systemic therapy","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_therapy"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"Genetic screen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_screen"},{"name":"Psychedelic therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy"},{"name":"MeetYourMakers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeetYourMakers"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
