{"id":66309,"title":"Evolution and immediate future of US screening guidelines.","abstract":"Although observational studies and simulation models have shed some interesting light on many of the uncertainties surrounding prostate cancer screening, well-done clinical trials provide the best evidence on screening among the extremes of age, the most appropriate interval to screen, and the best complement of tests to use. Enthusiasm for screening is temporized by the acknowledgment that overdetection leads to frequent overtreatment despite evidence supporting the safety of active surveillance in many men with low-risk disease.
