{"id":63415,"title":"Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas in children: surgical intervention strategies based on pathological findings.","abstract":"The appropriate surgical intervention strategies for solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas in children are still controversial. The aim of this study was to establish surgical intervention strategies based on the pathological findings.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent surgery for SPT between January 1994 and April 2013.Five patients with SPT were identified. Tumors were located in the pancreatic head (n = 1), body (n = 2) and tail (n = 2). One patient showed spleen, liver and lung metastases. All five patients underwent pancreatectomy. Enucleation was not performed. One patient with metastases underwent partial hepatectomy. Four tumors had infiltration into the adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. The main pancreatic duct was incorporated into the tumor capsule wall in two patients. Surgical margins were negative in all patients without metastases. The median follow-up period was 37.8 months (range 7-74 months). One patient with metastases died at 60 months after surgery. All other patients were alive and showed no evidence of recurrence.Radical resection with negative margins should be performed for SPT. From the perspective of curability, we suggest that pancreatectomy is the first choice for SPT in children.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442211","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.878309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.554162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.480203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.460502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"}]}
