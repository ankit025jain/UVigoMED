{"id":86445,"title":"Bone morphogenetic protein-focused strategies to induce cytotoxicity in lung cancer cells.","abstract":"High bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 expression in lung carcinoma correlates with poor patient prognosis. The present study explored strategies to repress BMP signaling.The cytotoxicity of BMP2-knockdown, dorsomorphin derivatives, and microRNAs was tested in transformed and non-transformed lung cells. Microarray analyses of 1,145 microRNAs in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and two other transformed lung cell types relative to BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells were performed.Reduced BMP2 synthesis inhibited A549 cell growth. The dorsomorphin derivative LDN-193189, but not DMH1 or DMH4, was strongly cytotoxic towards A549 cells, but not towards BEAS-2B cells. Microarray analysis revealed that 106 miRNAs were down-regulated and 69 miRNAs were up-regulated in the three transformed lines. Three down-regulated miRNAs, hsa-mir-34b, hsa-mir-34c-3p, and hsa-miR-486-3p, repressed a BMP2 reporter gene and were cytotoxic in A549 cells, but not towards BEAS-2B cells.The observed cytotoxicity suggests that reducing BMP signaling is a useful line of attack for therapy of lung cancer.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778011","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.821901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Bronchus","weight":0.804684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.785599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.67253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.477896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.462795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Reporter gene","weight":0.346139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter_gene"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.237687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.129115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Electron configuration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"}]}
