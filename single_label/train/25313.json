{"id":25313,"title":"[Effect of yanggan yishui granule on collagen I, III, and IV, and FN in spontaneously hypertensive rats].","abstract":"To observe the effect of Yanggan Yishui Granule (YGYSG) on collagen protein I, III, and IV, as well as fibronection (EN) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and to explore its possible renal protective mechanisms.Fourty SHR were randomly divided into four groups, i.e., the model group, the Benazepril group, the low dose YGYSG group, and the high dose YGYSG group, 10 in each group. A normal control group was set up with recruited Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. After 6 weeks of treatment, the expression of collagen protein I, III, and IV, as well as FN in the 5.1 image analysis system.In the WKY-control group, there was only a small amount of brown particles in the mesenchymal region, the glomerular basement membrane, or the mesangial region. The expression of collagen I, Ill, and IV, as well as EN significantly increased more in the model group than in the normal control group (P < 0.01). After treatment, the expression of collagen I, III, and IV, as well as FN significantly decreased in each treated group, showing statistical difference when compared with the model group (P < 0.01). Besides, decresed expression of collagen I, III, and IV was shown in the low dose YGYSG group and the Benazepril group (P > 0.05). The expression of collagen I, III, and IV could be further reduced in the high dose YGYSG group, showing statistical difference when compared with the Benazepril group and the low dose YGYSG group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).YGYSG might play an important role in the renal protective effect through reducing the synthesis of renal collagen I, III, and IV, as well as FN, increasing the degradation of renal collagen I, III, and IV, as well as FN, thereby reducing excessive deposition of renal extracellular matrix (ECM).","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Cardiovascular
