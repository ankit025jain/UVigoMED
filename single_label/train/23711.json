{"id":23711,"title":"Comparative study of free omental sheet graft and other operative procedures of enteric perforation repair.","abstract":"In developing countries, enteric perforation due to typhoid continues to have very high morbidity and mortality rates irrespective of the type of operative procedure performed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a free omental sheet graft in perforated typhoid enteritis, in comparison to other methods of enteric perforation repair in terms of decreased morbidity, mortality and cost-effectiveness.A non-randomized study of 114 patients with enteric perforations was carried out over a period of 4.5 years. The study was divided in two groups; group I includes 38 cases in which a free omental sheet graft was used in typhoid enteritis with perforation and group II includes 76 cases in which other surgical procedures for enteric perforation repair were used. The outcomes were measured in relation to postoperative complications and mortality.The incidence of complications including faecal fistula was 2.6% in group I (free omental sheet graft group) versus 32.89% in group II. The mortality rate of 2.6% was also lower in group I versus 19.7% in group II.This study concludes that the use of free omental sheet graft on typhoid enteric perforation site is effective in lowering the repair leak rate and thereby decreases the morbidity and mortality associated with these procedures. By lowering the complication rates, it also entails reduction in financial burden.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474632","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.814871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.768176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.688483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.677023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Typhoid fever","weight":0.63852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enteritis","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteritis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
