The sample was composed of healthy patients who were admitted for bimaxillary osteotomies and were assigned to 1 of 2 groups by a computer-generated random number and blinded to the group. Dexmedetomidine or nitroglycerin was used as the hypotensive drug for each group. All patients underwent hypotensive anesthesia and surgery according to standard protocol. Intraoperative amount of fentanyl, time to eye opening, time to follow basic verbal commands, time to extubation, early postoperative pain scores, and analgesics were recorded. Compared means were analyzed using the unpaired Student t test. A 2-sided statistical test was used. A P value less than .05 was considered significant.The sample was composed of 40 participants. The intraoperative fentanyl requirement was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the nitroglycerin group (168.75±56.29 and 222.50±96.12 ?g, respectively; P=.037). Times to eye opening and following commands were considerably longer in the dexmedetomidine group, but the time to extubation showed no meaningful difference. Early postoperative pain after 30 and 60 minutes and the requirement for meperidine were not meaningfully different between the 2 groups.Dexmedetomidine, used as a hypotensive drug, has anesthetic benefits compared with nitroglycerin. Dexmedetomidine decreases the intraoperative fentanyl requirement and does not meaningfully change the time to extubation, early postoperative pain, and analgesic drug requirement.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308408","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Nitroglycerin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin"},{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Pethidine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pethidine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.702154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.577528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.116316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0575759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Orthognathic surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery"},{"name":"Dexmedetomidine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexmedetomidine"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"60 Minutes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"}]}
