{"id":46928,"title":"Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma: a rare tumor at the esophagogastric junction and an unexpected durable complete response to FOLFOX-4.","abstract":"Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) is a high-grade variant of squamous cell carcinoma usually localized in the aerodigestive tract, with a poor prognosis. Surgical resection is generally recommended, even if no standard treatment has been established yet.Here, we report the case history of a patient diagnosed with BSCC at the esophagogastric junction who was successfully treated with chemotherapy alone, leading to a durable complete response.The presented case illustrates the diagnostic challenges associated with BSCC of the esophagus and reports an unexpected chemosensitivity of this histotype to the combination of a platinum salt plus 5-fluorouracil, which could represent an optimal treatment strategy in unfit patients.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613910","annotations":[{"name":"FOLFOX","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOLFOX"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.730506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.424541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.143667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"}]}
