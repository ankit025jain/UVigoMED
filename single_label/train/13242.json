{"id":13242,"title":"Antinociceptive effect of certain dimethoxy flavones in mice.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antinociceptive action of certain dimethoxy flavones (DMF, (7,2?-dimethoxy flavone, 7,3?-dimethoxy flavone, 7,4?-dimethoxy flavone and 7,8,-dimethoxy flavone) and the possible mechanisms involved. The antinociceptive effect of dimethoxy flavones was investigated in mice employing acetic acid-induced abdominal writhings, formalin-induced nociception and hot water tail immersion assay procedures. To identify the possible mechanisms involved in the antinociceptive action of these compounds, acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction assay alone was employed. Mice were pretreated with naloxone, yohimbine, ondansetron, haloperidol, bicuculline or glibenclamide before dimethoxy flavone treatment to identify the role of opioid, adrenergic, 5HT3-serotonergic, dopaminergic, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor or potassium channels, respectively. The investigated dimethoxy flavones produced a significant reduction in the number of abdominal constrictions in acetic acid assay. A dose dependent decrease in paw-licking response time was evident in both the early and late phases of formalin induced nociception. A significant increase in reaction time was also evident after treatment with various dimethoxy flavones in hot water tail immersion assay. Pretreatment with naloxone, ondansetron or glibenclamide significantly attenuated the antinociceptive effect of all the four dimethoxy flavones. Yohimbine pretreatment attenuated the antinociceptive response of 7,3?-dimethoxy flavone, 7,4?-dimethoxy flavone and 7,8-dimethoxy flavone. Pretreatment with haloperidol potentiated the antinociceptive response of all the tested dimethoxy flavones. The antinociceptive effect of 7,2?-dimethoxy flavone and 7,3?-dimethoxy flavone was annulled by bicuculline pretreatment. The results of the present study reveal the antinociceptive effect of dimethoxy flavones involving multiple pathways.
