{"id":17126,"title":"[When the scientific career favors the scholarly diffusion of innovation: doctor Max Fourestier].","abstract":"In 1992, the hospital of Nanterre assumed Max Fourestier's surname, as this great doctor was in office there between 1948 and 1973. Max Fourestier's biography and career emphasize that he embarked on three specific professional fields : specialty medicine, social medicine and school medicine. At the time, Max Fourestier was developing his universal endoscope in his department in Nanterre, achieving an extensive experience of massive BCG vaccination in a tuberculosis clinic in Montreuil, called \"social hygiene\" and, finally, carrying out a lot of school innovations to achieve an equal division of time between school work and sport practices. He also implemented snow classes in public schools in 1953 or napping classes,forest classes and snow classes in infant schools in 1959. In short, this presentation reveals that the inherent process of Max Fourestier's school innovation reputation lies in the scientific will of its creator, which allows him to convey his teaching ideas at the international level. Finally, in addition to the inventory of the physician's various innovations, the major challenge of this presentation is to reveal the intertwining and strong connections of Max Fourestier's medical and school commitments.
