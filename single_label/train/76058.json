{"id":76058,"title":"[Evaluation on the effectiveness of intervention comprehensive program on child obesity, using Generalized Estimating Equation].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of child obesity intervention comprehensive program on the improvement of overweight, obese control and knowledge-attitude-practice.The study design was under cluster-randomized controlled trial, with 965 children in the intervention and 895 children in the control groups. Repeated measurement data on child obesity was analyzed through Generalized Estimating Equation models.The risk of becoming overweight or obesity in the intervention group was 0.824 times more than children in the control group, showing a reduction of 17.6% the risk of being overweight or obese (P = 0.031). In addition, the possibility of increasing one unit of correct rate on obesity related knowledge, children in the intervention group children was 1.044 times (P = 0.001)than in the control group. On the mean obesity related correct attitude rate, it was 1.023 times (P = 0.001) in the intervention group of the control group. Regarding the possibility of increasing one unit om the mean obesity related behavior score, children in the intervention group was 1.522 times (P = 0.001)than those in the control group (P = 0.046).The comprehensive child obesity intervention program could effectively reduce the risk of developing overweight or obesity and improving the obesity related knowledge, attitude and behavior in children.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294064","annotations":[{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.601684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.562172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.440443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.241325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.186252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"824","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/824"},{"name":"965","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/965"},{"name":"895","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/895"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
