{"id":29869,"title":"The association between changes in alternative reinforcers and short-term smoking cessation.","abstract":"While more than 50% of smokers make a serious quit attempt each year, less than 10% quit permanently. Evidence from studies of adolescent smoking and other substances of abuse suggest that alternative reinforcers, a construct of Behavioral Economic Theory, may contribute to the likelihood of smoking cessation in adults. This study examined the behavioral economics of smoking cessation within a smoking cessation clinical trial and evaluated how depressive symptoms and behavioral economic variables are associated with smoking cessation.A sample of 469 smokers, enrolled in an effectiveness trial that provided counseling and 8 weeks of 21 mg nicotine patches, was analyzed. Alternative reinforcers (substitute and complementary reinforcers) and depressive symptoms were examined in relation to 7-day point prevalence abstinence, verified with breath carbon monoxide, 8 weeks after the quit date.Controlling for covariates associated with cessation (nicotine dependence, age of smoking initiation, patch adherence), participants who were abstinent at week 8 showed significantly higher substitute reinforcers at all time-points, compared to those who were smoking (p's<.05). Participants who were abstinent at week 8 showed lower complementary reinforcers and depressive symptoms at all time-points, compared to those who were smoking, but significant differences were confined to week 8 (p's<.01). There was no significant interaction between alternative reinforcers and depressive symptoms across the 8 weeks on week 8 abstinence.These results support continued examination of Behavioral Economic Theory in understanding adult smoking cessation in order to inform future treatments and guidelines.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598122","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.725549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.613322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Nicotine patch","weight":0.599309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_patch"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.572256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Behavioral economics","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.340757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.328977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Transdermal patch","weight":0.138706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal_patch"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.120226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Pseudonym","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
