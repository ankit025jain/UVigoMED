{"id":63838,"title":"[A case of cancer in the dilated jejunal pouch after total gastrectomy].","abstract":"We report a case of cancer in the dilated jejunal pouch after total gastrectomy, in which we resected the jejunal pouch. The patient was a man in his 60s and had a history of total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch ?-interposition for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in 1994. In late July 2012, he presented to the emergency department with a protracted ileus-like symptom and was admitted to the gastroenterological department after the diagnosis of a dilated jejunal pouch. He was managed conservatively; however, the same symptom recurred. Examinations showed a duodenal carcinoma and cancer in the jejunal pouch; therefore, he was referred for digestive surgery in early August. Endoscopic mucosal resection( EMR) was performed on the duodenal carcinoma, and we resected the jejunal pouch with Roux-en-Y reconstruction for the jejunal cancer. He recovered from postoperative wound infection and was discharged 15 days after the second operation.
