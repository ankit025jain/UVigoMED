{"id":42833,"title":"MicroRNA-27a modulates HCV infection in differentiated hepatocyte-like cells from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells.","abstract":"Despite the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry factor, the mechanism by which it is regulated by miRNAs remains unclear. Adipose tissue-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (AT-hMSCs) have been widely used for differentiated hepatocyte-like cells (DHCs). Here, we established an in vitro HCV infection model using DHCs from AT-hMSCs and identified miRNAs that modulate HCV infectivity.AT-hMSCs were differentiated into DHCs using the conditional media, and evaluated for hepatocyte characteristics using RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and a urea synthesis assay. The expression of HCV candidate receptors was also verified using immunocytochemistry. The levels of candidate miRNAs targeting HCV receptors were then determined by relative quantitative RT-PCR (rqRT-PCR). Finally, DHCs were infected using HCVcc and serum from HCV-infected patients, and infectivity of the virus was measured by rqRT-PCR and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).The expected changes in morphology, function and hepatic gene expression were observed during hepatic differentiation. Moreover, the expression of candidate HCV entry factors and miR-27a were altered during hepatic differentiation. The infection and replication of HCV occurred efficiently in DHCs treated with HCVcc or infected with serum from HCV-infected patients. In addition, HCV infectivity was suppressed in miR-27a-transfected DHCs, due to the inhibition of LDLR expression by miR-27a.Our results demonstrate that AT-hMSCs are a good source of DHCs, which are suitable for in vitro cultivation of HCV. Furthermore, these results suggest that miR-27a modulates HCV infectivity by regulating LDLR expression.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824429","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.851266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.775245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.741133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.71083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.69992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.644638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.620859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.545002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"LDL receptor","weight":0.403909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDL_receptor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.264844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.154683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
