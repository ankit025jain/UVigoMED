{"id":23540,"title":"Lung ultrasound in community-acquired pneumonia and in interstitial lung diseases.","abstract":"Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an accurate tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of pneumonia in adults as well as in children. LUS is at least as accurate as chest radiography in diagnosing pneumonia. The most important parenchymal criterion is the positive air bronchogram within an echopoor area. Among pleural criteria, basal effusion was most often detected. The presence of multiple diffuse bilateral B-lines on lung examination indicates the interstitial syndrome (IS). For further differential diagnosis, an integrated consideration of history, clinical examination, LUS and echocardiography should be performed. LUS is an excellent tool for IS screening. Repeated LUS control examinations may reflect the dynamics of IS under therapy and so LUS may serve as a therapy guide. .","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481027","annotations":[{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.44856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0268965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
