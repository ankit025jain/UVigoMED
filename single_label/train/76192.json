{"id":76192,"title":"Glucagon-like peptide-2 regulates release of chylomicrons from the intestine.","abstract":"The intestine efficiently incorporates and rapidly secretes dietary fat as chylomicrons (lipoprotein particles comprising triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins) that contain the apolipoprotein isoform apoB-48. The gut can store lipids for many hours after their ingestion, and release them in chylomicrons in response to oral glucose, sham feeding, or unidentified stimuli. The gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) facilitates intestinal absorption of lipids, but its role in chylomicron secretion in human beings is unknown.We performed a randomized, single-blind, cross-over study, with 2 study visits 4 weeks apart, to assess the effects of GLP-2 administration on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) apoB-48 in 6 healthy men compared with placebo. Subjects underwent constant intraduodenal feeding, with a pancreatic clamp and primed constant infusion of deuterated leucine. In a separate randomized, single-blind, cross-over validation study, 6 additional healthy men ingested a high-fat meal containing retinyl palmitate and were given either GLP-2 or placebo 7 hours later with measurement of TRL triglyceride, TRL retinyl palmitate, and TRL apoB-48 levels.GLP-2 administration resulted in a rapid (within 30 minutes) and transient increase in the concentration of TRL apoB-48, compared with placebo (P = .03). Mathematic modeling of stable isotope enrichment and the mass of the TRL apoB-48 suggested that the increase resulted from the release of stored, presynthesized apoB-48 from the gut. In the validation study, administration of GLP-2 at 7 hours after the meal, in the absence of additional food intake, robustly increased levels of TRL triglycerides (P = .007), TRL retinyl palmitate (P = .002), and TRL apoB-48 (P = .04) compared with placebo.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25173752","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.812764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.747018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.738291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Phospholipid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.720444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Leucine","weight":0.709729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.701041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Palmitic acid","weight":0.691628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Retinol","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.578454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.557917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.546762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Chylomicron","weight":0.438889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chylomicron"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein B","weight":0.23008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_B"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.0849953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Retinyl palmitate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinyl_palmitate"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Presidency of George W.
