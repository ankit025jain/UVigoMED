{"id":76443,"title":"Islet-1 Is essential for pancreatic ?-cell function.","abstract":"Islet-1 (Isl-1) is essential for the survival and ensuing differentiation of pancreatic endocrine progenitors. Isl-1 remains expressed in all adult pancreatic endocrine lineages; however, its specific function in the postnatal pancreas is unclear. Here we determine whether Isl-1 plays a distinct role in the postnatal ?-cell by performing physiological and morphometric analyses of a tamoxifen-inducible, ?-cell-specific Isl-1 loss-of-function mouse: Isl-1(L/L); Pdx1-CreER(Tm). Ablating Isl-1 in postnatal ?-cells reduced glucose tolerance without significantly reducing ?-cell mass or increasing ?-cell apoptosis. Rather, islets from Isl-1(L/L); Pdx1-CreER(Tm) mice showed impaired insulin secretion. To identify direct targets of Isl-1, we integrated high-throughput gene expression and Isl-1 chromatin occupancy using islets from Isl-1(L/L); Pdx1-CreER(Tm) mice and ?TC3 insulinoma cells, respectively. Ablating Isl-1 significantly affected the ?-cell transcriptome, including known targets Insulin and MafA as well as novel targets Pdx1 and Slc2a2. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and luciferase reporter assays, we found that Isl-1 directly occupies functional regulatory elements of Pdx1 and Slc2a2. Thus Isl-1 is essential for postnatal ?-cell function, directly regulates Pdx1 and Slc2a2, and has a mature ?-cell cistrome distinct from that of pancreatic endocrine progenitors.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028525","annotations":[{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chromatin","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Insulinoma","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulinoma"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.798844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Regulatory sequence","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_sequence"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.657333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.582528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.575092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.560168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"PDX1","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDX1"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.142583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Chromatin immunoprecipitation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin_immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Integrase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrase"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
