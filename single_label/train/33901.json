{"id":33901,"title":"Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism and serum lipid profile in Saudi patients with psoriasis.","abstract":"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene variants have been reported to influence psoriasis risk. However, data is limited to a few ethnicities and no similar study has been performed in middle eastern populations. We investigated this association in Saudi psoriasis patients.Saudi subjects (294) were genotyped for APOE gene using APOE StripAssay kit.The frequencies of alleles ?2, ?4, and genotypes ?3/?4 and ?3/?2 were significantly higher in psoriasis patients compared with those in controls. The frequency of ?3 allele and ?3/?3 genotype was significantly lower in patients. Other genotypes, ?2/?4, ?2/?2, and ?4/?4, were absent in both groups. The serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL levels were significantly higher in psoriasis patients contrary to HDL level. Patients with APOE ? 4 had significantly higher levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, whereas those with the ?2 had higher HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.APOE alleles ?2, ?4, and genotypes ?2/?3 and ?4/?3 are associated with psoriasis and can be a risk factor while allele ?3 and genotype ?3/?3 may be protective for psoriasis in Saudis. Results of lipid profile support that psoriasis is one of the independent risk factors for hyperlipidemia and emphasize the need of screening cardiovascular diseases in psoriatic patients.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782577","annotations":[{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.797516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.623615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.493689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.0418311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Middle East","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
