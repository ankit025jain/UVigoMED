{"id":92260,"title":"[[On evaluation of public health state in Aral Sea area].","abstract":"Inefficient and excessive use of water of Aral Sea Basin for the period of 40 years for agricultural land irrigation caused a significant deterioration of living conditions, changed the economic situation of the local population, its income, employment, working conditions, infrastructure of livelihood. All these components manifested in a sudden change of health status of population in Aral Sea area. Research project will help to develop a methodology for risk assessment and management, identify patterns of damage to various body systems and the rationale of diagnostic criteria for ecologically dependent diseases at the early stage, and to implement preventive and corrective actions to determine the conditions for the preservation of public health in environmental deviations of the habitat of the population living in the Aral Sea area.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Disorders of Environmental Origin","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549450","annotations":[{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.696761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Habitat","weight":0.621475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.594954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.53395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Aral Sea","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.360187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.260136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.169122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.129769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.0516919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Late-2000s recession","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Pattern recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition"},{"name":"Road surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_surface"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Livelihood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livelihood"}]}
