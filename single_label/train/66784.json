{"id":66784,"title":"Effect of antioxidants on outcome of testicular torsion in rats of different ages.","abstract":"We assessed reproductive and testicular function in adult rats after testicular torsion created before, during and after puberty, and with vs without resveratrol or arginine treatment.Age matched rats were divided into groups, including simulated surgery without testicular torsion, 720-degree testicular torsion for 4 hours, testicular torsion with resveratrol treatment and testicular torsion with arginine treatment. To study reproductive function at age 12 weeks each rat mated with 3 females. The males were sacrificed at age 14 weeks. Spermatozoids were collected from the epididymal tail and evaluated for concentration, motility and viability. Testicular samples were collected for morphological analysis.Reproductive function was not altered by testicular torsion but antioxidants improved potency. Compared to sham operated and contralateral samples all spermatozoid parameters from testicular torsion samples were inferior. Resveratrol and arginine did not improve spermatozoid quality or quantity in torsed testes but contralateral samples were improved by each drug. The seminiferous epithelium of rats submitted to testicular torsion during puberty was least affected. Each antioxidant partially to totally prevented the morphological alterations found in rats with untreated testicular torsion. Rats submitted to testicular torsion before puberty that were treated with antioxidants showed the fewest changes.Testicular morphology was altered less in rats when torsion occurred earlier in life, that is during puberty. Treatment with antioxidants improved contralateral spermatozoid production and some fertility parameters. Each antioxidant also prevented testicular morphology alterations after testicular torsion. Prepubertal rats benefited most from antioxidant treatment.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679870","annotations":[{"name":"Spermatozoon","weight":0.891569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.821322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Testicular torsion","weight":0.810907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_torsion"},{"name":"Seminiferous tubule","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminiferous_tubule"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Mating","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.748069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Epididymis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epididymis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.523117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.382766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.339162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Resveratrol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Softcore pornography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softcore_pornography"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"}]}
