{"id":66124,"title":"Minoxidil may suppress androgen receptor-related functions.","abstract":"Although minoxidil has been used for more than two decades to treat androgenetic alopecia (AGA), an androgen-androgen receptor (AR) pathway-dominant disease, its precise mechanism of action remains elusive. We hypothesized that minoxidil may influence the AR or its downstream signaling. These tests revealed that minoxidil suppressed AR-related functions, decreasing AR transcriptional activity in reporter assays, reducing expression of AR targets at the protein level, and suppressing AR-positive LNCaP cell growth. Dissecting the underlying mechanisms, we found that minoxidil interfered with AR-peptide, AR-coregulator, and AR N/C-terminal interactions, as well as AR protein stability. Furthermore, a crystallographic analysis using the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) revealed direct binding of minoxidil to the AR in a minoxidil-AR-LBD co-crystal model, and surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that minoxidil directly bound the AR with a K(d) value of 2.6 ÂµM. Minoxidil also suppressed AR-responsive reporter activity and decreased AR protein stability in human hair dermal papilla cells. The current findings provide evidence that minoxidil could be used to treat both cancer and age-related disease, and open a new avenue for applications of minoxidil in treating androgen-AR pathway-related diseases.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742982","annotations":[{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.718375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.556612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.528375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Androgenic alopecia","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_alopecia"},{"name":"Minoxidil","weight":0.300301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoxidil"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.279991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.21346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Crystallography","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Advanced_Graphics_Architecture"},{"name":"Plasmon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon"},{"name":"LNCaP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNCaP"},{"name":"Dermal papillae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermal_papillae"},{"name":"Surface plasmon resonance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_plasmon_resonance"},{"name":"Reporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Little black dress","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_black_dress"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Surface plasmon","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_plasmon"}]}
