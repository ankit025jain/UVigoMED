{"id":72295,"title":"Second primary malignancies in adult acute myeloid leukemia--A US population-based study.","abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Long-term survivors from AML may be at higher risk of second primary malignancies.We selected adult patients with AML aged?18 years from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End RESULTS (SEER 13) database. We used the multiple primary standardized incidence ratio session of SEER*stat software to calculate the risk of second primary malignancies in patients with AML.Among 5,091 patients, 148 patients developed a total of 160 second primary malignancies, with an observed/expected (O/E) ratio of 1.17, (95% confidence interval=0.99-1.36), and an excess risk of 15.47 per 10,000 population. The risk of all-site cancer, cancer of gastrointestinal system, and oral and pharyngeal cancer in different age groups was found to be significantly higher among patients with AML compared to that of general US population.Adult patients with AML have a significantly higher risk of second primary malignancies compared to the general population.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982414","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.772537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.737533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.659725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.582906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"List of U.S. states and territories by population","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_Epidemiology_and_End_Results"},{"name":"Old English","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
