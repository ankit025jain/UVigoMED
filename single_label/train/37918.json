{"id":37918,"title":"[Changes in T lymphocyte subsets in preterm infants with intrauterine growth retardation].","abstract":"To study changes in T lymphocyte subsets in preterm infants with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).The study enrolled 29 IUGR preterm infants, 38 preterm infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA), and 20 healthy full-term infants. Peripheral blood was sampled during the first 24 hours of life, and again at a corrected age of 38 weeks of the preterm infants. T lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry, and absolute counts of leukocytes, total lymphocytes, and T lymphocytes were determined with an automated hematology analyzer.Within the first 24 hours of life, percentages of CD3(+) and CD4(+) were lower in IUGR preterm infants than in AGA preterm infants and full-term infants (P<0.05), percentages of CD8(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio were lower in IUGR preterm infants than in full-term infants (P<0.05), and percentages of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio were lower in AGA preterm infants than in full-term infants (P<0.05). Moreover, the absolute counts of total lymphocytes were lower in IUGR preterm infants than in full-term infants (P<0.05); the absolute counts of T lymphocytes were lower in preterm infants, regardless of IUGR, than in full-term infants (P<0.05), and lower in IUGR infants than in AGA infants (P<0.05). At the corrected age of 38 weeks, percentages of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio were increased in both IUGR and AGA infants as compared to the measurements within the first 24 hours of life (P<0.05), and percentages of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio were lower in IUGR infants than in AGA infants (P<0.05), whereas there were no significant differences in counts of leukocytes, total lymphocytes and T lymphocytes between IUGR and AGA infants (P>0.05).There may be a certain degree of compromise in cell-mediated immunity in preterm infants with IUGR and this compromise may last to 38 weeks after birth.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461174","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.885234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.871324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.862549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.58316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Intrauterine growth restriction","weight":0.388198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.340579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Delayed milestone","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_milestone"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Advanced_Graphics_Architecture"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"}]}
