{"id":43804,"title":"External beam radiotherapy ± chemotherapy in the treatment of anal canal cancer: a single-institute long-term experience on 100 patients.","abstract":"One-hundred patients treated with curative radiotherapy (RT) ± chemotherapy (CT) for an anal canal carcinoma (T1-4N0-3M0) were retrospectively analyzed. Five- and 10-year local control (LC) rates were 73% and 67%, respectively. Acute and late G3-G4 toxicity rates were 32% and 12%, respectively. Two patients underwent a colostomy for a G4 anal toxicity. This study confirms the outcomes of RT ± CT in the treatment of anal canal cancer. Concomitant CT and LC statistically influenced Overall Survival and Colostomy-Free Survival. CT also statistically reduced the risk of nodal relapse. High rates of acute skin toxicity impose tailored volumes and techniques of irradiation.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766302","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.843595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.621393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.581534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.553862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Colostomy","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostomy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.26615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.190212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"3G","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"},{"name":"G4 (TV channel)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Anal canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_canal"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Natural satellite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"},{"name":"Transmitter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter"},{"name":"Top 14","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_14"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"M0 motorway (Hungary)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M0_motorway_(Hungary)"}]}
