{"id":29832,"title":"Schedules of controlled substances: temporary placement of four synthetic cannabinoids into Schedule I. Final order.","abstract":"The Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this final order to temporarily schedule four synthetic cannabinoids into schedule I pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The substances are: Quinolin-8-yl 1-pentyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate (PB-22; QUPIC); quinolin-8-yl 1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxylate (5-fluoro-PB-22; 5F-PB-22); N-(1-amino-3-methyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (AB-FUBINACA); and N-(1-amino-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-pentyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (ADB-PINACA). This action is based on a finding by the Deputy Administrator that the placement of these synthetic cannabinoids and their optical, positional, and geometric isomers, salts and salts of isomers into schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this order, the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances will be imposed on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities, and possess), or propose to handle these synthetic cannabinoids.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced
