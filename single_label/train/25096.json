{"id":25096,"title":"[Individual selection of immunocorrector in surgical treatment of obliterating atherosclerosis of the aorta and its branches].","abstract":"The method for individual selection of immunocorrector in surgical treatment of patients, suffering obliterating atherosclerosis of abdominal aorta and its branches, was proposed. There were examined 69 patients, suffering affection of abdominal aorta and its branches. Inhibition of phagocytic function of neutrophils was observed; on background of activation of the oxygen-dependent metabolism; decompensation of the phagocytic cells function, not depending from the disease stage present. Introduction of the proposed method for the immunocorrector selection secures rising of the diagnosis accuracy and the immunotherapy efficacy.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252411","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.683964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Phagocyte","weight":0.432953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocyte"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.414693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Abdominal aorta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aorta"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Affection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
