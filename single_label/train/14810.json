{"id":14810,"title":"ErbB receptors and their growth factor ligands in pediatric intestinal inflammation.","abstract":"The ErbB tyrosine kinases (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) are cell surface growth factor receptors widely expressed in many developing mammalian tissues, including in the intestinal tract. Signaling elicited by these receptors promotes epithelial cell growth and survival, and ErbB ligands have been proposed as therapeutic agents for intestinal diseases of pediatric populations, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and inflammation associated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Furthermore, emerging evidence points to reduced ErbB ligand expression and thus reduced ErbB activity in IBD, NEC, and TPN models. This review will discuss the current understanding of the role of ErbB receptors in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of pediatric intestinal inflammation, with focus on the altered signaling in disease and the molecular mechanisms by which exogenous ligands are protective.
