The role of feeding practices in causation of ECC is debated. The objective of this study was to assess the aetiological role of feeding practices on ECC. A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted at a paediatric unit in Sri Lanka. Two hundred and eighty-five children between 36 to 60 months, admitted to the unit were randomly selected for the study. An interviewer administered questionnaire asked about socio-demographic characteristics and feeding practices. The mouths of children were examined for dental caries. Out of 285 children, 61% had exclusive breast feeding up to six months, 69% continued breast feeding beyond two years and 82% had overnight feeding after two years of age. One hundred and thirty-six children (47.7%) had dental caries with a mean deft score of 1.81. Overnight feeding with any type of milk beyond two years significantly increased dental caries incidence and severity. Children exclusively breast fed for six months or had breast feeding beyond two years had a higher prevalence of caries than children not exclusively breast fed or who were not breast feed beyond two years, but the difference was not significant. Overnight feeding with any type of milk beyond two years should be discouraged.
