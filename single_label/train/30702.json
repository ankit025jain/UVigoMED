{"id":30702,"title":"[Recent life events preceding suicide attempt by drug overdose].","abstract":"Recent stressful life events (ASLE) are considered to be one of the factors precipitating suicidal behavior. They precede a suicide attempt in most cases and according to research occur more often during the month or week before the suicide attempt. Interpersonal events are most common. The article presents an analysis of ASLE timing and incidence of events from specific categories during the month preceding suicide attempt by drug overdose. 124 patients admitted to the hospital because of suicidal intoxication were included in the study. Data regarding ASLE were collected with the use of a structured interview. Majority of patients attempting suicide by drug overdose experience a stressful event during the month prior to the suicide attempt. Nearly 4 out of 10 study subjects experience a stressful event on the day of the attempt or on the preceding day. Most common events that occur during the month prior to the attempt and immediately before the attempt are interpersonal events and most of them are related to relationships with spouses or partners.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466692","annotations":[{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.428827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.319198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Structured interview","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_interview"},{"name":"Failed suicide attempt","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_suicide_attempt"}]}
