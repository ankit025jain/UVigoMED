{"id":91174,"title":"The effect of cognitive task complexity on gait stability in adolescents following concussion.","abstract":"Concussion has been reported to result in disturbances to motor and cognitive functions. One way to examine these disturbances is through a dual-task assessment. Many secondary cognitive tasks have been proposed as appropriate tools during concussion assessment; however, task complexity has not been compared within a dual-task investigation. The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine how gait balance control was affected by three secondary cognitive tasks of varying complexity following concussion. Forty-six adolescents completed a dual-task walking protocol which included walking without any cognitive task (WALK), walking while completing a single auditory Stroop (SAS), multiple auditory Stroop (MAS), and a question and answer task (Q&A). Those who sustained a concussion (n = 23, mean age 15.4 ± 1.3 years) reported to the laboratory within 72 h of injury and in the following time increments: 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months post-injury. Twenty-three healthy control subjects (mean age 15.4 ± 1.3 years), individually matched to each concussion subject, completed the same protocol in similar time increments. The concussion group demonstrated greater total center of mass (COM) medial/lateral displacement in the MAS and Q&A conditions compared with the control group. The concussion group also displayed the greatest peak COM anterior velocity in the least complex condition (WALK), and a significant decrease was observed as task complexity increased (SAS > MAS > Q&A). These findings indicate that gait balance control may be affected by task complexity following concussion and represent a way to identify motor recovery following concussion.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531643","annotations":[{"name":"Center of mass","weight":0.764117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.345789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.237942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.116832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Special Air Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Stroop effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Horse gait","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait"},{"name":"Component Object Model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"WALK (AM)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALK_(AM)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
