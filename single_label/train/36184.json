{"id":36184,"title":"Percutaneous device occlusion and minimally invasive surgical repair for perimembranous ventricular septal defect.","abstract":"Percutaneous device occlusion and minimally invasive surgical repair for perimembranous ventricular septal defect (pmVSD) are two typical methods to reduce the invasiveness of the conventional operation through a median sternotomy. However, few studies have compared them in terms of effectiveness and cost.Inpatients with isolated pmVSD who had undergone percutaneous device occlusion or minimally invasive surgical repair from June 2009 to June 2012 were reviewed for a comparative investigation between the two procedures.Procedure success was achieved in 80 percutaneous (93.0%) and in 113 surgical (98.3%) procedures (p=0.076). Percutaneous patients were older, with a smaller VSD size than surgical patients (16±11.7 vs 3.8±2.4 mm, p<0.001; 4.0±1.2 vs 4.3±1.3 mm, p=0.034, respectively). Major complications occurred in 1 percutaneous (1.2%) and in 4 surgical (3.5%) procedures (p=0.602), and minor complications occurred in 27 percutaneous (33.3%) and in 37 surgical (32.2%) procedures (p=0.991). The surgical repair cost 31% less than the device occlusion (¥20,565±¥3,497 vs ¥29,795±¥2,643, p<0.001), where most of the cost was attributed to the occluder in the amount of ¥19,500.Compared with device occlusion, minimally invasive surgical repair can provide comparable efficacy and complication rates. In addition, it is 31% cheaper than device occlusion. In low-income countries where health care resources are limited, medical resources must be judiciously allocated to the treatment that allows for effective treatment of the largest number of patients.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594210","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.364312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.358134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.284007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.229839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.163889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0940385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"1611","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1611"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"602","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/602"},{"name":"643","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/643"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"The Avengers (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(The_O.C.)"}]}
