{"id":81960,"title":"Prognostic significance of amino-acid transporter expression (LAT1, ASCT2, and xCT) in surgically resected tongue cancer.","abstract":"Amino-acid transporters are necessary for the tumour cell growth and survival, and have a crucial role in the development and invasiveness of cancer cells. But, it remains unclear about the prognostic significance of L-type amino-acid transporter 1 (LAT1), system ASC amino-acid transporter-2 (ASCT2), and xCT expression in patients with tongue cancer. We conducted the clinicopathological study to investigate the protein expression of these amino-acid transporters in tongue cancer.Eighty-five patients with surgically resected tongue cancer were evaluated. Tumour sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for LAT1, ASCT2, xCT, 4F2hc/CD98hc (4F2hc), Ki-67, and microvessel density (MVD) determined by CD34, and p53.L-type amino-acid transporter 1 and 4F2hc were highly expressed in 61% (52 out of 85) and 45% (38 out of 47), respectively. ASC amino-acid transporter-2 and xCT were positively expressed in 59% (50 out of 85) and 21% (18 out of 85), respectively. The expression of both LAT1 and ASCT2 was significantly associated with disease staging, lymph-node metastasis, lymphatic permeation, 4F2hc expression and cell proliferation (Ki-67). xCT expression indicated a significant association with advanced stage and tumour factor. By univariate analysis, disease staging, lymphatic permeation, vascular invasion, LAT1, ASCT2, 4F2hc, and Ki-67 had a significant relationship with overall survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that LAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting poor prognosis.L-type amino-acid transporter 1 and ASCT2 can serve as a significant prognostic factor for predicting worse outcome after surgical treatment and may have an important role in the development and aggressiveness of tongue cancer.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762957","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.849748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.712527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.681839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.668418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.268517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.259322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.247191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.194581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.124674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Honorary degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_degree"},{"name":"Permeation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeation"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"}]}
