{"id":56520,"title":"Polymorphism in the 11q24.1 genomic region is associated with myopia: a comprehensive genetic study in Chinese and Japanese populations.","abstract":"To evaluate the association of polymorphisms in the 11q24.1 genomic region and the CTNND2 gene with myopia.We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis included 6,954 cases and 9,346 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using Carlin's method. Publication bias was assessed using Egger et al.'s approach. Sensitivity, heterogeneity, and trim and fill analyses were also conducted.For the 11q24.1 genomic region, the rs11218544 polymorphism showed significant association with myopia [OR and 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.167 (1.032-1.319), p=0.013], while rs577948 showed no association with the disease [OR and 95%CI: 0.988 (0.727-1.342), p=0.936]. For the CTNND2 gene, neither rs6885224 nor rs12716080 was significantly associated with myopia {rs6885224: [OR and 95%CI: 1.051 (0.795-1.391), p=0.725], rs12716080: [OR and 95%CI: 1.173 (0.990-1.390), p=0.065]}.Our study indicated that the 11q24.1 genomic region, and particularly the rs11218544 polymorphism, has a genetic association with the development of myopia.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672220","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.851375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.772419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.556754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.396625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.328474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Japanese people","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"954","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/954"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/988"},{"name":"346","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/346"},{"name":"342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/342"},{"name":"319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/319"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Egger (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egger_(band)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
