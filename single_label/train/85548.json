{"id":85548,"title":"Multidisciplinary meetings as an effective clinical intervention.","abstract":"When used well, multidisciplinary meetings can function in the same way as other clinical interventions to improve communication, efficiency and outcomes. They help break down barriers, manage difficult emotions, and benefit service users and staff. But it is imperative that they are well prepared, well attended, and that the purpose and agenda are agreed. It is also vital to have an efficient chair and that meetings take place in an environment where feelings can be shared openly and respected. Services should recognise and address relevant training and support requirements.
