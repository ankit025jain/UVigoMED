{"id":66056,"title":"Phosphotriesterase-related protein sensed albuminuria and conferred renal tubular cell activation in membranous nephropathy.","abstract":"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome that may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The formation of MN involves the in situ formation of subepithelial immune deposits and leads to albuminuria; however, the underlying mechanism of how MN leads to ESRD remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and biological functions of phosphotriesterase-related protein (PTER) in MN.In the progression of MN, the expression of PTER increased significantly and was mainly expressed in the renal tubular cells. Both mRNA and protein expression levels of PTER were increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in the in vitro albuminuria tubular cell model. Silencing the expression of PTER by RNA interference diminished albuminuria-induced inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines production.Our findings reveal that PTER may sense albuminuria in the progression of MN, induce tubular cell activation and lead to ESRD.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750591","annotations":[{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.718403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.650433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.63229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.620071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.5738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.564819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.258593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.183419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0860629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Membranous glomerulonephritis","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membranous_glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Sediment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
