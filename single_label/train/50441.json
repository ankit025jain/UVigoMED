{"id":50441,"title":"Differences in the perceptions of self-care, health education barriers and educational needs between diabetes patients and nurses.","abstract":"This study examined the differing perceptions of diabetic patients and their nurses regarding the completion of self-care activities, barriers to participation in diabetes health education, and diabetic patients' educational needs to promote better health care for patients with diabetes in Taiwan. This study employed a cross-sectional survey. The data were collected during 2009. Questionnaires were developed to collect data on a convenience sample of 312 patients with type 2 diabetes and 202 nurses recruited from diabetes clinics in Taiwan. Perceptions of self-care behavior were statistically significantly different between patients and nurses (t = -5.05, P < 0.000). The patients perceived themselves to be more successful at completing self-care tasks whereas nurses perceived patients to be less successful at completing self-care tasks. Nurses perceived patients to experience greater difficulties in diabetes health education (t = 18.36, P < 0.000). Nurses perceived there to be a greater need for health education as compared with patients (t = 9.03, P < 0.000).","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24787252","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.724413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.652305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.559575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.439682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.403266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.318129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.29807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
