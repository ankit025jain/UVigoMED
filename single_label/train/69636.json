{"id":69636,"title":"Attachment style and perceived social support as predictors of biopsychosocial adjustment to cancer.","abstract":"Social support is associated with a decrease in psychological symptoms and a better quality of life in cancer patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of attachment dimensions on social and psychological adjustment to cancer and to explore the social and psychological adjustments, and medical adherence, among patients.The study was conducted with 68 cancer patients, between 18 and 74 years of age. The measures taken were the Demographic Information Form, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R), and Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS-SR).The results showed that an avoidant attachment style was related to difficulties in social relationships and an increase in psychological distress following cancer diagnosis. People who perceive more social support orient to health care more easily than people who perceive less social availability. It was shown that a higher level of perceived social support has a positive impact in adjustment to family relationships and leads to experiencing less psychological distress than in people who perceived less social support.Considering the complicated nature of cancer, a multi-perspective approach should be applied during the treatment process, and it is important to determine the psychosocial factors, and the causal pathways by which they lead to a better adjustment, in developing effective interventions.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558554","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.737578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biopsychosocial model","weight":0.639226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.608696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.551527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.480451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Experience","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience"},{"name":"Attachment in adults","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Orient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"People","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People"},{"name":"Cousin","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin"},{"name":"Health effects from noise","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise"}]}
