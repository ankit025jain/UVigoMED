{"id":12112,"title":"[The antiamnestic effect of nootropic substances in rats].","abstract":"It has been established in experiments in rats that some nootropic substances (oxyracetam, aniracetam, nooglutil, mexidol, new 3-hydroxypyridine derivative SK-170, piracetam and noopept) produce marked antiamnestic effect on various models of amnesia (induced by microwave irradiation, acute hypoxia, and motion sickness). At the same time, meclophenoxate exhibited antiamnestic effect in the first and second models of amnesia, while 9-aminoacridine derivative HTOS-404 was only effective in the model of amnesia caused by microwave irradiation. The antiamnestic effect of nooglutil and SK-170 was caused to a significant degree by activation of non-NMDA receptors of excitatory amino acids (generally AMPA receptors), while the effect of mexidol was related to GABA(A) receptors.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555225","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Motion sickness","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Nootropic","weight":0.651355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Amnesia","weight":0.535634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia"},{"name":"Piracetam","weight":0.533107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.380612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"AMPA receptor","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA_receptor"},{"name":"AMPA","weight":0.324311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA"},{"name":"Microwave","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"},{"name":"Excitatory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.220444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Aniracetam","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniracetam"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Microwave chemistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_chemistry"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
