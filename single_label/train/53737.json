{"id":53737,"title":"Diabetes-related heart failure.","abstract":"As the link between heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) becomes unignorable, so the need is further increasing for pathological comprehension: What is \"diabetic cardiomyopathy (DMC)?\" In response to current concern, the most updated guidelines stated by the ACCF/AHA and by the ESC/EASD take one step further, including the definition of DMC, although it is a matter yet to be completed. For more than 40 years, coronary artery disease and hypertension have been considered as the main causes of diabetes-related cardiac dysfunction. HF was originally considered as a result of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HF-REF); however, it has been recognized that HF symptoms are often observed in patients with preserved EF (HF-PEF). DMC includes HF with both reduced and preserved entities independent of coronary stenosis and hypertension. Cardiologists are thus facing a sort of chaos without clear guidelines for the \"deadly intersection\" of DM and HF. Today, the increasing interest and concern have caused DMC to be revisited and the first step in controlling the chaos around DMC is to organize and analyze all of the available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies. This review aims to illustrate the current concepts of DMC by shedding light on the new molecular mechanisms.??(Circ J?2014; 78: 576-583).
