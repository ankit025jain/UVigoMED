{"id":83963,"title":"Orange juice intake reduces patient discomfort and is effective for bowel cleansing with polyethylene glycol during bowel preparation.","abstract":"Many patients report discomfort because of the unpleasant taste of bowel preparation solutions.This study aimed to determine whether adding orange juice to 2 L of polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid is effective for reducing patient discomfort and improving palatability during bowel preparation.This was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.The study was conducted at a tertiary referral hospital and a generalized hospital.Consecutive outpatients and inpatients were randomly allocated to drink 2 L of polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid or 2 L of polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid with orange juice in a single dose or a split dose.Tolerability, palatability score, willingness, and related adverse events were investigated by questionnaires. Bowel cleansing was rated using the Aronchick scale. Each score was graded on a 5-point scale.A total of 107 patients, 53 in the orange juice group and 54 in the polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid group who underwent elective colonoscopy were enrolled. The palatability score (mean ± SD) was higher in the orange juice group than in the control group (2.36 ± 0.76 vs 1.78 ± 0.88; p = 0.005). Nausea was less frequent in the orange juice group (26.4% vs 59.3%; p = 0.001). Total amount of bowel preparation ingested was not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.44). The bowel preparation score (mean ± SD) was not significantly different (1.49 ± 0.80 vs 1.43 ± 0.77; p = 0.94). Willingness to repeat the same process was higher in the orange juice group (90.4% vs 66.7%; p = 0.003).This study is limited because only ambulatory patients were enrolled.Orange juice intake before drinking 2 L of polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid for colonoscopy can reduce patient discomfort, resulting in improved acceptability and patient compliance. This method is as effective for bowel cleansing as polyethylene glycol.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25203380","annotations":[{"name":"Ascorbic acid","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.857718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.73407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Orange juice","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_juice"},{"name":"Juice","weight":0.694254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.636206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Orange (fruit)","weight":0.496787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.455937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.435029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Colon cleansing","weight":0.340191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_cleansing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.241231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.194684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Scale (map)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Palatability","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatability"}]}
