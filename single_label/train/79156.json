{"id":79156,"title":"[Refractory chronic rhinosinusitis and bacterial biofilm].","abstract":"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease in otolaryngology, and with the development of the therapy technology, most of the cases have reached a cure. But there are still some intractable cases in clinic, signs and symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis of which still persist after the standardized drugs and technically adequate endoscopic sinus surgery, and this part is clinically named refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (RCRS). In recent studies of the pathogenesis of RCRS, bacterial biofilm (BBF) is attracting more attention. The main emphasis of this review will be to highlight the biological characteristics of BBF, the relationship of BBF and CRS and treatment strategies of BBF positive CRS.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479368","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.809561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.80691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.687199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0565641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
