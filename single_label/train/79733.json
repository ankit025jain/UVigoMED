{"id":79733,"title":"Coinfection. Helminth infection reactivates latent ?-herpesvirus via cytokine competition at a viral promoter.","abstract":"Mammals are coinfected by multiple pathogens that interact through unknown mechanisms. We found that helminth infection, characterized by the induction of the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and the activation of the transcription factor Stat6, reactivated murine ?-herpesvirus infection in vivo. IL-4 promoted viral replication and blocked the antiviral effects of interferon-? (IFN?) by inducing Stat6 binding to the promoter for an important viral transcriptional transactivator. IL-4 also reactivated human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus from latency in cultured cells. Exogenous IL-4 plus blockade of IFN? reactivated latent murine ?-herpesvirus infection in vivo, suggesting a \"two-signal\" model for viral reactivation. Thus, chronic herpesvirus infection, a component of the mammalian virome, is regulated by the counterpoised actions of multiple cytokines on viral promoters that have evolved to sense host immune status.
