{"id":30006,"title":"[Epidemiological news in cannabis].","abstract":"Cannabis is by far the most common illicit drug in France. Among 15-64 years, 32.1% have already experienced it and 8.4% declare they have used it at least once during the past twelve months. In Europe, France is one of the countries with the highest prevalence. Males are markedly more often cannabis users than females and this gender gap tends to increase with the level of use. During the last two decades, the part of the population having tried cannabis did not stop increasing, under the influence of a generalization of the cannabis experience among young people. However, cannabis last year prevalence is rather stable since 2000. Cannabis lifetime use is very rare at the beginning of middle school (1.5% in sixth grade at age 11) but increases in the following years (11% of the pupils of the eighth grade, 24% of the pupils of the ninth grade). Cannabis use at a younger age is related to subsequent onset of cannabis related problems. Adolescent and young adults from high socioeconomic status (SES) more often try cannabis than young people from lower SES. However, cannabis regular use is associated with bad school results, truancy and early school leaving, and with a lower SES. Young people from high SES indeed dispose of greater sociocultural resources to master and regulate their consumption and are more often conscious of their interest not to be tipped over in problematic use.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579342","annotations":[{"name":"France","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.68236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.551808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.502939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"School","weight":0.382994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.375548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.336941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.304301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Ninth grade","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_grade"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.104145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Eighth grade","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_grade"},{"name":"News","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Master's degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree"},{"name":"Truancy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truancy"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1564","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1564"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Life estate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_estate"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Early Buddhist schools","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Buddhist_schools"},{"name":"Sixth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_grade"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Cannabis smoking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_smoking"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Generalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Sociocultural evolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"}]}
