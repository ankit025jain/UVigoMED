{"id":92185,"title":"Systemic oxygen delivery by peritoneal perfusion of oxygen microbubbles.","abstract":"Severe hypoxemia refractory to pulmonary mechanical ventilation remains life-threatening in critically ill patients. Peritoneal ventilation has long been desired for extrapulmonary oxygenation owing to easy access of the peritoneal cavity for catheterization and the relative safety compared to an extracorporeal circuit. Unfortunately, prior attempts involving direct oxygen ventilation or aqueous perfusates of fluorocarbons or hemoglobin carriers have failed, leading many researchers to abandon the method. We attribute these prior failures to limited mass transfer of oxygen to the peritoneum and have designed an oxygen formulation that overcomes this limitation. Using phospholipid-coated oxygen microbubbles (OMBs), we demonstrate 100% survival for rats experiencing acute lung trauma to at least 2 h. In contrast, all untreated rats and rats treated with peritoneal oxygenated saline died within 30 min. For rats treated with OMBs, hemoglobin saturation and heart rate were at normal levels over the 2-h timeframe. Peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs was therefore shown to be safe and effective, and the method requires less equipment and technical expertise than initiating and maintaining an extracorporeal circuit. Further translation of peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs may provide therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome arising from trauma, sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, burns and other pulmonary diseases.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439406","annotations":[{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.78612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.748461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.743255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Peritoneal cavity","weight":0.619889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_cavity"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.614481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.608539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Infant respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.566066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.227283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.0860629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Fluorocarbon","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorocarbon"}]}
