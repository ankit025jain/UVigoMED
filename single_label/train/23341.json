{"id":23341,"title":"Macro vs micro level surgical quality improvement: a regional collaborative demonstrates the case for a national NSQIP initiative.","abstract":"The Florida Surgical Care Initiative (FSCI) is a quality improvement collaborative of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and the Florida Hospital Association. In the wake of a dramatic decrease in complications and cost documented over 15 months, we analyzed the semiannual measures reports (SAR) to determine whether this improvement was driven by specific institutions or was a global accomplishment by all participants.Reports from NSQIP were analyzed to determine rank change of participants. Odds ratio (OR) of observed-to-expected incidence of the 4 FSCI outcomes (catheter-associated urinary tract infection [CAUTI], surgical site infection [SSI], colorectal, and surgery in patients older than 65 years) were used to assess individual and group performance. Data from SAR 2 (October 2011 to April 2012) were compared with data from SAR 3 (May to July 2012). Poorly performing hospitals were tracked to determine evidence of improvement. Individual facility performance was evaluated by determining proportion of hospitals showing improved rank across all measures.Fifty-four hospitals were evaluated. SAR 2 reported 28,112 general and vascular surgical cases; SAR 3 added 10,784 more. The proportion of institutions with OR < 1 for each measure did not change significantly. Only urinary tract infection and colorectal measures demonstrated increased number of hospitals with OR < 1. Each institution that was a significant negative outlier in SAR 2 demonstrated improvement. Three of 54 hospitals demonstrated improvement across all 4 measures. Of 15 hospitals with improved performance across 3 measures, all included elderly surgery.The increase in quality achieved across this population of surgical patients was the result of a quality assessment process driven by NSQIP rather than disproportionate improvement of some raising the bar for all. The NSQIP process, applied collaboratively across a population by committed institutions, produces dramatic results.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
