{"id":92284,"title":"Radiologic assessment and frequency of idiopathic osteosclerosis of jawbones: an interpopulation comparison.","abstract":"Idiopathic osteosclerosis is a localized growth of compact bone with an unknown cause. This asymptomatic lesion is an insignificant finding and as such requires no treatment. It should be distinguished from other types of osteosclerosis created by inflammatory processes and systemic diseases.To determine the prevalence and distribution of idiopathic osteosclerosis in the jawbones in Iran and to compare this prevalence and distribution with other populations.This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed in the Dental School of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, between 2010 and 2011. Data were collected from the files of patients who underwent panoramic radiography for dental treatment. Location, shape, and relation between idiopathic osteosclerosis and the tooth as well as the resorption of the tooth involved were evaluated. Lesion distribution regarding age, gender, localization, shape, dental relationship, and root resorption was assessed using the chi-squared test.In total, 787 panoramic radiographs of 456 women and 331 men were assessed. Idiopathic osteosclerosis was detected in 75 (9.5%) patients. The prevalence of idiopathic osteosclerosis was significantly higher in the women (11.8% vs. 6.3%; P < 0.01). The mean age of the patients with idiopathic osteosclerosis was 31.9 ± 17.9 years and 30.8 ± 13.3 years in the patients without idiopathic osteosclerosis. The distribution of idiopathic osteosclerosis in the mandible (97.3%), mostly in the premolar region, was significantly higher than that in the maxilla (2.7%).Our results showed high frequencies of idiopathic osteosclerosis in Iran in comparison to some other countries.","date":"2014-11-15","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316662","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.760887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.760126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.73612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.678936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.619196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.526824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Root resorption","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_resorption"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Tehran","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran"},{"name":"Osteosclerosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosclerosis"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Panorama","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panorama"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"}]}
