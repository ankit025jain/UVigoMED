{"id":30816,"title":"Risky alcohol use among migrant women in entertainment venues in China.","abstract":"The aims of this study are to describe the prevalence of hazardous drinking among migrant women working in entertainment venues in an urban setting in China and to identify specific risk factors and locations where hazardous drinking occurs.From March to July 2012, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 358 young migrant women working in entertainment venues in the capital city of Hefei, Anhui Province, China. Participants were asked about information regarding their demographic characteristics, sexual behavior, mental health, alcohol use and drug use.Overall, 203 (57%) participants had an AUDIT score ?8 (risky drinking) and 95 (27%) women had an AUDIT ?16 (probable dependence). Greater likelihood of probable alcohol dependence was associated with being younger (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.95), working at an affluent venue (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.13-5.36) and depressive symptoms during the past week (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.10-6.83).Our study documents risky drinking practices among female migrants, irrespective of whether or not women reported engaging in commercial sex, working in entertainment venues. Our data suggest that entertainment venues, particularly those that are higher end (i.e. affluent) venues, should be targeted for public health interventions aimed to reduce harmful drinking practices.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452724","annotations":[{"name":"Recreational drug
