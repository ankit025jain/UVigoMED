{"id":68300,"title":"Renal and vascular protective effects of ezetimibe in chronic kidney disease.","abstract":"Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for not only cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but also chronic kidney disease (CKD). Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, lowers cholesterol levels by inhibiting both extrinsic and intrinsic cholesterol absorption via the gastrointestinal duct. However, very few studies have examined its efficacy and safety for patients with dyslipidemia complicated with CKD.Thirty-seven dyslipidemic patients (low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ?120 mg/dL) complicated with CKD were given ezetimibe (10 mg/day) for twenty-four weeks. The efficacy and safety of the therapy, including the anti-atherosclerotic and renal protective effects, were then examined.Significant decreases were observed in the levels of LDL-C (158.9 ± 26.9 mg/dL?123.0 ± 31.8 mg/dL; p<0.0001), remnant-like lipoprotein cholesterol (9.3 ± 5.3 mg/dL?7.3 ± 3.8 mg/dL; p<0.05) and lipoprotein (a) (22.0 ± 16.1 mg/dL?16.4 ± 11.0 mg/dL; p<0.01). The estimated glomerular filtration rate did not change, but the urine protein to creatinine ratio decreased significantly (1,107.3 ± 1,454.2 mg/gCre?732.1 ± 1,237.8 mg/gCre; p<0.05). No changes were observed in the carotid intima media thickness, but the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity decreased significantly (1,770.4 ± 590.3 cm/sec?1,702.5 ± 519.9 cm/sec; p<0.05). No adverse events were observed.Ezetimibe can be safely administered even to patients with CKD. The results of this study indicate that ezetimibe may provide some renal protection and suppress the complications of CVD in CKD patients.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531086","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.853728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.726288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.625688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.518321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ezetimibe","weight":0.422041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezetimibe"},{"name":"Tunica intima","weight":0.313465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunica_intima"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.0463236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}]}
