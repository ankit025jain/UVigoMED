{"id":86747,"title":"Aprepitant in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer receiving carboplatin-based chemotherapy.","abstract":"Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is an unanswered problem in cancer therapy. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of triple antiemetic therapy with aprepitant, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received carboplatin-based first-line chemotherapy.Chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this randomized phase-II study. Patients were randomized to standard antiemetic therapy with a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist and dexamethasone, and aprepitant add-on triple antiemetic therapy. The primary endpoint was the complete response rate (no vomiting and no rescue therapy) during the 120 h post-chemotherapy.A total of 134 patients were assigned randomly to the aprepitant group or the control group. The aprepitant group and the control group showed an overall complete response rate of 80.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 69.2-88.1%) and 67.2% (95% CI, 55.3-77.2%; odds ratio (OR), 0.50; 95% CI, 0.22-1.10; p = 0.085), respectively. Among patients taking carboplatin and pemetrexed, adding aprepitant significantly improved the complete response rate in the overall phase (83.8% in the aprepitant group and 56.8% in the control group; OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.70; p < 0.01) and the delayed phase (86.5% in the aprepitant group and 59.1% in the control group; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.65; p < 0.01).Carboplatin-based chemotherapy has considerable emetic potential. Triple antiemetic therapy with aprepitant, a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone improved the control of CINV prevention in patients receiving carboplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746177","annotations":[{"name":"Carboplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboplatin"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Pemetrexed","weight":0.89756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemetrexed"},{"name":"Antiemetic","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiemetic"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Aprepitant","weight":0.83303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprepitant"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.746739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.650183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.549784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.319932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.275698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"5-HT3 receptor","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT3_receptor"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"}]}
