{"id":91612,"title":"The effects of using a human patient simulator compared to a CD-ROM in teaching critical thinking and performance.","abstract":"Military healthcare personnel, including nurse anesthetists, must have the knowledge and skills to care for the extensive, severe injuries incurred on the battlefield. No studies have compared the 2 teaching strategies of using the human patient simulator (HPS) and a CD-ROM in caring for combat injuries relative to critical thinking and performance using nurse anesthesia participants.A prospective, pretest-posttest experimental, mixed design (within and between) was used to determine if there were statistically significant differences in HPS and CD-ROM educational strategies relative to caring for patients who have trauma. Two instruments were used: critical thinking, which consisted of multiple-choice questions; and a combat performance instrument that measured ability to care for patients.A repeated analysis of variance and a least significant difference post-hoc test were used to analyze the data. The HPS group performed better than the CD-ROM and control groups relative to performance (P=.000) but not on critical thinking (P=.239). There was no difference between the CD-ROM and control group (P=.171) on the combat performance instrument.In this study, the HPS method of instruction was a more effective method of teaching than the CD-ROM approach.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488874","annotations":[{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.606453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.485089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.43922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.437547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Critical thinking","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking"},{"name":"CD-ROM","weight":0.13054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Virtual patient","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_patient"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"239","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/239"},{"name":"Helsingin Palloseura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingin_Palloseura"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Nurse anesthetist","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_anesthetist"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"}]}
