{"id":70350,"title":"Direct involvement of CD56 in cytokine-induced killer-mediated lysis of CD56+ hematopoietic target cells.","abstract":"Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are in-vitro-expanded T lymphocytes that represent a heterogeneous population. A large majority of CIK cells are CD3(+)CD56(+), and this population has been shown to confer a cytotoxic effect against tumor targets. The scope of this work was to study whether CD56 has a direct role in CIK-mediated cytotoxicity. Blocking of CD56 with the anti-CD56 monoclonal antibody GPR165 significantly reduced CIK-mediated lysis of three CD56(+) hematopoietic tumor cell lines (AML-NS8, NB4, and KCL22), whereas no effect was observed on three CD56(-) hematopoietic tumor cell lines (K562, REH, and MOLT-4). Knockdown of CD56 in CIK cells by short interfering RNA made the cells less cytotoxic against a CD56(+) target, and knockdown of CD56 in target cells with lentiviral short hairpin RNA significantly altered their susceptibility to CIK-mediated lysis. Our data suggest that homophilic interaction between CD56 molecules may occur in tumor-cell recognition, leading to CIK-mediated cell death.
