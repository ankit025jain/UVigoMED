{"id":37527,"title":"Late hypertension in patients with repaired aortic coarctation.","abstract":"Coarctation of the aorta represents more than a simple obstructive lesion, as there is often evidence of hypertension and vascular dysfunction despite successful surgery at an early age. There are ample data showing that a large proportion of patients develop arterial hypertension, and this appears to increase with age. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of late hypertension is incomplete, and there is limited information on which drugs are most appropriate. Increased arterial rigidity is now well described in this patient group, although it is not known how this should influence therapy. The increase in afterload associated with this increased rigidity has been found to have an impact on the left ventricle at an early stage, and the interaction between the vascular dysfunction and the ventricle is an area of interest and active research. This article reviews some recent studies and highlights areas where research questions remain.
