{"id":54512,"title":"Plasma miR-126 is a potential biomarker for early prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus in susceptible individuals.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major public health problem in China. Diagnostic markers are urgently needed to identify individuals at risk of developing T2DM and encourage them to adapt to a healthier life style. Circulating miRNAs present important sources of noninvasive biomarkers of various diseases. Recently, a novel plasma microRNA signature was identified in T2DM. Here, we evaluated the T2DM-related miRNA signature in plasma of three study groups: normal (fasting glucose (FG), 4.8-5.2 mmol/L), T2DM-susceptible (FG, 6.1-6.9 mmol/L), and T2DM individuals (FG, ? 7.0 mmol/L) and tested the feasibility of using circulating miRNAs to identify individuals at risk of developing T2DM. Among the 5 miRNAs included in the signature, miR-29b and miR-28-3p are not detectable. miR-15a and miR-223 have comparable expression levels among three groups. Notably, miR-126 is the only miRNA that showed significantly reduced expression in susceptible individuals and T2DM patients compared to normal individuals, suggesting that miR-126 in circulation may serve as a potential biomarker for early identification of susceptible individuals to T2DM.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455723","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.899703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.865624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.635622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.634816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.513748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"283","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/283"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
