{"id":21574,"title":"[Risk factors and prevention of surgical site infection for colorectal surgery].","abstract":"Surgical site infection (SSI), the most frequent adverse event after colorectal surgery, leads to longer hospital days and increased healthcare costs. The development of SSI depends on a complex interplay between patient-related and procedure-related factors. This review refers to the several risk factors for the development of SSI and the risk factor index which were indicated by National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance. Furthermore, this review will focus on the prevention of SSI and refer to colon preparation and preventive antibiotics for colorectal surgery.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597364","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.761945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.72046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.639933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
