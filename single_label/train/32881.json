{"id":32881,"title":"Three-dimensional computerized preoperative planning of total hip arthroplasty with high-riding dislocation developmental dysplasia of the hip.","abstract":"To assess whether computed tomography (CT)-based 3-dimensional (3D) computerized pre-operative planning is accurate and reliable in patients with high-riding dislocation developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA).Between September 2009 and February 2011, a prospective study with an inbuilt means of comparing predictive techniques in 20 patients (20 hips) with high-riding dislocation DDH was undertaken. All patients had pre- and post-operative CT scans, data from which were transferred digitally to Mimics software. 3D pre-operative planning to predict the acetabular component size, hip rotation center position and acetabular component coverage was performed using Mimics software. The results and post-operative course were compared with those of the traditional acetate templating technique.Using 3D computerized planning, 14/20 components (70%) were predicted exactly and 6/20 (30%) within one size, whereas with the conventional acetate templating technique, 5/20 components (25%) were predicted exactly, 9/20 (45%) within one size and 6/20 (30%) within two or more sizes. There was a strong correlation between the 3D computerized planned acetabular component size, hip rotation center distance, acetabular component host coverage and that found postoperatively. Five patients were considered to need structural bone graft on the basis of 3D computerized planning; this was highly coincident with the intraoperative findings in all five cases.CT-based 3D computerized pre-operative planning using Mimics software is an accurate and reliable technique for patients with high-riding dislocation DDH undergoing THA.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890290","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.836388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.467061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.141543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.103663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0989523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0918536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"1420","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1420"},{"name":"920","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/920"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Centre (ice hockey)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"List of gear nomenclature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gear_nomenclature"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0148463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Template processor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
