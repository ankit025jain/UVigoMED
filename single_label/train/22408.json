{"id":22408,"title":"Intravenous paracetamol as an antipyretic and analgesic medication: the significance of drug metabolism.","abstract":"One prospective, open-label, non-randomized study was conducted in 100 patients to define the antipyretic and analgesic effect of a new intravenous formulation of 1 g of paracetamol; 71 received paracetamol for the management of fever and 29 received paracetamol for pain relief after abdominal surgery or for neoplastic pain. Serial follow-up measurements of core temperature and of pain intensity were done for 6 h. Additional rescue medications were recorded for 5 days. Blood was sampled for the measurement of free paracetamol (APAP) and of glucuronide-APAP and N-sulfate-APAP by an HPLC assay. Defervescence, defined as core temperature below or equal to 37.1Â°C, was achieved in 52 patients (73.2%) within a median time of 3 h. Patients failing to become afebrile with the first dose of paracetamol became afebrile when administered other agents as rescue medications. Analgesia was achieved in 25 patients (86.4%) within a median time of 2 h. Serum levels of glucuronide-APAP were greater among non-responders to paracetamol. The presented results suggest that the intravenous formulation of paracetamol is clinically effective depending on drug metabolism.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553403","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.902106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Antipyretic","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.813417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.65588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.618664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.515421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.498588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Normal human body temperature","weight":0.217934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_human_body_temperature"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.21542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
