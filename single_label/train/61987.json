{"id":61987,"title":"Clinicopathologic and survival characteristics of childhood and adolescent non Hodgkin's lymphoma in Yazd, Iran.","abstract":"Data regarding childhood and adolescent non Hodgkin lymphomas in Iran are limited. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological and histomorphological features and survival of affected patients in our center.The clinicopathologic features and outcome of 44 children and adolescents with non Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed during 2004-2012, were investigated retrospectively. The influence of potential prognostic parameters in overall survival was investigated by log-rank test and Cox regression analysis.The mean age at presentation was 13.8 Â± 6.16 years with a male predilection (M: F=3:1). Malignant lymphoma, not otherwise specified, diffuse large cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma were the three most common histological types observed. The tumors were 36.4% intermediate grade, 27.3% high grade and 34.1% belonged to the malignant lymphoma not otherwise specified group. Immunohistochemistry findings were available in 39 cases. Out of these cases 33 (84.6%) had B cell lineage, 4 (10.25%) T cell lineage and 2 (5.12%) of the cases belonged to miscellaneous group. 3 year and 5 year survivals were 48% and 30% respectively and median survival was 36 months (95%CI=21.7-50.3 months). Overall survival in patients with high grade tumors was 19.5 months, in the intermediate group,79 months , and for malignant lymphomas not otherwise specified it was 33.6 months (p value=0.000).The survival rate for children and adolescents with non Hodgkin lymphomas at our center during 2004-2012 was at a low level.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641372","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Burkitt's lymphoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkitt's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.814555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.653222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.356338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Yazd","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazd"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Center (basketball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Francis Crawford Burkitt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crawford_Burkitt"},{"name":"Large-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Hodgkins, Illinois","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkins,_Illinois"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Large cell","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cell"},{"name":"Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_Intermediate_Hurling_Championship"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
