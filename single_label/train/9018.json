{"id":9018,"title":"Supplementing exposure to hypoxia with a copper depleted diet does not exacerbate right ventricular remodeling in mice.","abstract":"Pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right ventricular (RV) failure are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Prognosis is determined by occurrence of RV failure. Currently, adequate treatment for RV failure is lacking. Further research into the molecular basis for the development of RV failure as well as the development of better murine models of RV failure are therefore imperative. We hypothesize that adding a low-copper diet to chronic hypoxia in mice reinforces their individual effect and that the combination of mild pulmonary vascular remodeling and capillary rarefaction, induces RV failure.Six week old mice were subjected to normoxia (N; 21% O2) or hypoxia (H; 10% O2) during a period of 8 weeks and received either a normal diet (Cu+) or a copper depleted diet (Cu-). Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and MRI analysis.Here, we characterized a mouse model of chronic hypoxia combined with a copper depleted diet and demonstrate that eight weeks of chronic hypoxia (10%) is sufficient to induce RV hypertrophy and subsequent RV failure. Addition of a low copper diet to hypoxia did not have any further deleterious effects on right ventricular remodeling.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736644","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.652211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.645269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.618664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.61839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.577162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.561506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.384756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.364512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.334077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.246474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.114562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Rarefaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rarefaction"},{"name":"Ventricular remodeling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_remodeling"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
