{"id":51460,"title":"Evaluation of thyroid cancer in Chinese females with breast cancer by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), microvessel density, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).","abstract":"To evaluate thyroid cancer in Chinese females with breast cancer by VEGF, MVD, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), 34 of 2,278 female inpatients with breast diseases who underwent routine thyroid ultrasonography were pathologically proved as thyroid cancer and enrolled into two groups: a breast cancer group and a non-breast cancer group. CEUS was performed and enhancement patterns were classified. Time-intensity curve parameters were analyzed to correlate with MVD CD34 and VEGF expression. Fourteen (2.6 %) and 20 (1.1 %) patients in breast cancer and non-breast cancer group were pathologically diagnosed as thyroid cancer. Six (42.8 %) and 0(0 %) patients showed high enhancement CEUS patterns of thyroid cancer in these two groups, respectively. The arrival time of time-intense curve was shorter, and the mean and peak intensity were higher in thyroid cancer in breast cancer group. The mean MVD counts and VEGF expression were significantly higher in thyroid and breast carcinomas in breast cancer group (P < 0.01). We also found that the mean and peak intensity were significantly associated with MVD counts and VEGF expression (P < 0.01). CEUS is recommended in evaluating the microcirculation of thyroid cancer in women with breast cancer and has the significant relationship with MVD counts and VEGF expression.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687553","annotations":[{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.579218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.456178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Breast disease","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_disease"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
