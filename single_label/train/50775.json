{"id":50775,"title":"Vintafolide: a novel targeted agent for epithelial ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Vintafolide (EC145) is a novel folate-conjugated vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide; DAVBLH) that binds with high affinity to the folate receptor (FR), expressed in a majority of epithelial ovarian cancers. In preclinical studies, vintafolide had significant antiproliferative activity and tolerability. Phase I studies demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with constipation being the dose-limiting toxicity. A Phase II study of vintafolide plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) versus PLD alone in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival with combination therapy. (99m)Tc-etarfolatide, a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, determines FR status, which allows determination of those patients most likely to benefit from treatment with vintafolide. A Phase III study evaluating vintafolide plus PLD versus PLD alone in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is currently underway.
