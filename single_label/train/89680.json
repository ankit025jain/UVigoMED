{"id":89680,"title":"A prospective, randomised trial comparing the use of absorbable and metallic screws in the fixation of distal tibiofibular syndesmosis injuries: mid-term follow-up.","abstract":"Our aim was to compare polylevolactic acid screws with titanium screws when used for fixation of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis at mid-term follow-up. A total of 168 patients, with a mean age of 38.5 years (18 to 72) who were randomly allocated to receive either polylevolactic acid (n = 86) or metallic (n = 82) screws were included. The Baird scoring system was used to assess the overall satisfaction and functional recovery post-operatively. The demographic details and characteristics of the injury were similar in the two groups. The mean follow-up was 55.8 months (48 to 66). The Baird scores were similar in the two groups at the final follow-up. Patients in the polylevolactic acid group had a greater mean dorsiflexion (p = 0.011) and plantar-flexion of the injured ankles (p < 0.001). In the same group, 18 patients had a mild and eight patients had a moderate foreign body reaction. In the metallic groups eight had mild and none had a moderate foreign body reaction (p < 0.001). In total, three patients in the polylevolactic acid group and none in the metallic group had heterotopic ossification (p = 0.246). We conclude that both screws provide adequate fixation and functional recovery, but polylevolactic acid screws are associated with a higher incidence of foreign body reactions.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692626","annotations":[{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.186179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.110465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0324486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Dorsiflexion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsiflexion"},{"name":"Syndesmosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndesmosis"},{"name":"Heterotopic ossification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotopic_ossification"},{"name":"Plantarflexion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantarflexion"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Spencer Fullerton Baird","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Fullerton_Baird"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Foreign body granuloma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body_granuloma"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
