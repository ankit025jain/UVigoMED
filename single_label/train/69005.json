{"id":69005,"title":"PPAR? and NAD(P)H oxidase system interaction in glycerol-induced acute renal failure: role of gp91phox subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase.","abstract":"Increased NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent free radical generation has been proposed to be a mechanism in glycerol-induced acute renal failure (ARF). Previously, we showed a PPAR?-mediated regulation of free radical generation in ARF. In this study, we examined NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent pathology in ARF and its connection with PPAR? using both Sprague-Dawley rats and gp91phox (+/-) mice. Male gp91phox (+/-) or wild type (+/+) mice were distributed into vehicle and ARF group (50% glycerol; 8 mL/kg bw; i.m.). Animals were placed in metabolic cages for 24 hr and were sacrificed under pentobarbital anesthesia. Urine, plasma and kidneys were processed for biochemical and molecular analysis. Glycerol doubled proteinuria in (+/+) mice (68 ± 4 mg/24 hr) but not in (+/-) mice (43 ± 9 mg/24 hr). This was associated with a markedly reduced creatinine excretion in (+/+) mice (Con: 0.6 ± 0.03 & ARF: 0.37 ± 0.02). Basal plasma and urinary NO was higher in (+/-) mice than the (+/+) type while plasma 8-isoprostane level was lower in (+/-) mice (WT: 165 ± 20; KO: 100 ± 15 pg/mL). Glycerol reduced UNOXV in both (+/+) and (+/-) mice although plasma NO was unchanged. Glycerol also doubled 8-isoprostane in (+/+) (363 ± 22 pg/mL) but not in (+/-) mice (152 ± 20 pg/mL) and this was associated with an increased NAD(P)H oxidase activity in the (+/+) mice. In ARF, PPAR? expression was reduced in (+/+) mice but increased in (+/-) mice. PPAR? activity was also reduced in (+/+) mice but was unchanged in (+/-) mice. We conclude that gp91phox contributes to NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated increased free radical generation in ARF and this may be via reduced PPAR?.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479849","annotations":[{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.867149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Glycerol","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","weight":0.819633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.779985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.731065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.725667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.695962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.525533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.471864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0652597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor"},{"name":"NADPH oxidase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADPH_oxidase"},{"name":"Pentobarbital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentobarbital"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
