{"id":75845,"title":"Positivity to p-ANCA in patients with status epilepticus.","abstract":"Status epilepticus (SE) may occur in the setting of several internal or neurologic diseases. Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are a group of Ig that may be observed in patients with different autoimmune disorders but are particularly associated with systemic vasculitis named ANCA-associated-vasculities (AAV). We herein report 3 patients with SE and positivity to p-ANCA.One patient had a catastrophic evolution and died 5 months after disease onset. The other two patients had a good outcome and remained seizure-free at 30 months and 5 years of follow-up respectively.This report highlights the importance of considering ANCA dosage in patients with SE of unclear origin.","date":"2014-07-26","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25033936","annotations":[{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.740529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.314179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.290911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Status epilepticus","weight":0.190579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_epilepticus"},{"name":"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-neutrophil_cytoplasmic_antibody"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Positivism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism"},{"name":"Adeno-associated virus","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adeno-associated_virus"}]}
