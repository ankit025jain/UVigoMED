{"id":56691,"title":"Visual function and color vision in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.","abstract":"Color vision and self-reported visual function in everyday life in young adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) were investigated.Participants were 30 young adults with ADHD and 30 controls matched for age and gender. They were tested individually and completed the Visual Activities Questionnaire (VAQ), Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test (FMT) and A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT).The ADHD group reported significantly more problems in 4 of 8 areas on the VAQ: depth perception, peripheral vision, visual search and visual processing speed. Further analyses of VAQ items revealed that the ADHD group endorsed more visual problems associated with driving than controls. Color perception difficulties on the FMT were restricted to the blue spectrum in the ADHD group. FMT and AQT results revealed slower processing of visual stimuli in the ADHD group.A comprehensive investigation of mechanisms underlying visual function and color vision in adults with ADHD is warranted, along with the potential impact of these visual problems on driving performance.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646898","annotations":[{"name":"Depth perception","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Color vision","weight":0.789135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Peripheral vision","weight":0.538725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vision"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.520363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.409377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Visual processing","weight":0.40633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_processing"},{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.26641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Hue","weight":0.238989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue"},{"name":"Visual search","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_search"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.154042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Image processing","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Clock rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate"},{"name":"Disorder (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(band)"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Personal life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
