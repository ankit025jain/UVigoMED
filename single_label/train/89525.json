{"id":89525,"title":"Increased Expression of TBP/TFIID after spinal cord injury in adult rats.","abstract":"Transcription factor IID (TFIID), as a general transcription factor, plays a pivotal role in the preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly and transcription initiation by recruiting RNA polymerase II to the promoter. The TFIID complex contains the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and a group of conserved TAF proteins. However, its distribution and function in the central nervous system (CNS) are more diverse than previously understood. Here, we mainly investigated the spatiotemporal expression and cellular localization of TBP/TFIID during spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult rats. Western blot analysis revealed that TBP/TFIID was present in normal rat's spinal cord. It gradually increased, reached a peak at the third day after SCI, and then decreased. We observed that TBP/TFIID was widely distributed in spinal cord, mainly in neurons and glial cells. In addition, Western blot detection also showed that the third day post-injury was the proliferation peak indicated by the elevated expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker of proliferating cells. Importantly, injury-induced expression of TBP/TFIID was colabelled by PCNA showed the increase of TBP/TFIID expression in proliferating astrocytes and microglia. Collectively, we hypothesize that TBP/TFIID may be implicated in the proliferation of astrocytes and microglia and the recovery of neurological outcomes.
