{"id":51002,"title":"pH sensitive thiolated cationic hydrogel for oral insulin delivery.","abstract":"The objective of this work is to study the efficacy of pH sensitive thiolated Polydimethylaminoethylmethacrylate for oral delivery of insulin. Synthesis of pH sensitive thiolated Polydimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (PDCPA) was carried out by crosslinking Polymethacrylic acid with thiolated Polydimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (PDCys) via carbodiimide chemistry. Prior to in vivo experiment, various physicochemical and biological characterisation were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of PDCPA. Modification was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopy. The particle size was found to be 284 nm with a zeta potential of 37.3+/-1.58 mV. Texture analyser measurements showed that PDCPA is more mucoadhesive than the parent polymer. Transepithelial electrical measurements showed a reduction of greater than 50% on incubation with PDCPA particles. Permeation studies showed that PDCPA is more permeable than the parent polymer. On in vivo evaluation on male diabetic rats, insulin loaded PDCPA exhibited a blood glucose reduction of 19%.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734516","annotations":[{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.583202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.569549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Physical chemistry","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.467318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Permeation","weight":0.335145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeation"},{"name":"Elementary particle","weight":0.200897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle"},{"name":"Zeta potential","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_potential"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0886352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Carbodiimide","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbodiimide"},{"name":"Cationic","weight":0.0374977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cationic"},{"name":"Permeability (earth sciences)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(earth_sciences)"},{"name":"Hydrogel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogel"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Automated analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_analyser"},{"name":"Particle size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_size"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"}]}
