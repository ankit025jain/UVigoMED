{"id":9528,"title":"Paramagnetic hollow silica nanospheres for in vivo targeted ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.","abstract":"A series of hollow silica nanospheres (HSNSs) with sizes ranging from 100 to 400 nm were synthesized and used for primary ultrasound imaging (US) efficiency assessment. The 400 nm HSNSs were chosen as platform for conjugation with Gd-DTPA and cyclo-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid c(RGD) peptide to construct US and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual-modal contrast agents (CAs): [HSNSs@(DTPA-Gd)-RGD]. The obtained CAs displayed good physiological stability, low cytotoxicity and negligible hemolytic activity in vitro. Furthermore, the passive accumulation and active-targeting of the HSNSs in the tumor site of mice was demonstrated by US and MR imaging, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative biodistribution of the HSNSs showed that they mainly accumulated in the tissues of liver, lung, tumor after intravenous administration and then be excreted from feces. In addition, histological, hematological, blood and biochemical analysis were used to further study toxicity of the HSNSs, and all results indicated that there were no covert toxicity of HSNSs in mice after long exposure times. Findings from this study indicated that the silica-based paramagnetic HSNSs can be used as a platform for long-term targeted imaging and therapy studies safely in vivo.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703718","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.790758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Paramagnetism","weight":0.768396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Silicon dioxide","weight":0.752514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.715388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.62,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.534238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.419741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.357516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Biodistribution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodistribution"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0176724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Passivation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
