{"id":69323,"title":"MicroRNA-30c serves as an independent biochemical recurrence predictor and potential tumor suppressor for prostate cancer.","abstract":"MicroRNA-30c (miR-30c) acts as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter in various human malignancies. However, the involvement of miR-30c in prostate cancer (PCa) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular function and the clinical significance of miR-30c in PCa. Expression levels of miR-30c in PCa tissues and cells were detected by quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Additionally, the associations of miR-30c expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis in PCa patients were analyzed. The potential role of miR-30c in tumorigenesis of PCa cells was further evaluated by in vitro cell assays. MiR-30c was significantly down-regulated in PCa tissues and cells compared with the corresponding controls (P<0.05). In addition, the downregulation of miR-30c in PCa tissues was significantly associated with higher Gleason score (P=0.009), advanced pathological stage (P=0.016) and biochemical recurrence (P=0.034). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the reduced expression of miR-30c was correlated with shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (P=0.023). The multivariate analysis also identified miR-30c as an independent prognostic predictor for biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with PCa. Furthermore, the enforced expression of miR-30c suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells in vitro. Our data indicated the involvement of miR-30c in PCa progression and suggested its potential role as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in PCa. On cellular level, miR-30c may function as a tumor suppressor for PCa cells by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452717","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.67264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.619436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.511845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.213174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.203971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0483347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Tumor promotion","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_promotion"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"}]}
