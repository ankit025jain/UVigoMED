{"id":80175,"title":"Immunogenicity and antigenicity of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 10.","abstract":"Among the proteins involved in the invasion by merozoite, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are suggested as potential vaccine candidates because of their localization to apical organelles and the surface; these candidates are predicted to play essential roles during invasion. As a GPI-AP, Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 10 (PvMSP-10) induces high antibody titers. However, such high antibody titers have shown no protective efficacy for animals challenged with P. vivax parasites in a previous study. To adequately evaluate the immunogenicity and further characterize PvMSP-10 in order to understand its vaccine potential, we assessed its immunogenicity by immunizing BALB/c mice with cell-free expressed recombinant PvMSP-10 protein. The antigenicity of MSP-10 was analyzed, and we found 42% sensitivity and 95% specificity using serum samples from P. vivax-infected Korean patients. The IgG1 and IgG3 were the predominant immunoreactive antibodies against PvMSP-10 in vivax patient sera, and IgG1 and IgG3 and Th1-type cytokines were predominantly secreted in PvMSP-10-immunized mice. We conclude that the immunogenicity and antigenicity of MSP-10 may serve as a potential vaccine against vivax malaria.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764159","annotations":[{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.891569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Organelle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Merozoite surface protein","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merozoite_surface_protein"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.146359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Antigenicity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenicity"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
