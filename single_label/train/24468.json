{"id":24468,"title":"The Danish Microbiology Database (MiBa) 2010 to 2013.","abstract":"The Danish Microbiology Database (MiBa) is a national database that receives copies of reports from all Danish departments of clinical microbiology. The database was launched in order to provide healthcare personnel with nationwide access to microbiology reports and to enable real-time surveillance of communicable diseases and microorganisms. The establishment and management of MiBa has been a collaborative process among stakeholders, and the present paper summarises lessons learned from this nationwide endeavour which may be relevant to similar projects in the rapidly changing landscape of health informatics.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434175","annotations":[{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.69917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.48435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Medical microbiology","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_microbiology"},{"name":"Informatics (academic field)","weight":0.125572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics_(academic_field)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.108106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Stakeholder (corporate)","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Ship naming and launching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_naming_and_launching"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Landscape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape"},{"name":"Academic department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_department"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Government database","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_database"}]}
