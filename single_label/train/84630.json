{"id":84630,"title":"Updated international clinical recommendations on scar management: part 2--algorithms for scar prevention and treatment.","abstract":"In 2002, an international advisory panel was convened to assess the scientific literature and develop evidence-based guidance for the prevention and treatment of pathologic scarring. Emerging clinical data, new treatment options, and technical advances warranted a renewed literature search and review of the initial advisory panel recommendations.To update the management algorithm for pathologic scarring to reflect best practice standards at present.Management recommendations were derived from clinical evidence amassed during a comprehensive literature search and from the clinical experience and consensus opinion of advisory panel members.A combination approach using multiple modalities provides the maximum potential for successful treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. The advisory panel advocates a move toward more aggressive initial management of keloids, including earlier application of 5-fluorouracil. A growing body of clinical research supports a place in therapy for newer agents (e.g., bleomycin, onion extract, imiquimod, mitomycin C) and laser therapy (pulsed-dye, fractional) for scar management.Prevention and treatment of pathologic scarring requires individualized care built upon the principles of evidence-based medicine and continues to evolve in step with technological and scientific advances.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068544","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.565859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.504445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.473519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.329465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.174872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.164505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Bleomycin","weight":0.112303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleomycin"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Onion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion"},{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Imiquimod","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imiquimod"},{"name":"Advocate","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Keloid","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid"}]}
