{"id":54122,"title":"To assess the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose in Western Indian population.","abstract":"The objective of the study to determine the prevalence of Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Impaired Fasting Glucose (both combined termed as Pre Diabetes) in the population of Gujarat.In year 2007 and 2008, a cross sectional survey was conducted via mode of camps at various urban and rural part of Gujarat. After obtaining an informed consent, comprehensive questionnaire was used to collect the various anthropological details, physical examination and blood collection was performed from around 1700 subjects > or = 20 years of age from the different areas of Gujarat. Chi square test was used for all categorical comparisons. Also multiple logistic regression was used for detailed exploratory analysis.The crude prevalence of IFG in Gujarati population is around 2.76% and IGT is around 6.12%. But the age adjusted prevalence of IFG is around 2.72% and IGT is around 4.67%. If we extrapolate these to population of Gujarat, it indicates that around 1.3 million people are having impaired fasting glucose and around 2.3 million people have impaired glucose tolerance. The prevalence of IGT found more after age of 40 years. For IFG, there is increase after age of 40 years, but not significant statistically.High prevalence of IGT validates that there are chances of the pandemic trend in Gujarat, as eventually IGT may get converted into Diabetes in near future. These results need urgent attention to develop a public awareness programme.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Endocrine System
