{"id":2419,"title":"Outcomes after implementing a tailored endoscopic step-up approach to walled-off necrosis in acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to compare the outcomes of patients with pancreatic or peripancreatic walled-off necrosis by endoscopy using the conventional approach versus an algorithmic approach based on the collection size, location and stepwise response to intervention.This was an observational before-after study of consecutive patients managed over two time intervals. In the initial period (2004-2009) symptomatic patients with walled-off necrosis underwent conventional single transmural drainage with placement of two stents and a nasocystic catheter, followed by direct endoscopic necrosectomy, if required. In the later period (2010-2013) an algorithmic approach was adopted based on size and extent of the walled-off necrosis and stepwise response to intervention. The main outcome was treatment success, defined as a reduction in walled-off necrosis size to 2?cm or less on CT after 8?weeks.Forty-seven patients were treated in the first interval and 53 in the second. There was no difference in patient demographics, clinical or walled-off necrosis characteristics and laboratory parameters between the groups, apart from a higher proportion of women and Caucasians in the later period. The treatment success rate was higher for the algorithmic approach compared with conventional treatment (91 versus 60 per cent respectively; P?<?0·001). On multivariable logistic regression, management based on the algorithm was the only predictor of treatment success (odds ratio 6·51, 95 per cent c.i. 2·19 to 19·37; P?=?0·001).An algorithmic approach to pancreatic and peripancreatic walled-off necrosis, based on the collection size, location and stepwise response to intervention, resulted in an improved rate of treatment success compared with conventional endoscopic management.","date":"2014-11-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333872","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.779629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.676639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.621941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.567894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.531096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.493715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.364768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.279322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.117205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0682477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Response to intervention","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_to_intervention"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"651","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/651"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/219"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Size-exclusion chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Size-exclusion_chromatography"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"}]}
