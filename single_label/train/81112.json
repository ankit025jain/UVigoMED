{"id":81112,"title":"[The comparison of algorithms on the CT image retrieval of Xinjiang local liver hydatid disease].","abstract":"Xinjiang local liver hydatid disease is an infectious parasitic disease in Xinjiang pastoral areas. Based on the image features, selecting the appropriate distance algorithms to retrieve the image quickly and accurately, different distance algorithms have been induced in this area, which can greatly assist the doctors to early detect, diagnose and cure the liver hydatid disease. This paper compared the performance of different distance algorithms to retrieve the image when using the liver hydatid disease medical image texture features. The results showed that: for the liver hydatid disease medical images retrieval based on gray level cocurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features, the Mahalanobis distance algorithm is superior to other distance algorithms.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459948","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Parasitic disease","weight":0.690567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.546195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.536687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.487161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.405052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Xinjiang","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.298472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.17034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Mahalanobis distance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Texture mapping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Image retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_retrieval"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Grayscale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Pastoralism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralism"},{"name":"BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGM-109G_Ground_Launched_Cruise_Missile"}]}
