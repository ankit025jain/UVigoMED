{"id":82694,"title":"[Clinical features of accessory parotid gland tumors].","abstract":"Accessory parotid gland tumors are relatively rare; hence, adequately detailed clinical analyses of these tumors are difficult to perform at a single institution. In this report, we describe the findings for 65 patients [29 men, 36 women; median age, 51 (9-81) years] with accessory parotid gland tumors, consisting of 4 cases documented by us and 61 cases previously reported by other Japanese authors. Approximately 50% of the patients were treated in an otolaryngology department, while the remaining patients were treated in plastic surgery, oral surgery, or dermatology departments. In 4 patients, the results of preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology indicated that the tumor was benign; however, the postoperative histopathology results revealed malignant tumors. The frequencies of malignant and benign tumors were 44.6% (n = 29) and 55.4% (n = 36), respectively. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma and pleomorphic adenoma were the most frequent types of malignant and benign accessory parotid gland tumors, respectively. Among the various surgical methods that were used, such as direct cheek and intraoral incisions, a standard parotidectomy incision was the most preferred treatment approach for these tumors. Recently, an endoscopic approach has also been found to yield satisfactory results. An optimal approach should be selected after evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. No definite guidelines are available regarding the choice of elective neck dissection and postoperative radiation therapy for malignant accessory parotid gland tumors. Although tumor resection (plus elective neck dissection) and postoperative radiation therapy have been frequently performed for various kinds of malignant accessory parotid gland tumors to date, additional studies are needed regarding the criteria for selecting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiation therapy. Since the malignancy rate for accessory parotid gland tumors is higher than that for parotid gland tumors, the possibility of malignancy (especially mucoepidermoid carcinoma and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma) should be considered when resecting accessory parotid gland tumors, even if the results of preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology indicate that the tumor is benign.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558945","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.849703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.847261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.770479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.717004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.700925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Oral surgery","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_surgery"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.596657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.544749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.513739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.376389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma","weight":0.368186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucoepidermoid_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.342869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Pleomorphic adenoma","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphic_adenoma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"}]}
