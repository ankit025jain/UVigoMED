{"id":78222,"title":"[Prospective efficacy of chronic sinusitis lost to short-term follow up after nasal endoscopic surgery].","abstract":"To investigate the prospective efficacy of chronic sinusitis lost to short-term follow up after nasal endoscopic surgery and the influential factors.Prospective efficacy of 153 chronic sinusitis (CRS) was evaluated . All cases were treated by nasal endoscopic surgery at least 1 year ago but lost to follow up within 3 months after surgery. The clinical data of 153 patients were analyzed, including gender, age, educational level, course of the disease, smoking and drinking history, early surgery history, allergic rhinitis (AR) history, nasal polyps, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, nasal endoscopy score, CT examination score, the endoscopic experience of surgeons, medication of intranasal glucocorticoid and nasal irrigation after surgery. Multifactor logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data.Among 153 patient, the symptoms of 32 cases (20.9%) were completely control, while those of 74 cases (48.4% ) were partially control, and the symptoms of 47 cases (30.7%) were not controlled. The curative effect were better for CRS without nasal polyps, AR or early surgery history, with CT examination score < or = 5, operated by surgeons with experience of endoscopy surgery for more than 5 years. and treated with intranasal glucocorticoid for more than -1 weeks after surgery.Postsurgery follow-up should be paid more attention to in treatment of CRS. Plans of follow up should be adjusted to patients condition. Treatment of postoperative sinus cavity should be minimized when the lesion is slight and operated properly.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738306","annotations":[{"name":"Nasal irrigation","weight":0.894133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_irrigation"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Nasal polyp","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.799994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.722248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.718477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.694876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.603042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.560502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.458832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
