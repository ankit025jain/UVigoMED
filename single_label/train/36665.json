{"id":36665,"title":"Iatrogenic May-Thurner syndrome after EVAR.","abstract":"May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is caused by compression of the left iliac vein between the right common iliac artery and the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, resulting in hemodynamic compromise to venous return and intimal hyperplasia of the vein from chronic pulsatile compression. We report a case of MTS resulting from placement of an aortic stent graft for aneurysm repair. A higher index of suspicion and a more comprehensive initial venous duplex investigation, which should include the suprainguinal veins, should be considered in those patients with new onset of unilateral limb swelling after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).
