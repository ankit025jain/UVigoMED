{"id":47038,"title":"Asymmetric dimethylarginine responses during interferon-?-induced depression in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the association of depressive symptoms with asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection were examined during interferon-? (IFN-?) treatment, which is often associated with treatment-induced depression. The associations between IFN-?-induced depressive symptoms with ADMA and SDMA levels were prospectively investigated until 3 months after treatment.Psychiatric and biological assessments were obtained at six different time points: before, during (at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months), and after the end of IFN-? treatment.During IFN-? treatment, 22 (53.7%) patients fulfilled the criteria for a treatment-related depressive disorder at least once during treatment. The increase in ADMA levels from baseline (depression group: 0.63 [0.08] ?M, no depression group: 0.69 [0.08] ?M) in response to IFN-? treatment was considerably higher in patients with IFN-? treatment-induced depressive episodes compared with patients without treatment-induced depressive episodes (3 months after the start of treatment: depression group: 0.72 [0.08] ?M, no depression group: 0.72 [0.11] ?M; ADMA: repeated-measure design analysis of variance [time Ã— depression]: F(5,151) = 2.446, p = .036). The increase in SDMA was not associated with treatment-induced depression.Depression in response to IFN-? treatment is associated with elevated ADMA levels. These findings are relevant to nitric oxide-related biological pathways linking depression to increased cardiovascular disease risk. Future studies are needed to clarify the role of serotonin in these pathways and may lead to preventative treatment strategies.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608038","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.840208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.680619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Asymmetric dimethylarginine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_dimethylarginine"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"}]}
