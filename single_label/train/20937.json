{"id":20937,"title":"The impact of multidrug resistance on outcomes in ventilator-associated pneumonia.","abstract":"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms in ventilator-associated pneumonia were found in 49 of 107 patients and were associated with home antibiotics, pre-ventilator-associated pneumonia hospital stay, and health care exposure. Overall, MDR organisms were associated with increased mortality (P = .006). On multivariate analysis, MDR status was modulated by organism class. In nonfermenting gram-negative rods, no association between MDR and mortality was found, but, in all other organisms, MDR was associated with increased mortality risk (hazard ratio, 6.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.80-21.05, P = .004).","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630700","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.602344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.598868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.49807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.493674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.43388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.428706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Fermentation (biochemistry)","weight":0.405469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Rod cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
