{"id":33435,"title":"Late onset aneurysm development following radiosurgical obliteration of a cerebellopontine angle meningioma.","abstract":"The development of de novo intracranial aneurysms following stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial pathology is a rare complication secondary to vascular injury. Typically, these aneurysms develop within the first few years after radiation surgery. We present the first case of an aneurysm developing 10 years after radiosurgery for a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. This case highlights the importance of careful long-term follow-up of patients who undergo radiosurgery for lesions abutting major vessels and/or who suffer post-radiation complications.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827655","annotations":[{"name":"Meningioma","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningioma"},{"name":"Radiosurgery","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.550962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.523477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.279322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.20368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cerebellopontine angle","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellopontine_angle"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"}]}
