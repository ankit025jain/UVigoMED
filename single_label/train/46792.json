{"id":46792,"title":"Acute pain services following surgery for colorectal cancer.","abstract":"This paper evaluates the pain management provided to patients following surgery for colorectal cancer. These patients were part of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programme, which among other goals, aims to reduce length of hospital stay. The aim of the service evaluation was to investigate the success of the pain service in meeting the needs of the patients in relation to provision of analgesia for their postoperative recovery, ensuring that the ERAS programme wasn't compromising patient satisfaction. Findings demonstrate high levels of satisfaction with pain management and the approach of staff. The study also reinforces findings that there is a paradoxical link between pain intensity and patient satisfaction. However, despite advances in care, treatments and services, patients continue to experience high levels of pain after surgery and recommendations are made on how pain management services provided to patients after surgery might be enhanced.
