{"id":25729,"title":"[Role of multidetector computed tomography and stress- echocardiography in assessment of risk of cardiological complications of non-cardiac surgery].","abstract":"to compare results of coronary angiography with data of multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) - angiography, and analyze rate of detection of hemodynamically significant coronary artery lesions during preoperative examination of patients.We analyzed case histories of 92 patients (median age 59 years) examined prior to surgery on non-coronary vessels or for exclusion of ischemic heart disease. All patients were subjected to selective coronary angiography (CA) and MSCT - angiography. According to results of CA we formed 2 groups - with coronary artery stenoses >70% (n=55, group 1) and <70% (n=37, group 2). In 46 patients (50%) dobutamine stress echocardiography was performed for detection of concealed coronary insufficiency.CA revealed hemodynamically significant stenoses >70% (>50% in left main coronary artery) in 91 of 324 arteries. MSCT angiography detected stenosis >50% in 184 of 324 arteries; in 148 patients results of MSCT were confirmed by presence of hemodynamically significant stenoses at coronary angiography (sensitivity 86%). Absence of lesions or presence of stenoses <50% were noted at MSCT in 368 arteries; in 345 cases this was confirmed by coronary angiography (predictive value of negative result 94%, specificity 91%). Result of dobutamine stress echocardiography was positive in 41% of patients in group 1 and in 20% - of group 2 (<0.001). Sensitivity of stress echocardiography for detection of significant stenoses was 41%, specificity - 80%, negative predictive value - 14%.Diagnostic value of MSCT for detection of coronary artery stenoses >70% have better sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of compared with stress echocardiography. Results of this study confirm value of MSCT angiography for diagnosis of coronary atherosclerosis and allow to recommend it as a screening method for detection hemodynamically significant coronary artery involvement before extracardiac surgery.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177886","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.78463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.745333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.711043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.705757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.512662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.494297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Left coronary artery","weight":0.275391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Dobutamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobutamine"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"}]}
