{"id":11648,"title":"Host bone marrow-derived IL-12 enhances donor T cell engraftment in a mouse model of bone marrow transplantation.","abstract":"Donor cell engraftment is critical for the success of allogeneic bone marrow transplants. Graft failure is a result of donor cells either failing to engraft initially or being eliminated at later time points. Donor cell engraftment is facilitated by donor T cells, which eliminate residual host hemato-lymphoid effector cells such as NK cells and T cells.We aimed to explore the role of host hematopoietic cell derived IL-12 on donor cell engraftment in a murine model of BMT. We established radiation chimeras by transplanting C57BL6/J (B6) mice with BM from either congenic B6 mice or IL-12p40 KO mice. These WT ? WT or IL-12 KO ? WT chimeras then underwent a secondary transplant with allogeneic (FVB) BM. Survival, engraftment, donor T cell expansion, cytokine production by donor T cells, as well as expression of stimulatory markers on donor T cells was analyzed.Mice whose residual host hematopoietic cells were capable of producing IL-12 had modestly higher survival, higher donor T cell engraftment, and significantly higher donor erythroid engraftment. We have also found that an increased number of donor T cells in IL-12 KO ? WT chimeras have a regulatory phenotype, expressing FoxP3, producing lower levels of TNF-?, higher levels of IL-10, and expressing higher levels of ICOS as well as PD-1 on CD4+ T cells.To our knowledge, this is the first report of a beneficial role of IL-12 production by host cells in the context of bone marrow engraftment in a murine model of BMT. These findings support the clinical use of exogenous IL-12 for use in settings where graft failure is of concern.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24580829","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.861023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.755594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.75005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.746127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.666585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chimera (genetics)","weight":0.487323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.480451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.301595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.256502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"CD278","weight":0.236629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD278"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.204374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.165522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0583839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
