{"id":83348,"title":"[Relaparotomy and programmed sanation of the abdominal cavity in treatment of early postoperative complications].","abstract":"The structure and causes of postoperative complications occurrence, necessitating early relaparotomy conduction through last 5 yrs and 30 yrs ago, were analyzed. The complications rate almost did not change, but their structure--essentially. The occurrence rate for eventration, adhesive ileus, relaparotomy performance for abdominal cavity abscess have had lowered significantly due to introduction of a new operative technologies and prophylactic measures. The lowering of lethality after relaparotomy is caused by improvement of the complications diagnosis, timely performance of reoperations, application of laparostomy in the treatment of postoperative peritonitis, what have permitted to govern a postoperative period course.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417279","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.477511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.353637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.223677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.168905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Ileus","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileus"},{"name":"Abdominal cavity","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cavity"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Sanation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanation"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
