{"id":50304,"title":"Ectopic over-expression of miR-429 induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and increased drug sensitivity in metastasizing ovarian cancer cells.","abstract":"We recently determined that the ectopic over-expression of miR-429 and other members of the miR-200 family of microRNAs in ovarian cancer (OC) mesenchymal-like cell lines induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) with a concomitant increase in sensitivity to platinum drugs. We sought to determine if metastasizing OC cells isolated from an OC patient could also be induced by miR-429 to undergo MET and become sensitized to established first-line platinum-based therapies.We established and characterized a new primary cell line (OCI-984) from free-floating OC cells isolated from the ascites fluid of an advanced stage OC patient. miR-429 was ectopically over-expressed in these cells.The over-expression of miR-429 in OCI-984 cells induced morphological, functional and molecular changes consistent with MET and a concomitant significant increase in the sensitivity of the converted cells to cisplatin.Our findings indicate that the miR-200 family of microRNAs, and miR-429 in particular, play a critical role in the functioning of OC metastasizing cells and that targeted delivery of miR-429, and perhaps other miR-200 family members, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapies may be an effective strategy in reducing OC metastasis and tumor recurrence.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802724","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.761851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.608387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.540269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.475314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.444757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.29854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.225053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"C-Met","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Met"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"}]}
