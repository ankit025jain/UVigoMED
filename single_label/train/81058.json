{"id":81058,"title":"Spatial and seasonal distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis in Dracena, a city in the western region of the State of São Paulo, Brazil, that is endemic with visceral leishmaniasis.","abstract":"Vector seasonality knowledge is important for monitoring and controlling of vector-borne diseases. Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lu. longipalpis) is the main vector of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum Nicolle, 1908, which is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas.Lu. longipalpis was monitored for 3 consecutive nights each month using light traps from the Centers for Disease Control in the peridomiciles and intradomiciles of 18 residences from January 2005 to December 2012 in the urban area of Dracena, a medium-sized city located in the western region of São Paulo, Brazil.A total of 54,820 Lu. longipalpis specimens were collected, and the proportion of positive samples was significantly higher in the peridomiciles than in the intradomiciles (p<0.05) in all 8 years of the study, except for 2005. The vector was present in all study years in the 9 sub-regions of the city, and the male/female ratio ranged from 3.19 to 4.26. The greatest vector abundance occurred in the first semester and peaked in March, confirming its seasonality.The maintenance of this high abundance over an 8-year surveillance period demonstrates the vector adaptation to the urban conditions of the city. These characteristics present a major challenge for preventing human and canine contact with the vector and, consequently, controlling the spread of disease.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474011","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Americas","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.544634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.373701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Lutzomyia","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutzomyia"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Visceral leishmaniasis","weight":0.262608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visceral_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.148115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.112803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Leishmania infantum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania_infantum"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Animal trapping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_trapping"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Academic term","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term"},{"name":"Breeding season","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_season"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
