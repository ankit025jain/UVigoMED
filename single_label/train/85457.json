{"id":85457,"title":"Activation of TRPV1 mediates thymic stromal lymphopoietin release via the Ca2+/NFAT pathway in airway epithelial cells.","abstract":"The airway epithelium is exposed to a range of irritants in the environment that are known to trigger inflammatory response such as asthma. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel critical for detecting noxious stimuli by sensory neurons. Recently increasing evidence suggests TRPV1 is also crucially involved in the pathophysiology of asthma on airway epithelium in human. Here we report that in airway epithelial cells TRPV1 activation potently induces allergic cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) release. TSLP induction by protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2 activation is also partially mediated by TRPV1 channels.
