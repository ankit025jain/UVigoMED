{"id":81146,"title":"Molecular detection of Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense in humans, China.","abstract":"The cause of diphyllobothriosis in 5 persons in Harbin and Shanghai, China, during 2008-2011, initially attributed to the tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum, was confirmed as D. nihonkaiense by using molecular analysis of expelled proglottids. The use of morphologic characteristics alone to identify this organism was inadequate and led to misidentification of the species.
