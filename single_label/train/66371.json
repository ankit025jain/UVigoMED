{"id":66371,"title":"Two-step irradiance schedule versus single-dose tramadol sustained-release tablets for pain control during topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy of condyloma acuminatum in Chinese patients: a randomized comparative study.","abstract":"Photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT) offers promising results for the treatment of condyloma acuminatum. However, patients have to dwell with pain to benefit from this otherwise effective and safe \"off-label\" treatment modality. Several techniques have been explored to control ALA-PDT-induced pain, but the desperate search for a universally accepted method is still ongoing. This study compares the two-step irradiance approach with single-dose administration of 100?mg tramadol sustained-release tablets for pain induced by ALA-PDT of condyloma acuminatum in Chinese patients.Adult Chinese patients with condyloma acuminatum were enrolled in a randomized comparative study. Pain levels were compared using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at pre-defined assessment points during and after irradiation.The pain was dominated by characteristics such as burning and pricking and was almost always local and superficial.The median pain scores were lower in the two-step irradiance group at 1?minute (U?=?621.5, P?=?0.002) but higher at 20?minutes (U?=?585.5, P?=?0.002). The median pain scores between the two groups did not differ significantly at other assessment points. The pain was moderate in both groups and peaked earlier in the analgesics group (median: 5?minutes) but later in the two-step irradiance group (median: 15?minutes).The pain was generally mild. The median pain scores were equal at each assessment point, except at 3?hours where the median was lower in the analgesics group (1.0) as compared with the two-step irradiance group (2.0) (U?=?725.0, P?=?0.056).Pain in the two-step irradiance protocol is irradiance-dependent. The two-step irradiance approach produces significant benefits over analgesics during the initial stages of therapy but analgesics offer significant benefits thereafter. There are potential benefits of combining the two approaches in minimizing ALA-PDT-induced pain.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719394","annotations":[{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.74448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.729883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.675676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.480804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"Genital wart","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genital_wart"},{"name":"Tramadol","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.422766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.296664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"China","weight":0.190815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Aminolevulinic acid","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminolevulinic_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Floating point","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point"},{"name":"585","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/585"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"University of California Natural Reserve System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California_Natural_Reserve_System"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"High Sheriff","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Sheriff"},{"name":"Uncial 056","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_056"}]}
