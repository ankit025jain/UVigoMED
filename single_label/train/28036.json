{"id":28036,"title":"Brain serotonin synthesis in MDMA (ecstasy) polydrug users: an alpha-[(11) C]methyl-l-tryptophan study.","abstract":"3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) use may have long-term neurotoxic effects. In this study, positron emission tomography with the tracer alpha-[(11) C]methyl-l-tryptophan ((11) C-AMT) was used to compare human brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis capacity in 17 currently drug-free MDMA polydrug users with that in 18 healthy matched controls. Gender differences and associations between regional (11) C-AMT trapping and characteristics of MDMA use were also examined. MDMA polydrug users exhibited lower normalized (11) C-AMT trapping in pre-frontal, orbitofrontal, and parietal regions, relative to controls. These differences were more widespread in males than in females. Increased normalized (11) C-AMT trapping in MDMA users was also observed, mainly in the brainstem and in frontal and temporal areas. Normalized (11) C-AMT trapping in the brainstem and pre-frontal regions correlated positively and negatively, respectively, with greater lifetime accumulated MDMA use, longer durations of MDMA use, and shorter time elapsed since the last MDMA use. Although the possibility of pre-existing 5-HT alterations pre-disposing people to use MDMA cannot be ruled out, regionally decreased 5-HT synthesis capacity in the forebrain could be interpreted as neurotoxicity of MDMA on distal (frontal) brain regions. On the other hand, increased 5-HT synthesis capacity in the raphe and adjacent areas could be due to compensatory mechanisms.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041501","annotations":[{"name":"MDMA","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Forebrain","weight":0.759961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forebrain"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.737494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Prefrontal cortex","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Parietal lobe","weight":0.717878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.565289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Orbitofrontal cortex","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitofrontal_cortex"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Raphe nuclei","weight":0.370783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphe_nuclei"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"List of regions in the human brain","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.21786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.109956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Poly drug use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_drug_use"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Alpha (ethology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(ethology)"}]}
