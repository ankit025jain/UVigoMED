{"id":61910,"title":"Role of minimal residual disease and chimerism after reduced-intensity and myeloablative allo-transplantation in acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.","abstract":"We evaluated the impact of detection of minimal residual disease by flow cytometry (FCMRD) and CD3 chimerism in relapse in a cohort of 87 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing stem cell transplantation. Patients with a positive FCMRD at day +100 after transplantation showed higher relapse rates and worse overall survival. In multivariate analysis, a positive FCMRD after transplantation was a significant predictor of relapse. Mixed chimerism showed a trend to statistical signification. We conclude that FCMRD at day 100 after SCT is the best predictor of relapse after SCT in patients with aggressive myeloid malignancies.
