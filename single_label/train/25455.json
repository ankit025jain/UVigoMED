{"id":25455,"title":"[Chinese classical formulas for treatment of essential hypertension].","abstract":"Essential hypertension is one of the most prevalent and important public health concerns in both westernized and developing countries. Recent studies have demonstrated that successful long-term treatment of hypertension has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and stroke. Chinese classical formulas, which are important components of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), have been increasingly accepted by patients with CVDs worldwide. According to TCM theory and syndrome differentiation, hypertension could be categorized into 3 patterns including fire syndrome, fluid retention syndrome, and deficiency syndrome. Chinese classical formulas, including Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli tang, Tianma Gouteng yin, Zhen Gan Xifeng tang, Banxia Baizhu Tianma tang, Liu Wei Dihuang wan, etc, play an important role in the treatment of essential hypertension, which could be further research priorities.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25204193","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.748581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.705356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.589042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.410425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.279122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Chinese literature","weight":0.127125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_literature"},{"name":"Fire","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Essential hypertension","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_hypertension"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Water retention (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_retention_(medicine)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Cao Wei","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Wei"}]}
