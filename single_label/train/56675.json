{"id":56675,"title":"Iatrogenic retinal breaks in 25-gauge vitrectomy under air compared with the standard 25-gauge system for macular diseases.","abstract":"To evaluate the incidence rates of iatrogenic retinal breaks in eyes that underwent 25-gauge vitrectomy under air compared with 25-gauge standard vitrectomy for idiopathic macular holes or idiopathic epiretinal membranes.In this retrospective, comparative interventional study, 435 eyes were enrolled. In all patients after core vitrectomy and epiretinal/inner limiting membrane peeling, complete vitrectomy of the base was performed, respectively under air (air group) or under fluid infusion (standard group).The number of eyes with iatrogenic retinal breaks was significantly lower in the air group than in standard group (4/197 and 16/238, 2% and 7%, respectively; P = 0.035). A postoperative retinal detachment developed in 2 eyes (1%) in the standard group, and in no eyes of the air group (0%). Factors related to the occurrence of retinal breaks were surgically induced posterior vitreous detachment (P = 0.006), standard vitrectomy (P = 0.023), and surgery for macular hole (P = 0.030).The 25-gauge vitrectomy under air is associated with a lower incidence rate of retinal breaks compared with the standard 25-gauge vitrectomy.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651259","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.608405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.532968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.403118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.361872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.340867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.27468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.272918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Epiretinal membrane","weight":0.113797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiretinal_membrane"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Posterior vitreous detachment","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_vitreous_detachment"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Group (military aviation unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(military_aviation_unit)"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Electron hole","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
