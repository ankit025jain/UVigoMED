{"id":69018,"title":"Clinical utility of serum cystatin C in predicting coronary artery disease in patients without chronic kidney disease.","abstract":"Cystatin C has been proposed as a novel marker of renal function and predictor of cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of cystatin C level as a predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).Three hundred and five coronary artery patients were included in this study. Serum cystatin C levels, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and oxidative stress were measured. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the CAD severity score were calculated.Cystatin C was correlated with the CAD severity score (r = 0.631, P < 0.0001) and was significantly elevated in the CAD severity score >50. Every 0.1 mg/l increase in cystatin C, 2 mg/l increase in hs-CRP, 0.2 mmol/l decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 13.7 ml/min decrease in eGFR, and 1.51 ?mol/l increase in homocysteine caused a 34, 12, 5, and 22% increase in the risk of having CAD, respectively.Cystatin C could be a useful laboratory biochemical marker in predicting the severity of CAD. Cystatin C is associated with biochemical atherosclerosis markers such as CRP and homocysteine.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478035","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.862549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.777237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.712152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.71171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.706451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.669984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.53008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.420769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cystatin C","weight":0.182246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin_C"},{"name":"Cystatin","weight":0.12669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Water filter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_filter"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
