It is shown that the recipient's body is actively working to exogenous material , destroying its surface layer and forms around the implant insulating fibro-connective tissue capsule, the thickness of which depends on the severity of the organism's reaction to a foreign body. Proposed instrumental method of determining compatibility before surgery implant material with the recipient using an atomic force microscope (AFM).","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923157","annotations":[{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.734501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Insulator (electrical)","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electrical)"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.503087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Atomic force microscopy","weight":0.468049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.245507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Instrumental","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Surface layer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_layer"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"}]}
