{"id":84297,"title":"Cytotoxicity of purified listeriolysin O on mouse and human leukocytes and leukaemia cells.","abstract":"Listeriolysin O (LLO) is the main virulence factor of Listeria monocytogenes and facilitates the intracellular survival of the pathogen. Some of its characteristics endorse the growing popularity of LLO for use in biotechnology, particularly in the development of novel vaccines. Here, we evaluate the use of LLO to eradicate leukaemia cells.A purified LLO preparation was obtained by affinity chromatography. The LLO preparation procedure was optimized and purified LLO was tested for optimal conditions of storage including temperature, application of proteinase inhibitors and serum components. We demonstrated the possibility of regulating LLO activity by adjusting cell membrane cholesterol content. The LLO preparation had haemolytic activity and had a cytotoxic effect on the human T-leukaemia Jurkat cell line as well as mouse and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.LLO has a very potent cytotoxic activity towards human leukocytes. Importantly, the cytotoxic activity was easily regulated in vitro and could be restricted to areas containing malignant cells, raising the possibility of future clinical application of LLO for leukaemia treatment.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
