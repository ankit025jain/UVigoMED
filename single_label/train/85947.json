{"id":85947,"title":"Reducing admissions with patient group directions.","abstract":"In times of financial restrictions and reform impediments, health services need to invest in resources that provide value for money and reduce hospital admissions. Improving disease management in the community is a primary target for those trying to reduce costs. The second most common cause of emergency admissions to hospital is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and it has been suggested that more effective treatments and better management of the condition would likely result in an estimated 5% fewer admissions to hospital, saving around pound 15.5m each year. This article discusses how savings could be made by improving care provided in the community.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834601","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.803461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.499514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Investment","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Money","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.263403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.203312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Value (economics)","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Pound sterling","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Reform movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_movement"},{"name":"Food waste in the United Kingdom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_waste_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Disease management (health)","weight":0.0134987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_management_(health)"}]}
