{"id":13199,"title":"Changes in motor unit properties in SOD1 (G93A) rats.","abstract":"In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive death of motor neurons results in denervation and reinnervation of muscles. It is not clear how ALS affects the properties of motor units (MUs).Properties of single MUs in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle of rats bearing the human mutated superoxide dismutase gene type 1 (SOD1) were determined at 3 stages: asymptomatic (ALS I); early symptomatic (ALS II); and terminal (ALS III).In ALS II, higher proportions of FF (fast fatigable) and S (slow) MUs were observed, whereas in ALS III higher percentages of S and lower percentages of FF MUs were noted compared with controls. S motor neurons reinnervated fast muscle fibers, and those MUs gained some properties of fast MUs, including lower fatigue resistance, greater force generation, and higher action potential amplitudes.Changes in MU properties of SOD1 rats have progressive and multidirectional character and speed depending on the MU type.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488615","annotations":[{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.78851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.611048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.554218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.442974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gastrocnemius muscle","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrocnemius_muscle"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.396406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.370048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Motor unit","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.336637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Reinnervation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinnervation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.180374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"G93A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G93A"},{"name":"SOD1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOD1"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Multiple unit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_unit"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"MG Cars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_thoracic_sympathectomy"},{"name":"Technical death metal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_death_metal"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Fatigue (material)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(material)"},{"name":"Probability amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"}]}
