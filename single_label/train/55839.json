{"id":55839,"title":"[Meta analysis on acupuncture-moxibustion for amblyopia [correction of agrypnia] ].","abstract":"The effectiveness and safety of acupuncture-moxibustion for the treatment of agrypnia was systematically reviewed. The clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture-moxibustion for agrypnia were collected. The literature and document on acupuncture-moxibustion RCT for the treatment of agrypnia that published from January of 2001 to March of 2012 was searched with computer in PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP database. According to Cochrane Handbook 5. 1. 0, the bias risk and quality assessment were performed on every included trial and RevMan 5. 0 software was applied to make the Meta analysis. Totally 14 researches were included, involving 2662 cases. The Meta analysis showed that the differences of total effective rate between acupuncture-moxibustion and clinical routine treatment were significant [RR = 1.16, 95% CI (1.12, 1.19), Z = 9.32, P < 0.000 01]. The results indicate that total effective rate of acupuncture-moxibustion for agrypnia is obviously superior to that of clinical routine treatment, meaning clinical efficacy of acupuncture-moxibustion is served credit.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796072","annotations":[{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.962322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.622214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.358563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.28548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.179636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Credit card","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card"},{"name":"Wanfang","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanfang"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Very Important Person","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Important_Person"}]}
