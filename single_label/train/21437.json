The manual method for CRE screening was useful for detecting patients with asymptomatic CRE carriage but was time-consuming and costly.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602952","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.582528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.20453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"University","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Delhi","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.10298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"New Delhi","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Acute care","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"}]}
