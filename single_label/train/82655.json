{"id":82655,"title":"Comparative performance of two whitening systems in a dental practice.","abstract":"A randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare the safety and whitening efficacy of high-adhesion tooth-whitening strips with a marketed in-office professional tooth-whitening system.This open-label study was conducted in a private dental practice, and adult volunteers were assigned (2:1) to either 9.5 percent hydrogen-peroxide whitening strips (Strip group) or an in-office light plus 25 percent hydrogen-peroxide whitening gel treatment (In-office group). The Strip group was instructed to treat the maxillary arch once daily for 30 minutes over a 20-day period, while the In-office group underwent professional application of light plus whitening gel in a single office visit. Whitening response was measured as change in yellowness (b*) and lightness (L*) at Day 21 using standardized digital images of the maxillary anterior teeth, while safety was assessed as tooth sensitivity and oral irritation occurrence. A total of 45 subjects enrolled, were randomized, and received treatment; 44 completed the study.At Day 21, significant improvement in b* and L* was noted in both groups (P?0.001). The adjusted mean (SE) ?L* in the Strip group (1.72 (0.104)) was significantly greater than that in the In-office group (1.17 (0.153)) (P = 0.005). Both test products were well tolerated. Overall, both the strip and in-office treatments resulted in significant tooth whitening.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568171","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.834931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.444309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.298199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.240731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tooth bleaching","weight":0.236412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_bleaching"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.208685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.150665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Dentine hypersensitivity","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentine_hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Las Vegas Strip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Digital image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Lightness (color)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness_(color)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Day 21","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_21"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
