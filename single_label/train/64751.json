{"id":64751,"title":"[Extracorporeal shockwave therapy for erectile dysfunction and Peyronie's disease].","abstract":"Penile vascular endothelial damage, vasomotor dysfunction, and blood flow deficiency are the major causes of erectile dysfunction (ED). Current management of ED mostly depends on selective phosphodiesterase type 5- (PDE5) inhibitors, which fail for some ED patients. For Peyronie's disease-induced ED, surgical and physical therapies are used in addition to PDE5I medication, but frequently it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Recent studies show that the low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy can promote angiogenesis and improve blood flow to the penis, which promises to be a novel effective therapy for ED and Peyronie's disease.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306816","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.746574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.642497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.6223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.451051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.32596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.323873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.3217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"CGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5","weight":0.13779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGMP-specific_phosphodiesterase_type_5"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"PDE5 inhibitor","weight":0.0682051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDE5_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Shock wave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"}]}
