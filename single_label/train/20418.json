{"id":20418,"title":"An unusual case of invasive Aspergillus ulcerative tracheobronchitis without involvement of lung parenchyma in a post-renal transplant patient.","abstract":"We present the case of a 54-year-old male, who presented with respiratory complaints four months after he underwent renal transplantation. Bronchoscopy showed ulcerated mucosa of the left main bronchus and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed foci of air within the bronchial wall. A biopsy from the lesion showed septate fungal hyphae, dichotomously branching at acute angles. A locally invasive Aspergillus ulcerative tracheobronchitis with no parenchymal involvement is an important cause of tracheobronchitis in post-renal transplant patients. An early diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment can improve the outcome. A combination treatment of caspofungin and voriconazole can be considered if patient is not responding to voriconazole alone.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660566","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Bronchus","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.73604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Caspofungin","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspofungin"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aspergillus","weight":0.624281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.199836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Voriconazole","weight":0.176389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voriconazole"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.140536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0551913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Hypha","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha"},{"name":"Trabecular meshwork","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecular_meshwork"}]}
