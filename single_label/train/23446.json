{"id":23446,"title":"Assessing the impact of an educational intervention on ventilator-associated pneumonia in a pediatric critical care unit.","abstract":"Ongoing educational programs targeting health care professionals have shown positive outcomes by reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with health care-associated infections (HAIs). We undertook this study to measure the impact of such a program in a pediatric critical care unit of a developing country.This prospective study was conducted in 2 time periods of 6 months each, with an educational intervention for resident doctors and nurses in between. The rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) during the preintervention and postintervention periods were estimated by active surveillance.The incidence density of VAP was reduced by 28% (20.2 vs 14.6 per 1,000 ventilator-days; P = .21, Z test) despite a significant increase in the ventilator utilization ratio during the postintervention period (0.64 vs 0.88; P < .0001, Pearson's ?² test). There was a statistically significant reduction in mortality among patients who received mechanical ventilation for ?48 hours in the postintervention period (49.3% vs 31.4%; P = .029, Pearson's ?² test).Educational programs have a positive impact on reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HAIs. Incidence rates based on device-days should be compared by keeping the variations in device utilization ratio in mind.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485367","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.764492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.711976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.698854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.307561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.288651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"VAP (company)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAP_(company)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Prison education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_education"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"}]}
