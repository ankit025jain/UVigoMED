{"id":55561,"title":"Effect of diquafosol tetrasodium eye drop for persistent dry eye after laser in situ keratomileusis.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of diquafosol tetrasodium (DQS) for the treatment of persistent dry eye after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).Miyata Eye Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.Noncomparative case series.This prospective study included 30 eyes of 15 patients in whom dry eye had persisted for over 12 months after LASIK, and the symptoms had not improved with artificial tears and sodium hyaluronate treatment. In addition, treatment with DQS 3% eye drops, 6 times a day, was performed for 12 weeks. Best-corrected visual acuity, tear secretion with the Schirmer test, tear break-up time, and fluorescein and lissamine green staining scores on the cornea and conjunctiva were examined before and at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after the addition. A subjective questionnaire of 14 symptoms was also assessed before and 12 weeks after treatment.The fluorescein and lissamine green staining scores significantly improved over 12 weeks; however, the best-corrected visual acuity and tear secretion did not change. The symptoms of fatigue, dryness, grittiness, discomfort, difficulty in reading, and discomfort within the area of dryness improved after the additional DQS treatment.The DQS treatment improved the subjective and objective symptoms of persistent dry eye after LASIK. Increased mucin production because of the addition of DQS probably improved the tear film stability and reduced the symptoms of dry eye in patients who had persistent dry eye after LASIK.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858017","annotations":[{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.886648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.847851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.605038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.572399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.564519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.519526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.508614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Artificial tears","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_tears"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Schirmer's test","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schirmer's_test"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Miyata","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyata"},{"name":"G.
