{"id":78501,"title":"The hybrid tracheoesophageal puncture procedure: indications and outcomes.","abstract":"This report aimed to describe a novel and efficient method of tracheoesophageal puncture using a hybrid device assembled from 2 commercially available puncture kits; to demonstrate the utility of this technique in the performance of primary and secondary procedures, under general and local anesthesia, with and without flap reconstruction; and to evaluate the efficacy of concurrent puncture and valve placement.Thirty-four patients who underwent either primary or secondary tracheoesophageal puncture for voice restoration. Charts were reviewed retrospectively for complications, time to first valve change, operative time, and blood loss.Using this novel hybrid device, simultaneous puncture and valve placement was achieved in 34 consecutive patients. There was 1 major complication; blood loss was negligible; and the procedure could be accomplished in all cases. There were no cases of prosthesis failure as a result of the insertion technique.Concurrent tracheoesophageal puncture and voice prosthesis placement is a simple and efficient method of voice restoration in the laryngectomized patient and can be more easily accomplished with a hybrid device assembled from the components of 2 commercially available puncture kits. It can be performed under local as well as general anesthesia. The procedure is adaptable to a variety of clinical situations.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642586","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.67841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.500042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.365993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Tracheo-oesophageal puncture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheo-oesophageal_puncture"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Drum kit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Negligible","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
