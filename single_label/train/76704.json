{"id":76704,"title":"Association between expression of FABPpm in skeletal muscle and insulin sensitivity in intramyocellular lipid-accumulated nonobese men.","abstract":"Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) accumulation is observed in both insulin-resistant subjects and insulin-sensitive endurance athletes (athlete's paradox). We hypothesized that the expression pattern of fatty acid transporters may influence oxidative capacity and determine the association between IMCL and insulin resistance.The objective of the study was to investigate the muscle expression of fatty acid transporters and their function related to insulin sensitivity in IMCL-accumulated subjects.The study subjects were 36 nonobese healthy men. Their IMCL levels were measured by (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and their insulin sensitivity was evaluated by steady-state glucose infusion rate (GIR) during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Gene expression levels in the vastus lateralis were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. We compared the clinical phenotypes and the expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle between IMCL-accumulated high-GIR (H-GIR) subjects (n = 8) and low-GIR subjects (n = 9). The functions of candidate fatty acid transporters were determined by in vitro analyses.Compared with the low-GIR group, body fat was lower and maximum oxygen uptake was higher in the H-GIR group. Several lipid oxidation genes in muscle were up-regulated in the H-GIR group, and this was associated with increased expression of higher plasma membrane-associated fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm) and decreased expression of fatty acid transport protein (FATP)-1. Overexpression of FABPpm in C2C12 myotubes increased fatty acid oxidation coupled with the elevated expression of genes related to fatty acid oxidation. These changes were not observed in FATP1-overexpressed myotubes.Differences in the gene expression of fatty acid transporters may, at least in part, affect insulin sensitivity in IMCL-accumulated nonobese men.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937540","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin
