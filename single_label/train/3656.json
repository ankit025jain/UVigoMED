{"id":3656,"title":"An evaluation of genotoxicity in human neuronal-type cells subjected to oxidative stress under an extremely low frequency pulsed magnetic field.","abstract":"The possible genotoxicity of extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) exposure is still a controversial topic. The most of the reported data suggests that it alone does not affect DNA integrity, but several recent reports have suggested that sinusoidal ELF-MF may increase the effect of known genotoxic agents. Only a few studies deal with non sinusoidal ELF-MF, including pulsed magnetic field (PMF), which are produced by several devices. The aim of this study is to investigate whether PMF exposure can interfere with DNA damage and repair in the presence of a genotoxic oxidative agent in neuronal type cells. To this purpose gamma-H2AX foci formation, which is a sensitive marker of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), was investigated at different points of time (1, 24, 48, 72h) after the H2O2 treatment (300?M for 1h) under PMF exposure (1mT, 50Hz) in human neuroblastoma BE(2)C cells. Moreover, cytotoxicity evaluation, by MTT assay and cell cycle analysis, was performed at various points of time after the treatment. Taken together, results suggest that PMF exposure does not interfere with genotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by oxidative stress.
