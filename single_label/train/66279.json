{"id":66279,"title":"The impact of acute renal failure on early and late outcomes after thoracic aortic endovascular repair.","abstract":"The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) after thoracic aortic endovascular repair (TEVAR) is variably reported at 1% to 34%. This study utilized the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure) criteria to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and late implications of AKI after TEVAR.In all, 350 patients without prior dialysis requirement underwent TEVAR (1993 to 2013). The mean age was 68.7 years (54% male). The mean preoperative glomerular filtration rate was 76.5 ± 37.6 mL/min, with 39 patients (11.7%) in chronic kidney stage 3 or 4. The TEVAR was performed for rupture in 20.6%. The mean contrast volume administered was 95.7 ± 52.9 mL.Early mortality was seen in 17 patients (4.9%). Acute kidney injury defined as RIFLE classes risk, injury, or failure was seen in 59 patients (17%; risk = 36, injury = 14, failure = 9). Independent predictors of AKI included history of saccular aneurysm, presentation with rupture, or need for arch repair or red blood cell transfusion (all p < 0.05). Only 2 patients (0.6%) needed dialysis, with none requiring permanent dialysis. Importantly, 10-year freedom from dialysis was 97.7%. Development of AKI predicted early mortality (p < 0.001, odds ratio 9.8). Ten-year survival was 38.1%. Both injury and failure AKI classes independently predicted late mortality (p < 0.05).The prevalence of AKI after TEVAR as assessed by RIFLE criteria is higher than seen in previous reports. Despite its infrequent progression to permanent dialysis dependence, AKI remains an important risk factor for both early and late mortality. Future studies should evaluate strategies to reduce the incidence of AKI after TEVAR to improve both early and late outcomes.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726602","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.610739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.343561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
