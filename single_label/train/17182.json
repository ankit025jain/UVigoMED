{"id":17182,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of rapid susceptibility testing against second-line drugs for tuberculosis.","abstract":"Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against second-line tuberculosis drugs (SLDs) is essential for improving outcomes among multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) cases.To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of rapid DST for SLDs.We constructed a decision analysis model of Xpert MTB/RIF-based TB diagnosis in East and South-East Asia to compare culture-based DST vs. a hypothetical rapid SLD DST system for specimens resistant to rifampin. Our primary outcomes were the effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness of a rapid SLD DST assay relative to culture-based DST.For rapid SLD DST to be more effective than culture-based DST, treating individuals with pre-XDR/XDR-TB with a standardized MDR-TB regimen while awaiting culture-based DST must incur at least 30% excess XDR-TB mortality (100% = treatment with first-line drugs); rapid SLD DST should attain an aggregate sensitivity and specificity for all pre-XDR/XDR mutations of 88% and 96%, respectively. The unit cost of the rapid SLD DST assay must approach that of culture to achieve common thresholds for cost-effectiveness in low-income countries.Rapid SLD DST has the potential to be cost-effective, but must meet stringent criteria for accuracy and costs, and requires that standardized second-line treatment for pre-XDR/XDR-TB incur substantial excess mortality before the return of culture results.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903933","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.851154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.732324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.365292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Decision analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensively_drug-resistant_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Daylight saving time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Second-level domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Democratic Left Alliance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Left_Alliance"},{"name":"Unit cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cost"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
