{"id":77668,"title":"\"Samosa\" pneumoconiosis: a case of pulmonary talcosis uncovered during a medicolegal autopsy.","abstract":"Talcosis is a rare form of pneumoconiosis caused by long-term exposure to talc (hydrous magnesium silicate) through inhalation or intravenous exposures. Although it occurs commonly as an occupational hazard or is due to abuse/overuse of talc, talcosis in the course of food adulteration is seldom or hardly reported. We present a case of talcosis in a worker who had considerable exposure to talc during the initial preparation of \"samosa,\" a triangular fried Indian savory. There were typical pulmonary histological findings of talcosis with extensive deposition of birefringent crystals in histiocytes. On account of this unusual pathogenesis, we have coined a new terminology \"samosa pneumoconiosis\" to describe this condition.
