{"id":13735,"title":"Cardioprotective role of P38 MAPK during myocardial infarction via parallel activation of ?-crystallin B and Nrf2.","abstract":"Myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as cardiac cell death due to prolonged ischemia. Although necrotic cell death was considered to be solely responsible for myocyte death during MI, it was recently revealed that apoptosis also plays its part in this death process. Our laboratory has recently shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis is the predominant route for apoptosis during MI and the conventional mitochondrial pathway is bypassed by activation of a small heat shock protein ?-crystallin B (CRYAB). Since CRYAB is a direct target of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, we were prompted to check the role of P38 MAPK in 20-week-old male Wister rats immediately after infarct formation. Interestingly, parallel activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway with an increase in ER stress-induced apoptotic load was observed along with decreased activation of CRYAB and Nrf2 (a pro-survival protein activated in response to ER stress) in MI rats treated with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of P38? and P38? compared to the MI alone. As a cumulative effect, this inhibitor treatment also resulted in significant increase in the levels of caspase3 activity and TUNEL positivity, the end point apoptotic markers. Furthermore, SB203580-treated hypoxic adult cardiomyocytes showed formation of desmin aggregates which were previously associated with impaired cardiac function. Thus, this study shows for the first time the precise mechanism by which P38 MAPK plays a pro-survival role and confers protection of cardiomyocytes, during infarct formation.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Animal
