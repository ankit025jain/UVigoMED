{"id":82343,"title":"[Disorders of the stomatognathic system in patients with short stature].","abstract":"Growth hormone (GH) is a polypeptide hormone produced by the cells of pituitary. Production of growth hormone is carried out in a pulsating manner, and the frequency and intensity of the pulses is dependent on age and gender. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is characterized by, among others, slow growth process often from early childhood, delayed bone age. The aim of the study was to describe dental problems of children with short stature with a special attention on disorders at the craniofacial region such as decreased growth of maxilla and mandible, gnathic and bite dysfunctions, delayed teeth eruption, tooth caries susceptibility. Growth hormone treatment undertaken at the right time significantly influences on correct development of cranial bones and dentition, and supports orthodontic treatment.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645583","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Growth hormone treatment","weight":0.657184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_treatment"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.65602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.594783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.558028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.511358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Short stature","weight":0.446629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stature"},{"name":"Growth hormone deficiency","weight":0.37934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_deficiency"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.302114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Bone age","weight":0.295618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_age"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.252428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pulse (legume)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(legume)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Horse teeth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_teeth"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Tooth eruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_eruption"}]}
