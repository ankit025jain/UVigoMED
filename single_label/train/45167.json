{"id":45167,"title":"Odds ratio for 2 Ã— 2 tables: Mantel-Haenszel estimator, profile likelihood, and presence of surrogate responses.","abstract":"Use of surrogate outcome to improve the inference in biomedical problems is an area of growing interest. Here, we consider a setup where both the true and surrogate endpoints are binary and we observe all the surrogate endpoints along with a few true endpoints. In a two-treatment setup we study the surrogate-augmented Mantel-Haenszel estimator based on observations from different groups when the group effect is present. We compare the Mantel-Haenszel estimator with the one obtained by maximizing profile likelihood in a surrogate augmented setup. We observe that the performances of these estimators are very close.
