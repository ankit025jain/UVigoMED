{"id":23094,"title":"[Survey of macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Beijing, China].","abstract":"To explore the tendency of macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients in Beijing.Adult CAP patients of ? 18 yrs were enrolled in 3 medical centers in Beijing , China. Throat swab samples were taken from all the patients to perform the culture of M. pneumoniae . All the isolated M. pneumoniae strains were subjected to susceptibility evaluation for 6 agents, including macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin. In strains showing macrolide resistance, the 23S rRNA gene was analyzed.A total 53 strains of M. pneumoniae were isolated from 321 enrolled patients. Thirty-eight of the isolated strains (71.7%) were resistant to erythromycin and 32 of them (60.4%) were resistant to azithromycin. Six strains with moderate or low level of erythromycin-resistance were still susceptible to azithromycin. No fluoroquinolone-resistant or tetracycline-resistant strains were observed in our study. Point transition of A2063G in the 23S ribosomal RNA gene was the main reason for the high prevalence of macrolide resistance.The prevalence of macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae is very high in adult CAP patients in Beijing. Studies are needed to clarify the clinical meaning of prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in adults CAP patients.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503430","annotations":[{"name":"Erythromycin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythromycin"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae","weight":0.824325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Macrolide","weight":0.801907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"},{"name":"Azithromycin","weight":0.792817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.675385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.624413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.592738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"23S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.485089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"China","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.268037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"2060s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060s"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Talent agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
