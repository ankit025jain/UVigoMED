{"id":81677,"title":"Impact of aesthetic restorative treatment on anterior teeth with fluorosis among residents of an endemic area in Brazil: intervention study.","abstract":"Endemic dental fluorosis has already been described in some regions of the world. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional and psychosocial impact of direct aesthetic restorative treatments in endemic fluorosis patients in the northern state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Was a quasi-experimental intervention study.The reference population consisted of individuals between 9 and 27 years of age that were served by a project intended to recover the smiles of patients with severe fluorosis. The questionnaires were administered on two occasions, 24 months apart (before and after dental treatment). Initially, descriptive analyses were conducted. Prevalence and severity, as well as the extent of the functional and psychosocial impact of oral disorders were estimated based on the Oral Health Impact Profile instrument (OHIP-14). Comparisons between baseline and follow-up and between treatment techniques were carried out using the McNemar, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney tests.The study involved 53 individuals, with a mean age of 15.9 years, treated with microabrasion, dental composite, or a combination of both techniques. The treatments performed proved to be competent for reducing the functional and psychosocial impact of oral disorders as measured by the OHIP-14, pointing to the possibility of establishing protocols to be used in programs aimed at restoring the aesthetics and functionality of the anterior teeth in large populations.After performing the direct aesthetic restorative treatments in patients with endemic fluorosis, a significant improvement was observed in the prevalence and severity, as well as the extent of the functional and psychosocial impact of oral disorders.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886223","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.618581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.544226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dental fluorosis","weight":0.470148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.379087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Dental composite","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_composite"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.303993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.260748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.191115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.147466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Abrasion (dental)","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(dental)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Minas Gerais","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais"},{"name":"Ontario Health Insurance Plan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Health_Insurance_Plan"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Northern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_United_States"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Minas, Uruguay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas,_Uruguay"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"}]}
