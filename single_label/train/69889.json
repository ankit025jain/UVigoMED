{"id":69889,"title":"Preclinical and clinical evidence of activity of pazopanib in solitary fibrous tumour.","abstract":"To explore the activity of pazopanib in solitary fibrous tumour (SFT).In a preclinical study, we compared the activity of pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, regorafenib, axitinib and bevacizumab in a dedifferentiated-SFT (DSFT) xenotransplanted into Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Antiangiogenics were administered at their reported optimal doses when mean tumour volume (TV) was 80 mm(3). Drug activity was assessed as TV inhibition percentage (TVI%). From May 2012, six consecutive patients with advanced SFT received pazopanib, on a national name-based programme. In one case sunitinib was administered after pazopanib failure.In the xenograft model, pazopanib showed the lowest antitumour activity (21%TVI), while regorafenib was the most active (95%TVI). Sorafenib, bevacizumab, sunitinib were markedly active (78/70/65%TVI). Axitinib was marginally active (51%TVI). In the retrospective case-series, three patients carried malignant-SFT (MSFT), three DSFT. Best Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumour (RECIST) responses were: three stable disease (SD), all MSFT, three progressive disease (PD), all DSFT, corresponding to one partial response (PR), two SD, three PD by Choi criteria. Median-progression-free survival was 3 months (range 1-15). In one patient, sunitinib was started after pazopanib failure, with a response.In dedifferentiated-SFT xenograft pazopanib induced a marginal antitumour activity, while regorafenib appeared the most active and promising agent. When administered in patients, pazopanib showed a modest activity in terms of tumour growth stabilisation, observed only in non-dedifferentiated cases.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269954","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.885975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.515674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Severe combined immunodeficiency","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_combined_immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Axitinib","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axitinib"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.310822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Sunitinib","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunitinib"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.208635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Pazopanib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazopanib"},{"name":"SCID mice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCID_mice"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Microsoft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"},{"name":"TVI (Portugal)","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVI_(Portugal)"}]}
