{"id":13365,"title":"Two novel myxosporean species (Myxosporea: Bivalvulida), Myxobolus marumotoi n. sp. and Cardimyxobolus japonensis n. sp., from the dark sleeper, Odontobutis obscura, in Japan.","abstract":"Two new myxosporean species, Myxobolus marumotoi n. sp. and Cardimyxobolus japonensis n. sp. (Myxozoa: Myxosporea: Bivalvulida), are described from the dark sleeper, Odontobutis obscura, in Japan, based on their morphological and molecular characterizations. Plasmodia of M. marumotoi n. sp. (Myxobolidae) grew in the myofiber of trunk muscles, forming pseudocysts. The rounded spore was relatively large, measuring 13.3-15.0 ?m (average 13.8) in length, 14.2-15.0 ?m (14.6) in width, and 10.0-11.7 ?m (10.8) in thickness, with two subspherical polar capsules of 7.9-9.6 ?m (8.4) in length by 5.4-6.3 ?m (5.9) in width (n = 15). The polar capsules were directed toward the apex of the spore, packing five to six spirals of the polar filament. Plasmodia of C. japonensis n. sp. (Ortholineidae) were surrounded by thin fibrous tissue, forming cysts in the lamina propria of the alimentary tract. The spore was ovoid, wider than long, in valvular view and spindle-shaped in sutural view. It measured 8.8-10.4 ?m (9.4) in length, 11.3-12.5 ?m (11.9) in width, and 5.2-6.7 ?m (5.8) in thickness, with two ovoid polar capsules of 4.2-5.0 ?m (4.7) in length by 2.9-3.8 ?m (3.3) in width (n = 15). The shell valves of spores often showed a flattened anterior border and semicircular posterior border, and the two polar capsules were directed toward opposite lateral sides. In addition, the sporoplasm contained an iodinophilous vacuole. Almost complete small-subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences, except for primer flanking regions, were obtained for both species; 1,996 bp long for the former and 1,588 bp long for the latter. On phylogenetic trees based on the SSU rDNA sequences of representative species of Bivalvulida, M. marumotoi n. sp. and C. japonensis n. sp. formed a distinct branch in the Henneguya/Myxobolus clade or near but outside this clade, respectively. This study is the first report of the genetic characterization for the genus Cardimyxobolus.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Animal
