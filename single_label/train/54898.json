{"id":54898,"title":"Nine years of retained perfluoro-n-octane in the anterior chamber after retinal detachment repair with no signs of ocular toxicity.","abstract":"Perfluoro-n-octane (PFO) is commonly used in vitreoretinal surgery. In this case report, we present a 35-year-old patient with retained PFO up to 9 years after par plana vitrectomy. Post-operatively, PFO bubbles occupied 15% of the anterior chamber (AC). Follow-up over 9 years, consistently showed a quiet AC, normal intraocular pressure and endothelial cell counts remained stable. Until date, the patient has been under observation and there have been no ocular symptoms or side-effects. Residual PFO that inadvertently remains in the AC can be well- tolerated, without side-effects for up to 9 years.
