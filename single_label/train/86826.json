{"id":86826,"title":"[Genetic characterization of the Wad Medani virus (WMV) (Reoviridae, Orbivirus), isolated from the ticks Hyalomma asiaticum Schulze et Schlottke, 1930 (Ixodidae: Hyalomminae) in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Armenia and from the ticks H. anatolicum Koch, ","abstract":"Near full-genome sequence of the Wad Medani Virus (WMV) (strain LEIV-8066Tur) (Orbivirus, Reoviridae) isolated from the ticks Hyalomma asiaticum Schulze et Schlottke, 1929, collected from sheep in Baharly district in Turkmenistan, was determined using next generation sequencing approach. The similarity of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (Pol, VP1) amino acid sequence between WMV and the Kemerovo group orbiviruses (KEMV), as well as of the Baku virus (BAKV), was 64%. The similarity of the conserved structural protein VP3 (T2) of WMV with mosquito-borne and tick-borne orbiviruses reaches 46% and 67%, respectively. For the surface proteins VP2, VP5, and VP7 (T13), which have major antigenic determinants of orbiviruses, the similarity of WMV with tickborne orbiviruses (KEMV and BAKV) is 26-30%, 45% and, 57%,
