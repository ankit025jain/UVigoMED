{"id":68592,"title":"Treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis with faropenem for 3 days versus 7 days: multicentre, randomized, open-label, controlled trial.","abstract":"The increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria such as fluoroquinolone-resistant or extended-spectrum ?-lactamase-producing strains in pathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis has been of concern in Japan. Faropenem sodium is a penem antimicrobial that demonstrates a wide antimicrobial spectrum against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. It is stable against a number of ?-lactamases.We compared 3 and 7 day administration regimens of faropenem in a multicentre, randomized, open-label, controlled study.In total, 200 female patients with cystitis were enrolled and randomized into 3 day (N?=?97) or 7 day (N?=?103) treatment groups. At the first visit, 161 bacterial strains were isolated from 154 participants, and Escherichia coli accounted for 73.9% (119/161) of bacterial strains. At 5-9 days after the completion of treatment, 73 and 81 patients from the 3 day and 7 day groups, respectively, were evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis; the microbiological efficacies were 58.9% eradication (43/73), 20.5% persistence (15/73) and 8.2% replaced (6/73), and 66.7% eradication (54/81), 6.2% persistence (5/81) and 7.4% replaced (6/81), respectively (P?=?0.048). The clinical efficacies were 76.7% (56/73) and 80.2% (65/81), respectively (P?=?0.695). Adverse events due to faropenem were reported in 9.5% of participants (19/200), and the most common adverse event was diarrhoea.The 7 day regimen showed a superior rate of microbiological response. E. coli strains were in general susceptible to faropenem, including fluoroquinolone- and cephalosporin-resistant strains.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508899","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.81126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.758867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.716871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.689777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.629353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.602659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.601747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.428679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Cystitis","weight":0.137394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystitis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0312962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
