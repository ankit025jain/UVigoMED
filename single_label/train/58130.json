{"id":58130,"title":"Isolated torsion of fallopian tube complicating pregnancy: case report.","abstract":"Isolated fallopian tube torsion is a very uncommon condition in pregnancy. Most of the cases presented were in the third trimester. Only one case was reported in labor. The authors report the second case of the isolated tubal torsion during labor.A 18-year-old primigravid woman at 37 weeks of gestation was admitted to labor room with painful uterine contraction. Cervix was one-cm dilated and 70% effaced. Her sonographic and laboratory findings were unremarkable. Approximately four hours later the patient reported sudden pain at lower abdomen. The fetal heart rate tracing showed late deceleration. Preoperative diagnosis was considered as ablatio placenta. Isolated torsion of the right fallopian tube was revealed in cesarean delivery. Healthy infant was delivered and right salpingectomy was performed. Postoperative course was uncomplicated.In case of pain unrelated to uterine contraction during labor may be a sign of fallopian tube torsion which is an uncommon condition complicating pregnancy. In such condition, fallopian tube torsion should be kept in mind since early diagnosis may help to preserve the affected tube during labor.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992798","annotations":[{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Salpingectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salpingectomy"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.867861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.833344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Uterine contraction","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_contraction"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cardiotocography","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotocography"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Testicular torsion","weight":0.331422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_torsion"},{"name":"Third trimester","weight":0.295631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_trimester"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.295073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
