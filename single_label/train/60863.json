{"id":60863,"title":"Methotrexate-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders presenting in the skin: A clinicopathologic and immunophenotypical study of 10 cases.","abstract":"Methotrexate (MTX)-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (B-LPD) may first present in the skin, but their clinicopathologic features are still ill defined. Differentiation from primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCLBCL-LT) is important, as MTX-associated B-LPD may show spontaneous regression after withdrawal of MTX therapy. In the present study, the clinicopathologic and phenotypical features of 10 patients with MTX-associated B-LPD first presenting in the skin, including 5 EBV(+) and 5 EBV(-) cases, were investigated. Six patients had skin-limited disease. Clinically, abrogation of MTX therapy resulted in a complete response in 4 cases and a partial response in another 2. The 5-year disease-specific survival was 90%. MTX-associated B-LPD differed from primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma by the presence of ulcerating and/or generalized skin lesions, an infiltrate composed of centroblasts/immunoblasts rather than large centrocytes, reduced staining for CD79a, and expression of BCL2, IRF4, and FOXP1 in most cases. EBV(+) MTX-associated B-LPD differed from PCLBCL-LT by the presence ulcerative skin lesions, marked tumor cell polymorphism, reduced staining for CD79a, and expression of CD30 and EBV. EBV(-) cases showed morphologic and immunophenotypical similarities to PCLBCL-LT but differed by presentation with generalized skin lesions in 4 of 5 cases. The results of this study, showing a relatively good clinical outcome and spontaneous disease regression after only withdrawal of MTX in a considerable proportion of patients, underscores the importance of a careful wait-and-see policy before considering more aggressive therapies in patients with MTX-associated B-LPD of the skin.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24805861","annotations":[{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.90179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.810658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.708277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.620072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.560168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.532491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.195315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"CD30","weight":0.117191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD30"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Bachelor of Civil Law","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law"},{"name":"CD79","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD79"},{"name":"IRF4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRF4"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.0283835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Interferon regulatory factors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_regulatory_factors"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
