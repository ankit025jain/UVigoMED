{"id":53030,"title":"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: a 25-year single-institution experience.","abstract":"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is among the most aggressive solid tumors accounting for 1-5 % of primary thyroid malignancies. In this retrospective review, we aim to evaluate the prognostic factors, treatment approaches, and outcomes of patients with ATC treated at a single institution.We retrospectively identified 95 patients with ATC from an institutional database between 1985 and 2010. A total of 83 patients with sufficient records were included in this study. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were recorded. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, and factors predictive of outcome were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis.Of the 83 patients, 41 were male and 42 were female. The median age at presentation was 60 years (range 28-89 years) with a median survival of 8 months. The 1- and 2-year DSS were 33 and 23 %, respectively. On univariate analysis, age less than 60 years, clinically N0 neck, absence of clinical extrathyroidal extension (cETE), gross total resection, and multimodality treatment were statistically significant predictors of improved survival. On multivariate analysis, absence of cETE, multimodality therapy, and gross total resection were predictors of improved outcome.In patients with locoregional limited disease, multimodality treatment with gross total surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy offers the best local control and DSS.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24554064","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.609861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anaplasia","weight":0.527349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasia"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.50668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.375332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_Therapeutic_Chemical_Classification_System"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
