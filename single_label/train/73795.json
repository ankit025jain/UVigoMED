{"id":73795,"title":"Wellbeing among sub-Saharan African patients with advanced HIV and/or cancer: an international multicentred comparison study of two outcome measures.","abstract":"Despite the high mortality rates of HIV and cancer in sub-Saharan Africa, there are few outcome tools and no comparative data across conditions. This study aimed to measure multidimensional wellbeing among advanced HIV and/or cancer patients in three African countries, and determine the relationship between two validated outcome measures.Cross-sectional self-reported data from palliative care populations in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa using FACIT-G+Pal and POS measures.Among 461 participants across all countries, subscale \"social and family wellbeing\" had highest (best) score. Significant country effect showed lower (worse) scores for Uganda on 3 FACIT G subscales: Physical, Social + family, and functional. In multiple regression, country and functional status accounted for 21% variance in FACIT-Pal. Worsening functional status was associated with poorer POS score. Kenyans had worse POS score, followed by Uganda and South Africa. Matrix of correlational coefficients revealed moderate correlation between the POS and FACIT-Pal core scale (0.60), the FACIT-G and POS (0.64), and FACIT-G?+?Pal with POS (0.66).The data reveal best status for family and social wellbeing, which may reflect the sample being from less individualistic societies. The tools appear to measure different constructs of wellbeing in palliative care, and reveal different levels of wellbeing between countries. Those with poorest physical function require greatest palliative and supportive care, and this does not appear to differ according to diagnosis.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885695","annotations":[{"name":"Uganda","weight":0.811299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda"},{"name":"Kenya","weight":0.800454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.715908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.658788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.64678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.556281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.483986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.476225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.42607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.231976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Individualism","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"The Matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Facit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facit"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Point of sale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Comparative sociology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_sociology"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
