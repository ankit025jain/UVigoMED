{"id":90184,"title":"Compressive neuropathies related to ganglions of the wrist and hand.","abstract":"Ganglions of the wrist and hand causing compressive neuropathies are rare clinical entities. Compression of the ulnar and median nerves in their respective fibro-osseous tunnels lead to characteristic patterns of motor and/or sensory deficits, which are directly related to the location of the lesion. We present a unique case of a \"dumbbell\" shaped ganglion invading both Guyon's canal and the carpal tunnel causing a dual compressive neuropathy of the ulnar and median nerve. We discuss the patho-anatomy, clinical assessment, investigation and surgical treatment of this condition.
