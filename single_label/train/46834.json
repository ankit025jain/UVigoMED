{"id":46834,"title":"Association of vegetable and fruit intake with gastric cancer risk among Japanese: a pooled analysis of four cohort studies.","abstract":"Prospective evidence is inconsistent regarding the association between vegetable/fruit intake and the risk of gastric cancer.In an analysis of original data from four population-based prospective cohort studies encompassing 191 232 participants, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of gastric cancer incidence according to vegetable and fruit intake and conducted a meta-analysis of HRs derived from each study.During 2 094 428 person-years of follow-up, 2995 gastric cancer cases were identified. After adjustment for potential confounders, we found a marginally significant decrease in gastric cancer risk in relation to total vegetable intake but not total fruit intake: the multivariate-adjusted HR (95% CI; P for trend) for the highest versus the lowest quintile of total vegetable intake was 0.89 (0.77-1.03; P for trend = 0.13) among men and 0.83 (0.67-1.03; P for trend = 0.40) among women. For distal gastric cancer, the multivariate HR for the highest quintile of total vegetable intake was 0.78 (0.63-0.97; P for trend = 0.02) among men.This pooled analysis of data from large prospective studies in Japan suggests that vegetable intake reduces gastric cancer risk, especially the risk of distal gastric cancer among men.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618149","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.57031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.411965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.28735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.254857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.241807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.17051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Home run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"},{"name":"771","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/771"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"428","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/428"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
