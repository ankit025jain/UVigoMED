Furthermore, increased LIF expression was observed in the endometrium of women with idiopathic RPL compared with controls.An increased mRNA expression of PROK1 and LIF could be one of the several abnormalities characterizing the endometrium in women with RPL.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25128195","annotations":[{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.737578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.607814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.600162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.55342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.507251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Leukemia inhibitory factor","weight":0.382246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia_inhibitory_factor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.112707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Habitual abortion","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_abortion"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
