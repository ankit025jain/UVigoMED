{"id":86241,"title":"[Research on correlation between lung and large intestine based on meridian and acupoint palpation in patients with bronchial asthma].","abstract":"To explore correlation between lung and large intestine and the two meridians under pathological condition in the view of meridian theory.Ninety-six cases of bronchial asthma were applied palpation at the running course of 12 regular meridians under the elbow and knees and back-shu points. And abnormal reactions were recorded, the affected meridians and back-shu points were discovered.The abnormal reactions most frequently appeared on the Lung Meridian, followed by the Large Intestine Meridian, the Spleen Meridian, the Liver Meridian, the Stomach Meridian and the Triple Energizer Meridian. And the unusual reaction of the back-shu points most frequently appeared on Feishu (BL 13), and Dachangshu (BL 25) and Pishu (BL 21) followed as the next two.The existence of correlation between the Lung Meridian and the Large Intestine Meridians under pathological condition can be proved through meridian and acupoint palpation on bronchial asthma patients.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796049","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Large intestine","weight":0.792926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.507693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Meridian (Chinese medicine)","weight":0.452574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.330676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.327389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Meridian","weight":0.252898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.124614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Energizer Holdings","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energizer_Holdings"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Meridian (geography)","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Running","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"British Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"}]}
