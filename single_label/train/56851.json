{"id":56851,"title":"Thrombospondin-1 polymorphisms influence risk of corneal allograft rejection.","abstract":"We investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) on the risk of corneal allograft rejection. The TSP-1 is known to be involved in the immune response of the anterior chamber of the eye, activating TGF-?2, promoting peripheral and systemic tolerance, and counteracting the proangiogenic activity of VEGF.Three tagging SNPs spanning the TSP-1 region (rs1478604, A>G; rs2228261, C>T; and rs2228262, A>G) were genotyped. Association with risk of rejection was investigated in a group of 378 corneal transplant recipients with risk factors for allograft rejection. Transplant recipients had completed 3-year follow-up.The TSP-1 rs1478604 A SNP was associated significantly with an increased risk of corneal allograft rejection (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.45; P = 0.04) and there was a trend toward the rs1478604, rs2228261, rs2228262 ACA haplotype increasing risk of rejection.The results suggest that TSP-1 rs1478604 AA homozygotes may be at increased risk of corneal transplant rejection, especially if they carry the ACA haplotype.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618326","annotations":[{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.789135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.754497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.661498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.568837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.557844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.499113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.327561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.285466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Thrombospondin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombospondin"},{"name":"Thrombospondin 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombospondin_1"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"378","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/378"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Aktiengesellschaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tag (metadata)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)"}]}
