{"id":45066,"title":"Chrysin attenuates inflammation by regulating M1/M2 status via activating PPAR?.","abstract":"Chrysin (5,7-di-OH-flavone), a widely distributed natural flavonoid, has been well documented for involving in various biological activities, especially in regulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ? (PPAR?) activity as a modest modulator. However, the exact molecular mechanism is still unrevealed. In the current study, for the first time, we discovered that, chrysin not only significantly attenuated inflammation in high-fat feeding mice, but also alleviated high fat diet-induced hepatic, muscular steatosis in obese mice without altering the body weight. Chrysin decreases the infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue in obese mice. In addition, chrysin was also found to induce an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype and decreases M1 phenotype, both in peritoneal macrophages of obese mice and cultured macrophages in vitro, and thereby, chrysin changed the M1/M2 status. Our data further showed that chrysin regulated the phenotype of macrophages through enhancing the transcriptional activation of PPAR? and the expression of its target genes. Taken together, we conclude that chrysin may serve as an effective modulator of PPAR? during the pathogenesis of inflammation, thereby our findings shed light on the potential therapeutic feature of chrysin in recovering inflammatory diseases via regulating M1/M2 status.
