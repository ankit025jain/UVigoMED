{"id":2563,"title":"[The dependence of lipid peroxidation state and the antioxidant system of the myocardium from the thyroid status during short action of stressors].","abstract":"In experiments at 78 adult white outbred male rats were demonstrated that experimental hypothyroidism (injection of 25 mg/kg merkazolil within 20 days) stimulates, while small doses of L-thyroxine (1.5-3.0 ?g/kg within 28 days) limit the intensification of lipid peroxidation in the myocardium under short exposure to stressors of a different nature: physical (t 4-5 Â°C within 30 minutes), chemical (injection of 25% ethanol at a dose of 3.5 g/kg body weight), and emotional (free swimming of rats in the cage within 30 minutes) by influence on the activity of enzymatic (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione) components of the antioxidant system.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427382","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.840983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.789357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.456997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.4316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.28582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.213827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Human swimming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Inbreeding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding"}]}
