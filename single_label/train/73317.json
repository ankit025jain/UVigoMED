{"id":73317,"title":"Mitotic spindle multipolarity without centrosome amplification.","abstract":"Mitotic spindle bipolarity is essential for faithful segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Multipolar spindles are often seen in human cancers and are usually associated with supernumerary centrosomes that result from centrosome overduplication or cytokinesis failure. A less-understood path to multipolar spindle formation may arise due to loss of spindle pole integrity in response to spindle and/or chromosomal forces. Here we discuss the different routes leading to multipolar spindle formation, focusing on spindle multipolarity without centrosome amplification. We also present the distinct and common features between these pathways and discuss their therapeutic implications.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914434","annotations":[{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.906582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Centrosome","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome"},{"name":"Cytokinesis","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokinesis"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.225947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Multipolar neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipolar_neuron"},{"name":"Phylum","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"Polarity in international relations","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_in_international_relations"},{"name":"Dipole","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole"},{"name":"Supernumerary","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernumerary"}]}
