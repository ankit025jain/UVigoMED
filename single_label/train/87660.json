{"id":87660,"title":"Thymosin ?4 administration enhances fracture healing in mice.","abstract":"Thymosin ?4 (T?4 ) is a regenerative peptide that we hypothesized would promote healing of fractured bone. Mice received a bilateral fibular osteotomy and were given i.p. injections of either T?4 (6?mg/kg) or saline. Calluses from saline- and T?4 -treated mice were analyzed for: (1) biomechanical properties and (2) composition using micro-computed tomography (µCT) and histomorphometry. Biomechanical analysis showed that T?4 -treated calluses had a 41% increase in peak force to failure (p?<?0.01) and were approximately 25% stiffer (p?<?0.05) than saline-treated controls. µCT analysis at 21 days post-fracture showed that the fractional volume of new mineralized tissue and new highly mineralized tissue were respectively 18% and 26% greater in calluses from T?4 -treated mice compared to controls (p?<?0.01; p?<?0.05, respectively). Histomorphometry complemented the µCT data; at 21 days post-fracture, T?4 -treated calluses were almost 23% smaller (p?<?0.05), had nearly 47% less old cortical bone (p?<?0.05) and had a 31% increase in new trabecular bone area/total callus area fraction compared with controls (p?<?0.05). Our finding of enhanced biomechanical properties of fractures in mice treated with T?4 provides novel evidence of the therapeutic potential of this peptide for treating bone fractures.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25042765","annotations":[{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.886001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.795781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Mineralized tissues","weight":0.750636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralized_tissues"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.73526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.695781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.666928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.624116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.515541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Thymosins","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymosins"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biomechanical (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanical_(band)"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Biomineralization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomineralization"},{"name":"T4 (Channel 4)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T4_(Channel_4)"}]}
