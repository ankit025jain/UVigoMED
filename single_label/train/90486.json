{"id":90486,"title":"Prediction of peak oxygen uptake from differentiated ratings of perceived exertion during wheelchair propulsion in trained wheelchair sportspersons.","abstract":"To assess the validity of predicting peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak)) from differentiated ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) obtained during submaximal wheelchair propulsion.Three subgroups of elite male wheelchair athletes [nine tetraplegics (TETRA), nine paraplegics (PARA), eight athletes without spinal cord injury (NON-SCI)] performed an incremental speed exercise test followed by graded exercise to exhaustion (VO(2peak) test). Oxygen uptake (VO?), heart rate (HR) and differentiated RPE (Central RPE(C), Peripheral RPE(P) and Overall RPE(O)) were obtained for each stage. The regression lines for the perceptual ranges 9-15 on the Borg 6-20 scale ratings were performed to predict VO(2peak).There were no significant within-group mean differences between measured VO(2peak) (mean 1.50 ± 0.39, 2.74 ± 0.48, 3.75 ± 0.33 L min(-1) for TETRA, PARA and NON-SCI, respectively) and predicted VO(2peak) determined using HR or differentiated RPEs for any group (P > 0.05). However, the coefficients of variation (CV %) between measured and predicted VO(2peak) using HR showed high variability for all groups (14.3, 15.9 and 9.7%, respectively). The typical error ranged from 0.14 to 0.68 L min(-1) and the CV % between measured and predicted VO(2peak) using differentiated RPE was ?11.1% for TETRA, ?7.5% for PARA and ?20.2% for NON-SCI.Results suggest that differentiated RPE may be used cautiously for TETRA and PARA athletes when predicting VO(2peak) across the perceptual range of 9-15. However, predicting VO(2peak) is not recommended for the NON-SCI athletes due to the large CV %s (16.8, 20.2 and 18.0%; RPE(C), RPE(P) and RPE(O), respectively).","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610244","annotations":[{"name":"Spinal cord
