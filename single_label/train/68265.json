{"id":68265,"title":"Association of renal biochemical parameters with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in a community-based elderly population in China: a cross-sectional study.","abstract":"Relationship of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) with parameters that could provide more information than hemodynamic renal indexes has not been clarified. We aimed to explore the association of comprehensive renal parameters with LVDD in a community-based elderly population.1,166 community residents (aged ? 65 years, 694 females) participating in the Shanghai Heart Health Study with complete data of renal parameters were investigated. Echocardiography was used to evaluate diastolic function with conventional and tissue Doppler imaging techniques. Serum urea, creatinine, urea-to-creatinine ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were analyzed on their associations with LVDD.The prevalence of LVDD increased in proportion to increasing serum urea, urea-to-creatinine ratio and UACR. These three renal parameters were found negatively correlated to peak early (E) to late (A) diastolic velocities ratio (E/A), and positively to left atrial volume index; UACR also positively correlated with E to peak early (E') diastolic mitral annular velocity ratio (E/E'). Serum urea, urea-to-creatinine ratio and UACR correlated with LVDD in logistic univariate regression analysis, and urea-to-creatinine ratio remained independently correlated to LVDD [Odds ratio (OR) 2.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-5.95] after adjustment. Serum urea (OR 1.18, 95%CI 1.03-1.34), creatinine (OR 6.53, 95%CI 1.70- -25.02), eGFR (OR 0.22, 95%CI 0.07-0.65) and UACR (OR 2.15, 95%CI 1.42-3.24) were revealed independent correlates of advanced (moderate and severe) LVDD.Biochemical parameters of renal function were closely linked with LVDD. This finding described new cardio-renal relationship in the elderly population.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital
