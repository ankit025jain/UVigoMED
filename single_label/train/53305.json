{"id":53305,"title":"A review of anti-VEGF agents for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","abstract":"Previous research has implicated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Although many studies reviewed the use of anti-VEGF for diabetic macular oedema, little has been written about the use of anti-VEGF for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). This study is a review of relevant publications dealing with the use of anti-VEGF for the treatment of PDR. The articles were identified through systematic searches of PUBMED and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. At the end of each section, we summarized the level of evidence of the scientific literature. Off-label use of anti-VEGF agents was found to be beneficial in PDR, especially in cases with neovascular glaucoma, persistent vitreous haemorrhage, and before vitrectomy. The disadvantages of the use of anti-VEGF are its short-effect duration, causing tractional retinal detachment in cases with pre-existing pre-retinal fibrosis and endophthalmitis in rare cases. There is no conclusive evidence from large randomized trials regarding the efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment in PDR. However, numerous case series, sound biochemical mechanism of action, and increasing experience with using anti-VEGF drugs can be used to support the ongoing use of this treatment modality in selected patients.
