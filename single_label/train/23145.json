{"id":23145,"title":"The influence of antibiotic treatment on the dynamics of oxidative stress in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.","abstract":"Bacterial infections play an important role in liver cirrhosis complications, being together with variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a major complication of liver cirrhosis, with a significant mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of oxygen free radicals in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis, but the role of oxidative stress in the development of SBP is not very clear yet.This study aims to evaluate the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and its changes after therapy.The study is a prospective case-control, which included 33 patients divided into 3 groups: group I- 10 patients with decompensated cirrhosis and SBP, group II - 17 patients diagnosed with decompensated liver cirrhosis with ascites, and group Ill - 6 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis. The control group consisted of 19 healthy subjects recruited from hospital staff, adapted to patients by age and sex. Malonildyaldehida (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, was dosed in the blood and ascitic fluid of patients by assay thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS).Serum MDA significantly increased in the group with decompensated cirrhosis and SBP compared with the control group. MDA levels in ascitic fluid showed a statistically significant increase in the SBP group compared with patients without SBP. There was a decrease of MDA after 6 months of antibiotic treatment compared with the initial stage, while MDA values increased in the absence of treatment.The study demonstrates the increased oxidative stress markers in the blood and ascitic fluid of cirrhotic patients with SBP, which can be considered a predictor of SBP and also a marker of treatment response.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
