{"id":31671,"title":"Association of a quality improvement program with neonatal outcomes in extremely preterm infants: a prospective cohort study.","abstract":"We previously demonstrated improvement in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and nosocomial infection among preterm infants at 12 neonatal units using the Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ). In the current study, we assessed the association of Canada-wide implementation of EPIQ with mortality and morbidity among preterm infants less than 29 weeks gestational age.This prospective cohort study included 6026 infants admitted to 25 Canadian units between 2008 and 2012 (baseline year, n = 1422; year 1, n = 1611; year 2, n = 1508; year 3, n = 1485). Following a 1-year baseline period and 6 months of training and planning, EPIQ was implemented over 3 years. Our primary outcome was a composite of neonatal mortality and any of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe neurologic injury, severe retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis and nosocomial infection. We compared outcomes for baseline and year 3 using multivariable analyses.In adjusted analyses comparing baseline with year 3, the composite outcome (70% v. 65%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51 to 0.79), severe retinopathy (17% v. 13%; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.79), necrotizing enterocolitis (10% v. 8%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98) and nosocomial infections (32% v. 24%; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82) were significantly reduced. The composite outcome was lower among infants born at 26 to 28 weeks gestation (62% v. 52%; OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78) but not among infants born at less than 26 weeks gestational age (90% v. 88%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.20).EPIQ methodology was generalizable within Canada and was associated with significantly lower likelihood of the composite outcome, severe retinopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis and nosocomial infections. Infants born at 26 to 28 weeks gestational age benefited the most.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135927","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","weight":0.848817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopulmonary_dysplasia"},{"name":"Retinopathy of prematurity","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy_of_prematurity"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.776875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.72649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.635141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.612074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Necrotizing enterocolitis","weight":0.579085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_enterocolitis"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.552292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.516378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.486841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.329271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.296728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.291977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.290373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0957205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Generalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"}]}
