{"id":18318,"title":"Effects of meteorological factors on scrub typhus in a temperate region of China.","abstract":"Scrub typhus is emerging and re-emerging in many areas: climate change may affect its spread. To explore the effects of meteorological factors on scrub typhus, monthly cases of scrub typhus from January 2006 to December 2012 in the Laiwu district of temperate northern China were analysed. We examined the correlations between scrub typhus and meteorological factors (and their delayed effects). We built a time-series adjusted negative binomial model to reflect the relationships between climate variables and scrub typhus cases. The key determinants of scrub typhus transmission were temperature, relative humidity and precipitation. Each 1°C increase in monthly average temperature in the previous 3 months, each 1% increase in monthly relative humidity in the previous 2 months and each 1 mm increase in monthly precipitation in the previous 3 months induced 15·4%, 12·6% and 0·7% increases in the monthly number of cases, respectively. In conclusion, scrub typhus is affected by climate change in temperate regions.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800904","annotations":[{"name":"Temperateness","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperateness"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.744119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Precipitation (meteorology)","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Relative humidity","weight":0.71264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Humidity","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity"},{"name":"Meteorology","weight":0.443414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Typhus","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus"},{"name":"Binomial nomenclature","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0886352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Scrub typhus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrub_typhus"},{"name":"Laiwu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laiwu"},{"name":"Negative binomial distribution","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution"},{"name":"Shrubland","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrubland"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Binomial options pricing model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"List of regions of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_China"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"1C Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1C_Company"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"North China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China"}]}
