{"id":43354,"title":"Using microRNA profiles to predict and evaluate hepatic carcinogenic potential.","abstract":"Novel chemical entities have to be assessed for potential adverse effects in exposed human populations, including increased cancer incidence. The liver is an organ of particular interest for such evaluations, due to its central metabolic and detoxifying functions that render it a frequent target of exogenous carcinogens. In recent years a number of studies have investigated the use of microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers to facilitate the identification, characterization, and mechanistic understanding of chemical hepatocarcinogens. In this review we discuss the main findings of these studies, the potential biological significance of observed miRNA perturbations, and avenues of future research.
