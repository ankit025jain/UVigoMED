{"id":18805,"title":"Pilot study on the antibacterial activity of hydrogen peroxide and silver ions in the hospital environment.","abstract":"Nosocomial environmental contamination plays an important role in the transmission of several health care-associated pathogens. Control of surfaces contamination can reduce the risk of cross-infection in hospitals. The aim of our study is to evaluate the disinfectant effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide and silver ions, against nosocomial multidrug-resistant strains, when it's used directly on surfaces.Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and the same multidrug-resistant clinical isolates were selected to study the effectiveness of the disinfectant used in suspension or on the clean and dirty surface.Regarding the suspension activity test, the hydrogen peroxide and silver ions resulted effective after 5 min for ATCC strains and after 10 min for multidrug-resistant isolates; about the surface activity test, its action resulted after 10 min for ATCC strains and after 15 min for multidrug-resistant isolates. Moreover, it was more effective when used in the absence or in presence of a low concentration of biological materials.In a complex environment such as hospital wards, to have a disinfectant notoriously effective but more easy and quick to use would be an useful solution to treat small surfaces occasionally contaminated by biological materials.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763451","annotations":[{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.774928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.663579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.661523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.571845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.3165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.299608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.211848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
