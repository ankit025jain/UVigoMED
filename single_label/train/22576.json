{"id":22576,"title":"Comparison of FLIXENE™ and standard PTFE arteriovenous graft for early haemodialysis.","abstract":"The purpose is to compare the outcomes of FLIXENE™ arteriovenous graft (AVG) to standard polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) AVG for early haemodialysis.This is a prospective observational study of all AVGs placed over a 40-month period between 2008 and 2011 at our vascular unit. Primary outcome was to examine early cannulation rates for FLIXENE™. Secondary outcomes included patency rates, usability of grafts, complications in particular infections, interventions and death in comparison to standard PTFE grafts.Forty-five FLIXENE™ and 19 standard PTFE AVGs were placed in the study period; 89% of FLIXENE™ grafts were used for dialysis, with 78% cannulated within 3 days. At 18 months, primary patency (FLIXENE™ 34% vs standard PTFE 24%), primary assisted patency (35% vs 36%) and secondary patency rate (51% vs 48%) were not statistically different; 20.2% of FLIXENE™ grafts were infected at 18 months requiring explantation compared with 40.3% of standard PTFE grafts (p=0.14).FLIXENE™ can be cannulated for dialysis within 3 days. It has similar patency and complication rates as other prosthetic grafts in the market. In patients who have no access and require urgent dialysis, FLIXENE™ is a viable option.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531998","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.582717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.467061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.209553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.207942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.199211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.044683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"}]}
