{"id":90466,"title":"A case of commotio cordis treated with therapeutic hypothermia.","abstract":"Therapeutic hypothermia is used as a neuroprotective strategy for patients who have persistent neurologic compromise after return of spontaneous circulation from cardiac arrest. The 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines recommend the use of therapeutic hypothermia in adult cardiac arrest patients when the initial rhythm is ventricular fibrillation. These recommendations are based on primary research in patients with a cardiac cause of their ventricular fibrillation.A 43-year-old male was brought to our emergency department (ED) with commotio cordis. He was struck in the chest with a baseball bat, after which he collapsed at the scene and was pulseless. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after defibrillation by treating paramedics, and the patient remained comatose on arrival to the ED. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and treated with therapeutic hypothermia at target temperature of 32-34Â°C. He was extubated on day 3, and discharged home on day 8 with good neurologic function. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: We report a case of commotio cordis in which the adult patient was treated with therapeutic hypothermia and had a favorable outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of its kind. Evidence for the use of therapeutic hypothermia is incomplete in patients with a traumatic cause of cardiac arrest, such as commotio cordis, despite probable similarities in the pathophysiology of anoxic brain injury. Our case illustrates that there may be benefit from use of therapeutic hypothermia for a broader population than is currently recommended.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and
