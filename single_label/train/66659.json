{"id":66659,"title":"An updated meta-analysis on association between angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism and cancer risk.","abstract":"The Alu repetitive sequence insertion/deletion (I/D, rs4646994) polymorphism in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene may alter cancer susceptibility, but results of current studies are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship between the ACE I/D polymorphism and cancer risk, we performed an updated meta-analysis of all eligible studies. All studies published up to July 2013 concerning the association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and cancer risk were identified by systematically searching PubMed, EMBASE, Wanfang, CNKI, and Cqvip databases. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using the fixed/random-effects model in Review Manager 5.1 and STATA 12.0. A total of 46 case-control studies including 7,025 cases and 34,911 controls were identified and evaluated. Overall, we did not observe a direct association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and general cancer risk (DD + DI vs. II OR = 0.95, 95 %CI = 0.84-1.07, P = 0.40). In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, a significant increased susceptibility of prostate cancer was found for variant homozygotes (DD vs. II + ID OR = 2.15, 95 %CI = 1.01-4.55, P = 0.05). Additionally, no significant association was observed in other subgroup analyses according to ethnicity, control source, sample size and quality control of genotyping. In summary, our results suggested that the ACE I/D polymorphism might not be a common risk factor for overall cancer susceptibility, but might contribute to the susceptibility of prostate cancer. More studies with larger sample sizes are required in the future.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691970","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.785842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.735604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.734268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.436476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.430486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.385791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.286952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Repeated sequence (DNA)","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_sequence_(DNA)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"841","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/841"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Alu element","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alu_element"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Doctor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Wanfang","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanfang"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Discovery Investigations","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Investigations"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"}]}
