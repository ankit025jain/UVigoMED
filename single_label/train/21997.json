{"id":21997,"title":"Reducing the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections in a surgical intensive care unit using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Central Line Bundle.","abstract":"Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality. This study sought to determine whether implementation of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Central Line Bundle would reduce the incidence of CLABSIs.The IHI Central Line Bundle was implemented in a surgical intensive care unit. Patient demographics and the rate of CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter days were compared between the pre- and postintervention groups. Contemporaneous infection rates in an adjacent ICU were measured.Baseline demographics were similar between the pre- and postintervention groups. The rate of CLABSIs per catheter days decreased from 19/3,784 to 3/1,870 after implementation of the IHI Bundle (1.60 vs 5.02 CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter days; rate ratio .32 [.08 to .99, P < .05]). There was no significant change in CLABSIs in the control ICU.Implementation of the IHI Central Line Bundle reduced the incidence of CLABSIs in our SICU by 68%, preventing 12 CLABSIs, 2.5 deaths, and saving $198,600 annually.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576582","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.779944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.771817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.750008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.70545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.692316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.692316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.68777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Central line","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_line"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"784","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/784"},{"name":"870","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/870"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Contemporary history","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_history"},{"name":"IHI Corporation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHI_Corporation"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Real Me (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Me_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)"}]}
