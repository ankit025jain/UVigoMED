{"id":63761,"title":"Chemomobilization with high-dose etoposide and G-CSF results in effective and safe stem cell collection in heavily pretreated lymphoma patients: report from a single institution study and review.","abstract":"The optimal mobilization strategy prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) for patients with lymphoma is yet to be determined. We reviewed our institutional experience using chemomobilization with high-dose (HD) etoposide (1.6 g/m(2) ) and G-CSF (300 ?g/day) in 79 patients with lymphoma. The majority (76%) had received at least two prior regimens of chemotherapy, and 12 (15.2%) patients had previously failed to mobilize following HD cyclophosphamide or DHAP or ICE with G-CSF. HD etoposide and G-CSF chemomobilization resulted in successful collection (>2 × 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg) in 82.3% of patients within a median 2 (1-6) apheresis days. Patients had stem cells collected between days +8 and +15, with a median +12 day. Median total CD34+ cells/kg collected was 5.95 × 10(6) (0.1-36.8). Seventy-one percent of patients yielded >2 × 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg in ?2 d of apheresis and were defined as good mobilizers. While median CD34+ cells/kg collected for good mobilizers was 7.6 × 10(6) , it was 2.6 × 10(6) for poor mobilizers (P < 0.001). This regimen was safe with a low rate of febrile neutropenia (7.6%) and acceptable rates of RBC (40.5%) and platelet transfusions (22.8%). Hematopoietic recovery after auto-SCT was achieved on expected time. Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia occurred in only one patient (1.3%) with in a median follow-up of 16 months after chemomobilization. We conclude that HD etoposide and G-CSF chemomobilization appear to result in effective, tolerable, and safe stem cell collection in the majority of heavily pretreated lymphoma patients.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400988","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Apheresis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheresis"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Autologous stem cell transplantation","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.754445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.596395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.5514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Febrile neutropenia","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_neutropenia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
