{"id":31206,"title":"Hepato-protective potential of methanol extract of leaf of Ziziphus mucronata (ZMLM) against dimethoate toxicity: biochemical and histological approach.","abstract":"The leaves of Ziziphus mucronata are used locally as food and a health drink; the leaf paste can also be used in the treatment of boils. The root of the plant is usually used in the treatment of a wide range of pains.The study was carried out to evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of the methanol leaf extract of Ziziphus mucronata (ZMLM).The extract was prepared by soaking in 70% methanol/water and rotary evaporation. The phenol content of extract was then estimated. Twenty five adult male Sprague dawley rats (aged 21 weeks) were divided into five groups of five rats each and treated as follows; normal control (NC) received distilled water. Dimethoate control (DC) (received 6 mg/kg.bw.day(-1) dimethoate dissolved in distilled water). Experimental Groups (E1) received dimethoate (6mg/kg.bw) + ZMLM (100 mg/kg.bw(-1)); (E2) received dimethoate (6 mg/kg.bw) + ZMLM (200 mg/kg.bw(-1)) and (E3) received dimethoate (6 mg/kg.bw) + ZMLM (300 mg/kg.bw(-1)). In both the cases a normal control and dimethoate control were kept to compare the results. After 90 days, blood was collected and rats were sacrificed to collect the liver tissue for biochemical assays and histological estimations.The results of E1 did not show much change from the normal control group but was significantly different from the dimethoate control group (P? 0.05). The preventive effect which was tested in E2 and E3 proved that the extract could almost retain the normal condition in 90 days time. Histological observations also agreed with the results obtained in biochemical parameters.Ziziphus mucronata methanol leaf extract possesses a preventive effect against dimethoate induced oxidative stress as observed in male albino Sprague Dawley rats.","date":"2014-01-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391226","annotations":[{"name":"Phenol","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol"},{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.701037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Evaporation","weight":0.614865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.604021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.567719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.326967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.154042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Rotary evaporator","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_evaporator"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Boil","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boil"},{"name":"North Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Washington, D.C.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"},{"name":"Elimination reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_reaction"},{"name":"Healthy diet","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet"}]}
