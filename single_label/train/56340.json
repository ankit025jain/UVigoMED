{"id":56340,"title":"Non-topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy for the correction of residual mild refractive errors after ICRS implantation and CXL in keratoconus.","abstract":"To evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of non-topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for the treatment of residual mild refractive errors 6 months after sequential intracorneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation and corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) in stable keratoconus.This retrospective study included 17 eyes of 14 patients with mild to moderate keratoconus. The ICRS implantation and CXL were performed sequentially with a 4-week interval and non-topography-guided PRK was performed at least 6 months after CXL. Data were collected preoperatively and at the 6-month follow-up visits.ICRS implantation and CXL induced a significant decrease in keratometry and refraction and an increase in visual acuity. At the 6-month follow-up after ICRS implantation and CXL, uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity (UDVA and CDVA) significantly improved from 1.17 ± 0.38 and 0.44 ± 0.09 logMAR preoperatively to 0.45 ± 0.11 and 0.17 ± 0.08 logMAR (P = .001) postoperatively, respectively. The mean spherical error decreased from -5.45 ± 1.64 to -2.57 ± 1.15 D (P = .01) and the mean cylinder from 3.86 ± 1.15 to 2.13 ± 1.11 D (P = .01). At the 6-month follow-up after PRK, UDVA significantly improved to 0.18 ± 0.06 logMAR and CDVA was 0.15 ± 0.05 logMAR. The mean spherical error and mean cylinder significantly decreased to -1.10 ± 0.41 D (P = .02) and 0.98 ± 0.37 D (P = .046), respectively. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred.At the 6-month follow-up, non-topography-guided PRK after ICRS implantation and CXL was found to be an effective and safe option for correcting residual refractive error and improving visual acuity in patients with moderate keratoconus.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702578","annotations":[{"name":"Keratometer","weight":0.89221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratometer"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.519518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.297132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"International Celestial Reference System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Celestial_Reference_System"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Photorefractive effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_effect"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Somnambulist (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnambulist_(Angel)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
