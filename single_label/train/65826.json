{"id":65826,"title":"[Urination disorders. Do we know all about them?].","abstract":"The article presents the results of the pilot questionnaire survey of doctors of various specialties, living in some cities in the Southern Federal District, in the diagnosis and treatment of various urination disorders. The survey involved 101 urologists, 33 obstetricians, 37 internists, 35 surgeons, 9 neurologists and 1 infectiologist. Inadequate training of doctors of various specialties regarding the diagnosis and treatment of various disorders of urination of inflammatory and non-inflammatory nature should be noted. Misunderstanding of differential diagnosis of various forms of urinary incontinence and tactics of management of each of them come under notice. Most urologists (95.46%), obstetricians (92.3%), physicians (100%), neurologists (66.6%), and surgeons (88.58%) did not have a thorough knowledge about the symptoms of overactive bladder (OB). Only 63.37 % of the entire group of respondents, and 81% of urologists using conservative therapies, has prescribed M-anticholinergics for the treatment of OB. In the treatment of urgent forms of urinary incontinence, only 64.5% of urologists use M-anticholinergics. Excessive use of M-anticholinergics for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence still persists--38% of urologists. alpha-blockers are the main group of drugs (96.6%) used in medical treatment of LUTS in benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, there is reduced (14.8%) understanding of the need to designate combination therapy with M-cholinergic antagonists when indicated. The issues of therapy of patients with lower urinary tract infections, namely the choice of antibiotics without considering antibiotic sensitivity and antibiotic resistance and knowledge of Russian and national guidelines and recommendations of the European Association of Urology are of particular concern. Curiously enough, there is underestimation of this issue by urologists (23%) compared to obstetricians (45%) and physicians (40.7%). These findings can determine the need for education programs for professionals in different areas of medicine, because patients with urination disorders occur in practice of doctors of various related specialties.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772770","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.709582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.648217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.633069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.629456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.617026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.552305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.405461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.139006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
