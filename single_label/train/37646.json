{"id":37646,"title":"Clinical signs of neurofibromatosis impact on the outcome of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.","abstract":"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are a rare subtype of sarcoma, with a poor outcome. MPNST are regarded as being sporadic or associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Few comparative overall-survival (OS) data in these 2 subsets of MPNST patients exist. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess OS in sporadic and NF1-associated MPNST patients.Fourteen consecutive patients with initial localized as well as initial metastatic MPNST were diagnosed and treated in our department. Patients with sporadic MPNST were assigned to group A and those with NF1-associated MPNST to group B.Eight versus 6 patients were allocated to groups A and B. Primary tumors were located on the extremities in all but 1 patient. Two patients in group A and 4 patients in group B experienced a relapse. Four patients died in each of the 2 groups. Median follow-up was 66.2 and 57.2 months in group A and group B, respectively. Median OS in group A was 46.9 months versus 12.7 months in group B.In this small, single-center study, sporadic-MPNST patients had a longer median OS than those with NF1-associated MPNST.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480823","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis","weight":0.757541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.597067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.495769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor","weight":0.449719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_peripheral_nerve_sheath_tumor"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.358188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.156982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis type I","weight":0.143012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis_type_I"},{"name":"NF1","weight":0.0593812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NF1"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
