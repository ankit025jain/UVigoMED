{"id":89611,"title":"Evaluation of carotid angioplasty and stenting for radiation-induced carotid stenosis.","abstract":"We aimed to evaluate the procedural safety, clinical, and angiographic outcome of carotid angioplasty and stenting for high-grade (?70%) radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RIS) using atherosclerotic stenosis (AS) as a control.In this 6-year prospective nonrandomized study, we compared the carotid angioplasty and stenting outcome of 65 consecutive patients (84 vessels) with RIS with that of a control group of 129 consecutive patients (150 vessels) with AS. Study end points were 30-day periprocedural stroke or death, ipsilateral ischemic stroke, technical success, procedural characteristics, instent restenosis (ISR; ?50%) and symptomatic ISR.The median follow-up was 47.3 months (95% confidence interval, 26.9-61.6). Imaging assessment was available in 74 vessels (RIS) and 120 vessels (AS) in 2 years. Comparing RIS group with AS group, the rates of periprocedural stroke or death were 1.5% (1/65) versus 1.6% (2/129; P=1); ipsilateral ischemic stroke rates were 4.6% (3/65) versus 4.7% (6/129; P=1); the annual risks of ipsilateral ischemic stroke were 1.2% (3 patient/254.7 patient year) versus 1.2% (6 patient/494.2 patient year; P=0.89); technical success rates were both 100%. Stenting of common carotid artery and the use of multiple stents was more common in the RIS group (P=0 in both cases); ISR rates were 25.7% (19/74) versus 4.2% (5/120; P<0.001); symptomatic ISR rates were 6.8% (5/74) versus 0.8% (1/120; P=0.031).The safety, effectiveness, and technical difficulty of carotid angioplasty and stenting for RIS are comparable with that for AS although it is associated with a higher rate of ISR.This trial was not registered as enrollment started in 2006.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699055","annotations":[{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.86265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Restenosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restenosis"},{"name":"Carotid artery stenosis","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_artery_stenosis"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.749218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.483001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.406857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.291487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Procedural programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming"},{"name":"254","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/254"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"961","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/961"},{"name":"1120","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1120"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"IBM 5120","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5120"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"2120s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2120s"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Advocate_v_Sheridan_and_Sheridan"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"}]}
