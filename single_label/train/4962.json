{"id":4962,"title":"[Current evidence based interventions for preventing fall and fall-related hip fracture of the older people].","abstract":"For older people, the consequences of falling include injury, fear of falling, decreased activity, functional deterioration, reduced quality of life, and death. According to reliable systematic reviews and guidelines, exercise programs including balance and strength training, multifactorial interventions, and home safety assessment and modification interventions are effective at reducing the rates of falls and risks of falling among community-dwelling elderly people. Taking vitamin D supplements might be effective for reducing falls in older people who exhibit lower vitamin D levels in the blood. Hip protectors apparently reduce the risk of hip fractures in frail older residents of care facilities. Taking vitamin D with calcium supplements might reduce the risk of hip fractures.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509810","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.855207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.74712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.703714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.567928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.449145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0602196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0387899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Strength training","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Immigration reduction in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_reduction_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"}]}
