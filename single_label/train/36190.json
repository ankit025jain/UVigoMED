{"id":36190,"title":"Routine ultrasound examination at 41 weeks of gestation and risk of post-term severe adverse fetal outcome: a retrospective evaluation of two units, within the same hospital, with different guidelines.","abstract":"To study whether a routine with a routine ultrasound examination (routine scan) at 41 gestational weeks as compared with ultrasound on clinical indication (indicated scan), lowered the risk of severe adverse fetal outcome in post-term period.A retrospective cohort study.Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.Eight years of deliveries, 2002-2009.One of the two delivery units at Karolinska University Hospital used a routine scan at 41 week of gestation and the other unit used an indicated scan. Severe adverse fetal outcome were defined: severe asphyxia, death or cerebral damage. The study was analysed using logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders.Differences in post-term severe adverse fetal outcome.No increased risk of post-term severe adverse fetal outcome was seen at the unit using a routine scan; conversely, a 48% significantly increased risk was seen at the unit using an indicated scan (OR 0.89, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.5-1.5 and OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06-2.1, respectively). Comparing post-term periods, there was no significantly increased risk at the unit using indicated scans (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-3.0). There was a 60% increased prevalence of small-for-gestational age (SGA) newborns in the post-term period at the unit using indicated scans (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), but no differences in operative delivery.A policy to use routine scans at 41 weeks of gestation seems to normalise an increased post-term risk of severe adverse fetal outcome, possible due to increased awareness of SGA and/or oligohydramniosis.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593288","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.573938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.569896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.558497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.551755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.522421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Karolinska Institutet","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolinska_Institutet"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0619954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Stockholm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm"},{"name":"Postterm pregnancy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postterm_pregnancy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Karolinska University Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolinska_University_Hospital"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Audio normalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_normalization"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
