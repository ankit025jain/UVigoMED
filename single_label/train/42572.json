{"id":42572,"title":"Adenocarcinoma of the duodenojejunal flexure presenting as a stricturous lesion.","abstract":"A 50-year-old woman was referred with a colicky upper abdominal pain of 3?months duration. She experienced an increase in pain 2?weeks prior to presentation. This was associated with bilious vomiting about 5-6 times/day with no change in bowel habits. She had no history of any abdominal pathology. A review of systems showed she had a weight loss of 20?kg over a period of 4?months with recent onset of loss of appetite. Physical examination revealed a soft distended upper abdomen with non-radiating pain in the epigastrium. CT of the abdomen showed a heterogeneously enhancing stricturous growth in the proximal part of the jejunum with gross dilation of the stomach and duodenum. She underwent resection and anastomosis of the proximal jejunum. Histopathology revealed the lesion to be an adenocarcinoma.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842346","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Epigastrium","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigastrium"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.741734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.528375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.445466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.209069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Biliary colic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_colic"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Duodenojejunal flexure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenojejunal_flexure"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
