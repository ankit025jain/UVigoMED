{"id":69963,"title":"Knockdown of CETN1 inhibits breast cancer cells proliferation.","abstract":"Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease and identification of the genes and proteins regulating breast carcinogenesis is critical in exploring novel targeted therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the role CETN1 in breast cancer growth and metastasis.CETN1 expression levels were measured in breast tissue samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We selected high CETN1-expressing cell lines from human breast carcinoma cells with metastatic potential. The proliferation of cells was evaluated by MTS assay. Changes in progression of cell division were assessed by cell cycle analysis. Changes in CETN1 levels in breast tumor cells were analysed by Western blot.Our results demonstrated that overexpression of CETN1 occurred mainly in breast cancer cells in which CETN1 expression was low. Knockdown of CETN1 by lentivirus- shRNA significantly inhibited breast cancer cells' proliferation, growth and metastasis.CETN1 is overexpressed in breast cancer tissue and promotes cells'proliferation, tumor growth and metastasis.","date":"2014-09-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261648","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.505612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.49391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Cell cycle analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_analysis"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Phylum","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
