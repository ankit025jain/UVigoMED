{"id":45176,"title":"Fulminant hepatic failure with virtually undetectable serum alkaline phosphatase.","abstract":"Wilson's disease presenting as fulminant hepatic failure is a rare presentation that carries a high morbidity and mortality. We report a young patient who developed fulminant hepatic failure as the initial manifestation of Wilson's disease. Virtually undetectable serum alkaline phosphatase provided the first clue to the diagnosis. Our patient underwent a successful liver transplantation which is the only effective treatment in patients with Wilsonian fulminant hepatic failure. In this report, we discuss laboratory clues to the diagnosis of this form of Wilson's disease. Clinicians should have a high suspicion of Wilson's disease as any delay in diagnosis can be catastrophic.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697127","annotations":[{"name":"Wilson's disease","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.775768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.721977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.62001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.592969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.482072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.31466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"}]}
