{"id":62076,"title":"Association between matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) promoter polymorphisms and the susceptibility to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Egyptians.","abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases capable of extracellular matrix degradation. MMP2 is the key molecule that control invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis, and has been associated with poor prognosis in several tumors. Several epidemiological studies have focused on the associations between MMP2 promoter polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility; however, little is known about their role in hematological malignancies. The present study aimed to investigate the association of MMP2 -735C/T and -1306C/T promoter polymorphisms with B-NHL susceptibility and their clinicopathological characteristics. The study included 100 B-NHL patients and 100 healthy controls. Genotyping of MMP2 -735C/T and MMP2 -1306C/T was done by polymerase chain reaction restricted fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. MMP2 -735C/T heteromutant genotype (CT) was detected in 23 % of patients, and the homomutant genotype (TT) was detected in 7 % of patients. The polymorphic allele, T allele, was associated with susceptibility to B-NHL (OR = 2.8:95 %CI = 1.48-5.28). For MMP2 -1306C/T, the frequencies of the polymorphic variants were 5 % for the heteromutant genotype (CT) and 3 % for the homomutant genotype (TT). The polymorphic allele, T allele, conferred almost fourfold increased risk of B-NHL (OR = 3.8, 95 %CI = 1.05-13.9), and the risk elevated to be almost eight folds when confined to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (OR = 7.9, 95 %CI = 1.67-32.27). MMP2 -735C/T polymorphic genotypes were correlated with advanced clinical stages of the disease (stages III and IV). In conclusion, the study revealed that the variant alleles of MMP2 -735C/T and MMP2 -1306C/T can be considered as molecular risk factors for B-NHL among Egyptians.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627195","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain
