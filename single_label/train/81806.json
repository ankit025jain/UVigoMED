{"id":81806,"title":"Levamisole and low-dose prednisolone in the treatment of   reccurent aphthous stomatitis.","abstract":"Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common oral mucosal disease. However, the available therapies for RAS only relieve symptoms and do not provide a cure.This study assessed the response to treatment with levamisole and low-dose prednisolone drug combination in patients with RAS.Fifty RAS subjects were enrolled in the single-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Study medications were administered thrice daily for 3 consecutive days/week for 3 consecutive weeks. Patients in Group 1 received placebo, Group 2 received levamisole (50 mg) and Group 3 received levamisole (50 mg) and low-dose prednisolone (5 mg). Patients were followed up for 60 days after treatment. Response to treatment was assessed using the following clinical parameters: pain due to ulcers, number of ulcers/episode, size of ulcers, duration of ulcers, and frequency of ulcers (episodes/month).Mannâ€“Whitney U-test.A statistically significant improvement was noted in all parameters except for the size of ulcers in patients treated with levamisole alone and with combination of levamisole and low-dose prednisolone. There was no statistically significant improvement in the placebo group. Both active groups had significantly better improvement when compared to placebo group, while there was no significant difference between the two active groups.Levamisole alone and combination of levamisole and low-dose prednisolone are effective modes of therapy for RAS.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822268","annotations":[{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.813961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Levamisole","weight":0.753631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levamisole"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Stomatitis","weight":0.620804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomatitis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.528154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Aphthous ulcer","weight":0.254798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_ulcer"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.244936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"}]}
