{"id":83810,"title":"Mitotic stability of small supernumerary marker chromosomes depends on their shape and telomeres - a long term in vitro study.","abstract":"Mosaicism is present in more than 50% of the cases with small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) and karyotype 47,XX,+mar/46,XX or 47,XY,+mar/46,XY. Recently we provided first evidence that the mitotic stability of sSMC is dependent on their structure, i.e. their shape. Thus, here we performed a long term in vitro study on 12 selected cell lines from the Else Kr√∂ner-Fresenius-sSMC-cellbank (http://ssmc-tl.com/ekf-cellbank.html) to test mitotic sSMC stability systematically. The obtained results showed that inverted duplicated shaped and also the so-called complex sSMCs (group 1) are by far more stable, than centric-minute- or ring-shaped sSMCs (groups 2). Generally speaking, the percentage of cells with group-1-sSMCs remained stable over 90 days of cell culture, while that of group-2-sSMCs in parts dramatically decreased. In one group-2-cell line the sSMC was even lost completely after 30 days of in vitro culture, in others the sSMC was depleted in up to 40% of the cells. Still the highest rate of sSMC loss was recorded during EBV-transformation. Overall, the major difference between groups 1 and 2 was the number of telomeres per sSMC. In group 1 the sSMCs had \"original\" telomeres at both of their ends; in group 2 the sSMCs had either no, possibly secondary acquired and/or only one original telomere. This absence of protective telomeric sequences in group 2 seems to make sSMC more susceptible for loss during cell division. Still, also a growth advantage of cells without sSMC cannot be neglected entirely.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25245454","annotations":[{"name":"Telomere","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"},{"name":"Mosaic (genetics)","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(genetics)"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"XY sex-determination system","weight":0.860244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.819321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.66182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.612848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.546244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.299693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Supernumerary","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernumerary"}]}
