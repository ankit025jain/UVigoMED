{"id":44457,"title":"A novel cantharidin analog N-benzylcantharidinamide reduces the expression of MMP-9 and invasive potentials of Hep3B via inhibiting cytosolic translocation of HuR.","abstract":"Invasion and metastasis are major causes of malignant tumor-associated mortality. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular events underlying inhibitory effect of N-benzylcantharidinamide, a novel synthetic analog of cantharidin, on matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)-mediated invasion in highly metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. In this investigation, among six analogs of cantharidin, only N-benzylcantharidinamide has the inhibitory action on MMP-9 expression at non-toxic dose. The MMP-9 expression and invasion of Hep3B cells were significantly suppressed by treatment of N-benzylcantharidinamide in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 promoter and nuclear levels of NF-?B and AP-1 as the main transcriptional factors inducing MMP-9 expression were not affected by it although the level of MMP-9 mRNA was reduced by treatment of N-benzylcantharidinamide. Interestingly, the stability of MMP-9 mRNA was significantly reduced by N-benzylcantharidinamide-treatment. In addition, the cytosolic translocation of human antigen R (HuR), which results in the increase of MMP-9 mRNA stability through interaction of HuR with 3'-untranslated region of MMP-9 mRNA, was suppressed by treatment of N-benzylcantharidinamide, in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, it was demonstrated, for the first time, that N-benzylcantharidinamide suppresses MMP-9 expression by reducing HuR-mediated MMP-9 mRNA stability for the inhibition of invasive potential in highly metastatic Hep3B cells.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735540","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.799138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.736922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.684112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.683796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.663387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.565333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.47573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Five prime untranslated region","weight":0.4432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_prime_untranslated_region"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.435087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.318421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"AP-1 transcription factor","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP-1_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0312962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
