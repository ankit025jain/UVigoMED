{"id":39648,"title":"Prognostic impact of mechanical ventilation after liver transplantation: a national database study.","abstract":"The impact of mechanical ventilatory support (MCVS) on mortality and graft loss after liver transplantation (LT) is not well described.Multivariate analysis of a novel database linking national transplant registry and Medicare claims data was used to assess the impact of early MCVS on mortality and graft survival following LTs performed between 2002 and 2008.Among 10,517 LT recipients, 6.9% (n = 726) required postoperative MCVS, 25.6% of whom required less than 96 hours, 24.2% required 96 hours or longer, and 50.1% received an unspecified duration. Significant predictors of prolonged MCVS included older age, female sex, pretransplant dialysis requirement, and ascites. After multivariate adjustment, MCVS of 96 hours or longer was associated with nearly 3 times the adjusted hazard ratio of mortality (2.95, P < .001), while MCVS less than 96 hours was not significantly associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio .88, P = .55).Recognition of LT patients at risk for prolonged MCVS may help to reduce the incidence and consequences of this complication.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25151187","annotations":[{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.701937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.518776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.456203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.350223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"726","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/726"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Government database","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_database"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
