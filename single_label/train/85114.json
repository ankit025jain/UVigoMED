{"id":85114,"title":"Mortality trends and the effects of débridement timing in the management of mediastinitis in the United States, 1998 to 2010.","abstract":"The authors examined the relationship between débridement delay and mortality for mediastinitis patients. The authors also assessed mortality trends for mediastinitis patients between 1998 and 2010.The authors conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study with data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 1998 to 2010. They studied adult patients, 18 years of age or older, who were surgically treated for mediastinitis. They used a logistic regression model adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics to evaluate the association between timing of first operative débridement and in-hospital mortality. Using their logistic model, they calculated the adjusted probability of in-hospital mortality for each year of the study.Results showed that initial débridement after the fourth day of admission increased the odds of in-hospital mortality by 50 percent (odds ratio, 1.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.1). In addition, the adjusted probability of in-hospital mortality for an average patient treated for mediastinitis decreased from 10.6 percent in 1998 to 3.1 percent in 2010.There is a survival advantage from timely initial débridement in mediastinitis patients.Risk, II.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158723","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.870774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.589626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.570054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.118447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0841711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mediastinitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinitis"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Survival of the fittest","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
