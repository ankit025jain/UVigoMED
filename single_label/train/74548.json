{"id":74548,"title":"Depth-based shape-analysis.","abstract":"In this paper we propose a new method for shape analysis based on the depth-ordering of shapes. We use this depth-ordering to non-parametrically define depth with respect to a normal control population. This allows us to quantify differences with respect to \"normality\". We combine this approach with a permutation test allowing it to test for localized shape differences. The method is evaluated on a synthetically generated striatum dataset as well as on a real caudate dataset.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320777","annotations":[{"name":"Permutation","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.259246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Permutation test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_test"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Stopping time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_time"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
