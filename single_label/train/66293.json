{"id":66293,"title":"Trans-scrotal varicocelectomy in adolescents: clinical and surgical outcomes.","abstract":"The gold standard to treat varicocele in adolescents is still under discussion. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of trans-scrotal varicocelectomy and show the results obtained by using local anesthesia in combination with preoperative sedation.Between January 2010 and January 2012, this surgical and anesthesiology procedure was proposed to study patients. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were created. Patients received trans-scrotal varicocelectomy with lymphatic and artery sparing technique under local anesthesia with mild sedation anesthesia. Patients were followed for 6 months after surgery, and complications were recorded.Eighteen patients were treated with this technique. Three patients required additional sedation with propofol. None had recurrence of varicocele, and one patient showed post-operative hydrocele. All patients were discharged within 24h following surgery. Three patients used ibuprofen and paracetamol for two days after surgery.Local anesthesia in the pediatric age group could be used for varicocelectomy with mild sedation anesthesia.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726117","annotations":[{"name":"Ibuprofen","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.868451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.641526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scrotum","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.364373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.33402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.274465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Hydrocele","weight":0.210579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocele"},{"name":"Varicocele","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Social exclusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Procedural sedation and analgesia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_sedation_and_analgesia"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
