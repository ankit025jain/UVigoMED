{"id":21953,"title":"[International cooperation with the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer in Togo].","abstract":"The objectives of this paper are to grasp the current status of an endemic disease, known as Buruli ulcer (BU), in the Republic of Togo and the expansion of international assistance in the field. By adopting the explicit support model, this paper also compares the obtained research results with those of the Republic of Ghana and Benin, to clarify the primary functions played among respective governments, WHO, and NGO. Under the auspices of the WHO Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative (GBUI, 1998-), National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NBUCP) in the Togo was initiated in 1999. However, due to the shortage of national budget and politico-economic instabilities of the nation, the actual implementation of NBUCP proved to be problematic. It was after 2007 that the programme began to move forward with the interventions of NGOs like DAHW and Handicap International. Currently, major players involved in the implementation of the policies provided by the GBUI are WHO, NGOs and the targeted governments. In other words, the organizations involved in BU treatment work together by fulfilling their functions. Unlike the neighboring countries, the Togolese government encountered much difficulty in materializing its national programme. Largely due to the political instability and the severe shortage of national budget, stronger assistances from NGOs were required at various levels of the national health measures from formulating to implementing the programme. As the programmes in Togo and Ghana/Benin expanded over the years, the respective support model revealed to be unique and different. In Ghana and Benin, intimate cooperation among WHO, government and NGOs has been established. In Togo, strengthening of collaboration among the three players is expected.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579456","annotations":[{"name":"Ghana","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana"},{"name":"Togo","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togo"},{"name":"Benin","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.80625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.657002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.498734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"Nation","weight":0.456322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Tropical disease","weight":0.399596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_disease"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.312234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"International","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Buruli ulcer","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buruli_ulcer"},{"name":"Budget","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Internationalism (politics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalism_(politics)"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Boston University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Pornography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neglected diseases","weight":0.0136408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglected_diseases"}]}
