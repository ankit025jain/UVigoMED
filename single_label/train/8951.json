{"id":8951,"title":"Effects of delayed puerarin treatment in long-term neurological outcomes of focal ischemic stroke in rats.","abstract":"The present study aimed at investigate the therapeutic effects of delayed puerarin treatment in neurological outcomes after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats.Male Wistar rats were subjected to MCAO for 120 min followed by reperfusion for 14 days. Puerarin (0, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg, intra-peritoneally) was administered at 24 h after stroke onset and repeated daily for 14 days. Neurological deficits were evaluated at 1, 4, 7, 14 days after stroke. Brain infarct volume and peri-infarct context vessel density were examined at 14 days after stroke.Puerarin significantly improved neurological functions up to 14 days after stroke and decreased the infarct volume with doses of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg compared with saline controls. Puerarin treatment also significantly increased peri-infarct context vessel density at 14 days after stroke.Delayed treatment of puerarin initiated at 24 h after stroke is beneficial with improved long-term neurological outcomes and reduced infarction volume in focal ischemic stroke in rats. Enhanced vascular remodeling by puerarin might at least partially contribute to its beneficial effects.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741185","annotations":[{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.892699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.759206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.695078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.692316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.6473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.619792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.3375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.221945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.207296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Puerarin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerarin"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Suplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Anosognosia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"}]}
