{"id":85126,"title":"Anthropometric methods in evaluation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","abstract":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is mainly expressed by weight loss with especially fat-free mass (FFM) depletion and a low body weight correlates with increased mortality and a poor prognosis. We investigated whether anthropometric body composition equations could be used for evaluation of the body composition in COPD. Thirty clinically stable patients with COPD and 13 healthy age matched control subjects underwent the skinfolds and circumference measurements in addition to body mass index (BMI) calculations. Body fat mass (BFM) and FFM were determined by using anthropometric equations. The percent BFM, predicted from body density either using Siri's or Brozek's equations was determined lower than that of calculated with equations by using BMI, age and gender. The values of BFM and body weight were reduced in patients with FEV1 < % predicted compared to other participants. The FFM values also dropped depending on the severity of COPD. BMI was not statistically different among the participants while FFM index (FFMI) reflected the nutritional status of the disorders. Anthropometric equations easily and cost effectively applied for prediction of % BFM, FFM, and FFMI in patients with COPD. In addition, the FFMI can be possibly used for expressing COPD severity.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144979","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.649401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.535845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.478001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.352436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.208685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0990064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
