{"id":80439,"title":"[Left lumbar subcutenous hydatid cyst disease: a case report].","abstract":"Hydatid cyst disease is endemic in our country. This disease is most commonly detected in the liver and lung, but it can be detected rarely in the soft tissue, muscles and subdermally. In this study, we mentioned a case with subcutaneous hydatid cyst disease without any primary lesion. In this case, a left lumbar subdermal cyst was totally excised and the germinative membrane of the cyst was detected and sent for pathological examination and study resultsreported hydatid cyst disease. The patient was followed up for one year with laboratory and radiological studies. No recurrent hydatid cyst was observed. Turkey is an endemic area for hydatid cyst disease and we should bear this disease in mind as a differential diagnosis in all cystic lesions.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659704","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.644599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.567336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Left-wing politics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"}]}
