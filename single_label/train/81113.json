{"id":81113,"title":"Serologic survey for exposure following fatal Balamuthia mandrillaris infection.","abstract":"Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) from Balamuthia mandrillaris, a free-living ameba, has a case fatality rate exceeding 90% among recognized cases in the USA. In August 2010, a GAE cluster occurred following transplantation of infected organs from a previously healthy landscaper in Tucson, AZ, USA, who died from a suspected stroke. As B. mandrillaris is thought to be transmitted through soil, a serologic survey of landscapers and a comparison group of blood donors in southern Arizona was performed. Three (3.6%) of 83 serum samples from landscapers and 11 (2.5%) of 441 serum samples from blood donors were seropositive (p = 0.47). On multivariable analysis, county of residence was associated with seropositivity, whereas age, sex, and ethnicity were not. Exposure to B. mandrillaris, previously unexamined in North America, appears to be far more common than GAE in Southern Arizona. Risk factors for disease progression and the ameba's geographic range should be examined.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458652","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.641196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.589695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.556969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Arizona","weight":0.506665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Soil","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.443838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Amoeba (genus)","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_(genus)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.276036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Tucson, Arizona","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Landscaping","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscaping"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"2010 Winter Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Amoebic dysentery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_dysentery"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.0147534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"}]}
