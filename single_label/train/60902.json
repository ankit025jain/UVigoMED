{"id":60902,"title":"TNF-? SNP rs1800629 and risk of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: relation to immunophenotype.","abstract":"In the AIEOP-BFM ALL (Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica-Berlin Frankfurt MÃ¼nster acute lymphoblastic leukemia) 2000 protocol, 70% of relapsed patients had favorable prognostic features and fell within less intensive polychemotherapeutic regimens, suggesting the need for better assessing lower risk stratification.A novel two-phase study design selected 614 children to be genotyped for TNF-? SNP rs1800629 (-308G>A). A weighted Cox model was applied to evaluate the SNP effect on hazard of relapse, adjusting for immunophenotype, risk group, age and gender and including interaction terms.Significant interaction was found with immunophenotypes (p = 0.0007, with minor allele genotypes being adverse genetic markers in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and protective ones in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and also with risk protocols (p = 0.0041, with minor allele genotypes as prognostic factor of relapse for standard risk patients [only one T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the subgroup analyzed]).The presence of at least one A allele in TNF-? SNP rs1800629 should suggest a closer monitoring in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia standard risk patients.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798719","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.742024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.425303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.316009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.136987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Frankfurt","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt"},{"name":"Immunophenotyping","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunophenotyping"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/308"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Closer (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0158863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Minor allele frequency","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_allele_frequency"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Minuscule 614","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_614"}]}
