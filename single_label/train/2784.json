{"id":2784,"title":"Physical activity and the 15-year incidence of age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"There is uncertainty in the published literature as to whether physical activity should be advocated for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) prevention. We aimed to assess prospectively the association between physical activity and the 15-year incidence of AMD in older adults.We assessed AMD from retinal photographs. Participants provided details of walking exercise and the performance of moderate or vigorous activities, which were used to calculate metabolic equivalents (METs).After adjusting for age, adults aged ? 75 years in the highest tertile (the most physically active) compared to those in the lowest tertile (least physically active) were 79% less likely to have incident late AMD over the 15 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.05-0.95). However, after further adjusting for sex, body mass index, smoking, fish consumption, and white cell count, this association was no longer statistically significant (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.06-1.28). Significant associations were not found in those aged <75 or with the 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD.Physical activity did not influence the risk of AMD over 15 years in older adults, independent of diet, smoking, white cell count, and body mass index.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Eye
