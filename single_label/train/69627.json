{"id":69627,"title":"[Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a follow-up study of the patients' survival time].","abstract":"To explore the long-term survival and prognosis of prostate cancer patients after treated by androgen deprivation therapy.We conducted a follow-up study of 124 patients with prostate cancer treated by androgen deprivation therapy, and compared the survival times of the patients with different pathological grades and clinical characteristics using Kaplan-Meiers survival curves.The mean survival time of the 124 patients after androgen deprivation therapy was 5. 912 years, with the median survival time of 7.81 years. The patients with bone metastases showed a shorter survival time than those with non-bone metastasis (P = 0.04). Pathological grades and PSA levels were not prognostic factors. No significant differences were found in the mean survival time between those died of prostate cancer (n = 35) and those from other factors (n = 23) (P = 0.50).Bone metastasis is an important prognostic factor in advanced prostate cancer following androgen deprivation therapy, which is more significantly correlated with the survival time of the patients than tumor grades and clinical classification.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432623","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.414333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.393353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.0467017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Androgen deprivation therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_deprivation_therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"912","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/912"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
