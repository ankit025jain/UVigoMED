{"id":91579,"title":"New TASER injuries: lacrimal canaliculus laceration and ethmoid bone fracture.","abstract":"The TASER is a non-lethal conducted electrical weapon intended to incapacitate a person. The growing use of the TASER has resulted in an increased risk of injuries, including those to the face. We report a case of lacrimal canaliculus laceration and ethmoid bone fracture caused by an extra penetration (XP) TASER X26 dart. A 35-year-old was subdued with a TASER head shot; the probe was discharged into the left medial canthus without causing any ocular lesions. A computed tomography scan revealed the probe to be embedded in the left nasolacrimal duct and showed a displaced ethmoid fracture. The barbed dart had sectioned the inferior lacrimal canaliculus without electrifying the lesion. This case expands the knowledge of injuries that may occur as a result of the use of this device and the management of peri-ocular TASER injuries.
