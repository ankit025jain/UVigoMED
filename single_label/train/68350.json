{"id":68350,"title":"Associations between premature ejaculation, lower urinary tract symptoms, and erectile dysfunction in middle-aged Korean policemen.","abstract":"There is controversy concerning the relationship between premature ejaculation (PE) and erectile dysfunction (ED), as well as the scan data regarding the association between PE and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).We performed this study to evaluate the association between PE and ED or LUTS.A total of 2,591 policemen aged 40-59 years who had participated in a health examination were included in this study. PE, LUTS, and ED were evaluated using the premature ejaculatory diagnostic tool (PEDT), the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), and the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire-5 (IIEF), respectively. Spearman's correlation test, the multiple linear regression test, and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between PE and ED or LUTS.Associations between PEDT, IPSS, and IIEF.The middle age of the study group was 49.1 years, and the middle PEDT, IIEF, and IPSS was 7.5, 17.0, and 10.7, respectively. By univariate analysis, PEDT showed a significant correlation with IPSS (r?=?0.310, P?<?0.001) and IIEF (r?=?-0.413, P?<?0.001). After adjusting for age, components of metabolic syndrome, testosterone, and IIEF, PEDT was significantly correlated with IPSS (Beta?=?0.166, P?<?0.001). PEDT was also significantly correlated with IIEF after adjusting for age, components of metabolic syndrome, testosterone, and IPSS (Beta?=?-0.274, P?<?0.001). Additionally, the severity of LUTS or ED was associated with the PE positive ratio (P trend?<?0.001). The odds ratio (OR) for PE also increased with the severity of LUTS or ED after adjusting for potential confounding factors.ED and LUTS were significantly and independently correlated with PE.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528521","annotations":[{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.900934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.74699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.696082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.507568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.419121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Premature ejaculation","weight":0.395833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ejaculation"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.358524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.22583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.173181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.140576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Middle age","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_age"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
