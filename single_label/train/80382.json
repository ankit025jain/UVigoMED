{"id":80382,"title":"Detection of antibodies to Neospora caninum in moose (Alces alces): the first report in Europe.","abstract":"Neospora caninum Dubey, Carpenter, Speer, Topper et Uggla, 1988 is a protozoan parasite originally reported as a major cause of bovine abortions worldwide. It is documented that the parasite is widely spread among non-carnivorous cervids. The purpose of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of N. caninum in moose (Alces alces Linnaeus). Blood samples collected in 2010 and 2012 in the northeastern Poland were tested for antibodies to N. caninum by agglutination test (NAT), a commercial competitive screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Sera that gave a positive result were further investigated by western blot (WB) analysis to verify the presence of antibodies. Antibodies to N. caninum were detected in one of seven moose. The antibody titer was confirmed by NAT (1 : 1 280), cELISA (I = 91%) and ELISA (OD = 0.736). The main immunodominant antigens detected by WB were 120, 70, 55, 35 and 16 kDa proteins. This is the first evidence of N. caninum seropositivity in moose living in a natural environment in Europe.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684051","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Protozoa","weight":0.811578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.800917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.75467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.575603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.57086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Moose","weight":0.546754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.539747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.430739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.408126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Carl Linnaeus","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Neospora caninum","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neospora_caninum"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.174834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.120805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Network address translation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Agglutination (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination_(biology)"},{"name":"Neospora","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neospora"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"1988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988"},{"name":"736","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/736"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States_(U.S._Census_Bureau)"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"The WB Television Network","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB_Television_Network"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
