{"id":78597,"title":"[The effect of aerobic exercise on serum IL-4 and TNF-alpha of patients with allergic rhinitis].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on immune factor IL-4, TNF-alpha in patients with allergic rhinitis, which provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.Thirty-two allergic rhinitis patients were selected and divided into a control group (14 people) and the experimental group (18 people). During the treatment, both groups receive conventional symptomatic treatment. Meanwhile, aerobic exercise therapy is applied to the experimental group for 40 - 60 minutes a day, 3 - 4 days a week. Serum IL-4, TNF-alpha and allergic rhinitis symptoms graded scoring were tested before and after 6 month therapy.After six months of exercise intervention, the 11-4, and TNF-alpha levels of experimental group were significantly lower than the level of control group. The symptoms score is also significantly decreased in experimental group.Aerobic exercise had good therapeutic effect in patients with allergic rhinitis. The mechanism may be that aerobic exercise can reduce the level of IL-4 and TNF-alpha, which can relieve infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620666","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.829017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.681408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.543057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.211962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Cellular respiration","weight":0.157721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Carbon group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"60 Minutes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Theory (mathematical logic)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_(mathematical_logic)"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"}]}
