{"id":30861,"title":"Genetic polymorphisms of proangiogenic factors seem to favor hepatocellular carcinoma development in alcoholic cirrhosis.","abstract":"Angiogenesis has been associated with hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alcohol promotes liver hypoxia, a trigger of angiogenesis. We aimed to evaluate whether the frequency of three polymorphisms in hypoxia-induced factor-1? (HIF-1?), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and KDR (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) genes was higher in alcoholics presenting liver disease (ALD) and ALD patients who developed HCC.Functional HIF-1? 1744C/T, VEGFA 2578C/A, and KDR 1416A/T single-nucleotide polymorphisms were studied in 125 ALD patients and 88 heavy drinkers without liver disease (NLD). ALD patients were followed up to 9 years or until they died; 26 patients developed HCC.ALD patients were older than NLD (56±11 vs. 50±13, P<0.001), but drank less (215±164 vs. 331±293 g/day, P<0.001). No differences were found between HIF-1?, VEGFA, or KDR allelic frequencies or genotypes, isolated or simultaneously, between ALD and NLD. In ALD patients, those who developed HCC had a higher KDR 1416T allele frequency (36 vs. 15%, P=0.004; odds ratio 2.72; 95% confidence interval 1.35-5.46). There was also a progressive increase in genotypes with one or two T alleles in patients who developed HCC: AA 50 vs. 73%, AT 35 vs. 23%, and TT 15 vs. 4% (P=0.009). The simultaneous presence of KDR 1416T and VEGFA 2578A was associated with an increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 3.088; 95% confidence interval 1.20-7.96).Genetic polymorphisms in proangiogenic factors did not associate with the risk of ALD in heavy drinkers. However, KDR and VEFGA polymorphisms may confer an increased risk of HCC in patients with ALD.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445728","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.868612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.849348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.783787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.740861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.663999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.641585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Kinase insert domain receptor","weight":0.56703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase_insert_domain_receptor"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.440595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.438047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.171154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0236065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Adrenoleukodystrophy","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenoleukodystrophy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"}]}
