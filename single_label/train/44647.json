{"id":44647,"title":"[Treatment of esophageal cancer].","abstract":"Treatment of choice for esophageal cancer requires multidisciplinary collaboration and requires careful assessment of the stage of the tumor and the patient's condition. When the cancer has extended or if the patient will not tolerate burdensome treatments, the possibilities of oncological therapies must be evaluated. The ability to eat must be secured and the quality of life optimized by using palliative means. Surgery still plays a central role in striving for curative treatment. Surgical techniques and results have improved, and the five-year life expectancy of patients having undergone surgery is over 40%.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724455","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.563138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.471765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"}]}
