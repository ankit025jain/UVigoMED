{"id":92066,"title":"Vertical ridge augmentation with titanium-reinforced, dense-PTFE membranes and a combination of particulated autogenous bone and anorganic bovine bone-derived mineral: a prospective case series in 19 patients.","abstract":"This prospective case series evaluated the use of a new titanium-reinforced nonresorbable membrane (high-density polytetrafluoroethylene), in combination with a mixture of anorganic bovine bone-derived mineral (ABBM) and autogenous particulated bone, for vertical augmentation of deficient alveolar ridges.A mixture of ABBM and autogenous particulated bone was used for vertical ridge augmentation and covered with a new titanium-reinforced nonresorbable membrane. Ridge measurements were obtained before and after the procedure, complications were recorded, and biopsy specimens were taken for histologic examination.Twenty vertical ridge augmentation procedures were carried out in 19 patients. All treated defect sites exhibited excellent bone formation, with an average bone gain of 5.45 mm (standard deviation 1.93 mm). The healing period was uneventful, and no complications were observed. Eight specimens were examined histologically; on average, autogenous or regenerated bone represented 36.6% of the specimens, ABBM 16.6%, and marrow space 46.8%. No inflammatory responses or foreign-body reactions were noted in the specimens.The treatment of vertically deficient alveolar ridges with guided bone regeneration using a mixture of autogenous bone and ABBM and a new titanium-reinforced nonresorbable membrane can be considered successful.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451870","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.70429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.412929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.256547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.215641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.193939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"5.45x39mm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.45x39mm"},{"name":"Guided bone and tissue regeneration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_bone_and_tissue_regeneration"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Ridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Dental alveolus","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_alveolus"}]}
