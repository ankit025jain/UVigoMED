{"id":44623,"title":"Intra-abdominal venous thrombosis after colectomy in pediatric patients with chronic ulcerative colitis: incidence, treatment, and outcomes.","abstract":"Children with chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism, especially after colectomy procedures. We aim to review our patients with CUC who underwent a colectomy and suffered intra-abdominal thrombosis; moreover we wanted to define thrombotic incidence and outcomesIn this is IRB approved retrospective study, we reviewed our patients who underwent colectomy for CUC from January 1999 to December 2011 for development of intra-abdominal thrombosis.Of 366 patients with CUC who underwent colectomy, 15 (4%) were diagnosed with a venous thromboembolism. All patients presented with acute abdominal pain. The locations of thrombus formation varied: 13 (87%) developed thrombi in the portal vein, 4 (27%) in the splenic vein, 2 (13%) in the superior mesenteric vein, 1 (7%) in the hepatic vein, and 1 (7%) in the hepatic artery. The mean number of post-operative days at diagnosis of thrombus was 38.7 days (range 3-180 days). Fourteen patients (93%) underwent anticoagulation for treatment. The mean number of days of anticoagulant therapy until documented resolution of thrombus on imaging was 96.3 days (range 14-364 days). All thrombi resolved with therapy. There was no mortality during follow-up.Four percent of our pediatric patients with chronic ulcerative colitis who underwent colectomy developed symptomatic intra-abdominal venous thromboembolism. 3 to 6 months of anticoagulant therapy is adequate treatment in almost all patients. Practitioners should have a high index of suspicion for intra-abdominal venous thrombus when these patients complain of abdominal pain postoperatively. Based on our experience, prophylactic anticoagulation should be strongly considered peri-operatively in this population.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726123","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Hepatic vein","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_vein"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.812222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.727568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.726851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.627014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.567506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.371055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Superior mesenteric vein","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_vein"},{"name":"Splenic vein","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenic_vein"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.252662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0947559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Superior mesenteric artery","weight":0.0471077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_artery"},{"name":"Common hepatic artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_hepatic_artery"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
