{"id":3599,"title":"Posttraumatic growth and psychological distress in Chinese  early-stage breast cancer survivors: a longitudinal study.","abstract":"To describe the dynamic changes in posttraumatic growth (PTG) and psychological distress in hospitalized early-stage breast cancer (BC) survivors over a 6-month period.A longitudinal study design was adopted. The PTG inventory (PTGI) and distress management screening measure were used 3 months after diagnosis, then again at 6 and 9 months after diagnosis. For baseline data, 155 BC patients who were receiving chemotherapy were selected from four first-class tertiary hospitals in Beijing from April 2010 to March 2011 using a purposive sampling method. Of these, 120 BC patients completed the follow-up investigation. A repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by least significant difference post-hoc analysis, was used to compare PTG and psychological distress.The total score of the PTGI was 62.72 ± 14.66 in BC survivors at 3 months after diagnosis.There was a weak negative relationship between PTG and psychological distress (r = –0.282, p<0.001).PTG increased and psychological distress decreased from 3 to 9 months after diagnosis. The PTGI scores were 63.24 ± 14.21, 68.26 ± 15.29, and 70.29 ± 16.07 at 3, 6, and 9 months after diagnosis, respectively, with distress thermometer scores of 3.62 ± 1.98, 2.59 ± 2.00, and 2.51 ± 1.00, respectively.At 3 months after diagnosis, BC survivors develop PTG at a low level while they are receiving chemotherapy. PTG showed a weak negative association with psychological distress. The level of PTG shows an increasing tendency, whereas the degree of psychological distress exhibits a downward trend in the 9 months after diagnosis.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485337","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.645807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.57765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.5415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.26683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.169309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0380153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Thermometer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer"},{"name":"120 BC","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120_BC"},{"name":"155 BC","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/155_BC"},{"name":"Nonprobability sampling","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprobability_sampling"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Dynamics (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Purpose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose"},{"name":"Health effects from noise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
