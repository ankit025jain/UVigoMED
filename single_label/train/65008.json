{"id":65008,"title":"Human oocyte-derived sperm chemoattractant is a hydrophobic molecule associated with a carrier protein.","abstract":"To characterize the nature of the human oocyte-derived chemoattractant.Laboratory in vitro study.Academic research institute.Ten healthy sperm donors. Oocyte-conditioned media from women undergoing IVF treatment because of male factor infertility.Sperm samples were processed by the migration-sedimentation technique. Oocyte-conditioned media were collected 2-3 hours after oocyte stripping.Sperm chemotaxis was assayed in a ?-slide chamber according to the direction of swimming relative to that of the chemical gradient.Oocyte-conditioned media treated with proteases did not lose their chemotactic activity; on the contrary, they became more active, with the activity shifted to lower concentrations. When oocyte-conditioned media were subjected to hexane extraction, chemotactic activity was found in both the hydrophobic and aqueous phases. Known mammalian sperm chemoattractants were ruled out as oocyte-derived chemoattractants.Our results suggest that the oocyte-derived chemoattractant is a hydrophobic nonpeptide molecule that, in an oocyte-conditioned medium, is associated with a carrier protein that enables its presence in a hydrophilic environment.","date":"2014-08-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063727","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.903181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.831623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.748311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hydrophile","weight":0.725231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.698681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.696827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.656369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Hydrophobe","weight":0.542297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.532105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.432853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Hexane","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Carrier protein","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_protein"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Research institute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_institute"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"},{"name":"Swimming (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)"},{"name":"Sperm donation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_donation"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Striptease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striptease"},{"name":"Institute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"}]}
