{"id":89366,"title":"Comparing memory and meta-memory abilities between children with acquired brain injury and healthy peers.","abstract":"This study compared visual memory and meta-memory abilities of children with ABI to that of healthy peers. Participants included 16 children (aged 13.55 ± 3.29 years) with moderate or severe ABI and 16 healthy children (aged 12.44 ± 3.24 years) with typical development. Children completed the Contextual Memory Test for Children (CMT-CH). The study group showed significantly lower immediate and delayed recall abilities. While the controls used the context for better memorizing, most of the children with ABI used rehearsals. In both groups better delayed recall correlated with the use of a more efficient strategy. Meta-memory should be an integral part of the assessment for children with ABI. Therapists should enhance child's self-awareness to his/her abilities and encourage the use of strategies (e.g. context) for memorizing in daily life.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726285","annotations":[{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Visual memory","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_memory"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Metamemory","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamemory"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Efficiency (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)"},{"name":"Application binary interface","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Recall (memory)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)"}]}
