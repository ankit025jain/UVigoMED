{"id":21290,"title":"Feasibility of shortening 14-day hybrid therapy while maintaining an excellent Helicobacter pylori eradication rate.","abstract":"The need for new effective Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy has focused efforts on the development and optimization of regimens with excellent eradication rates such as 14-day hybrid therapy. This study evaluated whether the duration of hybrid therapy could be reduced while maintaining a high eradication rate and to examine the effect of antibiotic resistance on outcome.Three separate multicenter pilot studies were carried out concurrently. To reduce selection bias, eligible subjects were randomized to 10-day, 12-day, or 14-day hybrid therapy consisting of esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 gm twice daily for 10, 12, or 14 days plus clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for the final 7 days. The primary outcome was H. pylori eradication per-protocol assessed at least 8 weeks after therapy.A total of 220 subjects were entered. The per-protocol analyses contained 60, 61, 61 subjects in the 10-, 12- and 14-day therapy studies, respectively. The eradication rates, per-protocol, were similar: 95% (95% confidence interval (CI); 89.5-100%) for 10-day, 95.1% (95% CI; 89.7-100%) for 12-day, and 93.4% (95% CI; 87.2-99.7%) for 14-day hybrid therapies. Antibiotic resistance was infrequent; however, all metronidazole or clarithromycin resistances were cured with 12- and 14-day therapies.These results suggest that in regions of moderate to low clarithromycin and/or metronidazole resistance it may be feasible to shorten hybrid therapy to 10 or 12 days. Further study is needed to compare hybrid and concomitant therapy in regions with moderate-to-high clarithromycin and/or metronidazole resistance.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612093","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Metronidazole","weight":0.8214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronidazole"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.633295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.547152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Selection bias","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.339734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Clarithromycin","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarithromycin"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.115812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Esomeprazole","weight":0.110579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esomeprazole"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"IBM 5100","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5100"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Requirements management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 7100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7100"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
