{"id":82109,"title":"Life-quality of orthognathic surgery patients: the search for an integral diagnosis.","abstract":"The decision on whether starting an orthosurgical treatment depends on the negative esthetic, functional and social impact the dentofacial deformity has on the quality of life of each patient. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the importance of assessing the quality of life of these individuals by means of applying specific questionnaires before treatment onset in order to increase the success rate of orthosurgical treatment. These questionnaires assess not only the esthetic factor, but also the functional conditions that may be affected as well as the psychological issues related to self-esteem and sociability, all of which must be assessed in order to enable the development of an individual treatment plan that meets patient's expectations. Thus, a more predictable level of satisfaction can be achieved at treatment completion, not only from a normative standpoint stated by professionals, but also from a subjective standpoint stated by patients. Although not enough comparable data is available in the literature for us to assess the extent of improvements produced by orthosurgical treatment, a few recent reports conducted by different universities around the world reveal a good response from the majority of patients after surgery, demonstrating great satisfaction with regard to esthetic, functional and psychosocial factors. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the current objective of orthodontic treatment associated with orthognathic surgery consists not only in treating the esthetic functional components of dentofacial deformities, but also in considering patients' psychological factor.
