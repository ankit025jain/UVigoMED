{"id":47266,"title":"[Use of antibodies for colorectal cancer chemotherapy].","abstract":"There are several molecular target therapeutic drugs for colorectal cancer which are used in daily medical practice in Japan. One is bevacizumab which is anti-VEGF antibody, and another is cetuximab and panitumumab which are anti-EGFR antibodies. However, there is not a clear conclusion which drugs should be used in each therapeutic line, and many studies are in progress. The results of the direct competitive examination of anti-VEGF antibody and anti-EGFR antibodies have been reported recently. These drugs are under consideration to differentiate the use not only from the characteristic of the drugs, but also from the pathological condition of the tumor. In this report, we will show the latest findings and the use of each drugs.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597358","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Cetuximab","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetuximab"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.754349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.712948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Panitumumab","weight":0.61431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panitumumab"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.554255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.503154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
