{"id":81484,"title":"Oral health and prophylactic-therapeutic needs of children aged 6 years in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"Irrespective of the fact that in developed countries, a reduction of dental caries incidence is observed, it still remains the most common chronic disease affecting children in Poland.In the paper, the results of nationwide epidemiological studies conducted in Poland in 2012 within the framework of the Nationwide Dental Health Monitoring Programme were presented.The children aged 6 years were enrolled into the study. Clinical assessment of oral health status of children was made in accordance with WHO recommendations.The percentage of healthy children aged 6 years, who did not have any signs of dental caries manifested with cavity, tooth filling or tooth loss was only 14.4%. On average, only one tooth per child was filled due to dental caries and four out of five teeth affected by dental caries required invasive treatment. Index of conservative treatment was very low and amounted to 0.23 +/- 0.24.The results demonstrate high caries prevalence and significant prophylactic-therapeutic needs.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25004632","annotations":[{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.892916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.707028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.477973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.300165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.226576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.222407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Dental public health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_public_health"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
