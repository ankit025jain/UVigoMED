{"id":89316,"title":"Free skin flap coverage of the upper extremity.","abstract":"Successful soft tissue reconstruction of the upper extremity must provide stable coverage and restore function to the injured hand. To ensure the best possible outcome after traumatic upper extremity injuries, early radical debridement and early flap coverage that restores all missing tissue components is critical to allow early mobilization. Free flaps provide extraordinary versatility in reconstructing defects of soft tissue, muscle, tendon, and bone.
