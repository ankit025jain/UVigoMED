{"id":86818,"title":"C-Reactive protein levels in children with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.","abstract":"C-reactive protein (CRP) is often used to distinguish bacterial from viral infections. However, the CRP level does have implications, which depend on the clinical scenario and are still under research.To evaluate the distribution of CRP levels in children with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.The electronic database of a tertiary pediatric medical center was searched for all inpatients with a diagnosis of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis without bacterial coinfection. Background and clinical information was collected and CRP levels were analyzed.The study group consisted of 66 patients aged 8 months to 7.1 years who met the study criteria. The average CRP was 7.4 mg/dl (normal 0.5 mg/dl). More than a third of the patients had a level higher than 7 mg/dl.High values of CRP are prevalent in patients with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, similar to adenoviral infections and some bacterial infections.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558699","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.794242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.534454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.243345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.10613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.0700267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.0689601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"High-level programming language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Bibliographic database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliographic_database"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
