{"id":19971,"title":"Strategies to promote adherence to treatment by pulmonary tuberculosis patients: a systematic review.","abstract":"The objective of this study is to review and synthesise the best available research evidence that investigates the effectiveness of strategies to promote adherence to treatment by patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).The search sought to find published and unpublished studies. The search covered articles published from 1990 to 2010 in English and Thai. The database search included Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Science Direct, Current Content Connect, Thai Nursing Research Database, Thai thesis database, Digital Library of Thailand Research Fund, Research of National Research Council of Thailand and Database of Office of Higher Education Commission. Studies were additionally identified from reference lists of all studies retrieved. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials that explored different strategies to promote adherence to TB treatment of patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB and also included quasiexperimental studies. Two of the investigators independently assessed the studies and then extracted and summarised data from eligible studies. Extracted data were entered into Review Manager software and analysed.A total of 7972 newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients participated in 10 randomised controlled trials and eight quasiexperimental studies. The studies reported on the effectiveness of a number of specific interventions to improve adherence to TB treatment among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients. These interventions included directly observed treatment (DOT) coupled with alternative patient supervision options, case management with DOT, short-course directly observed treatment, the intensive triad-model programme and an intervention package aimed at improved counselling and communication, decentralisation of treatment, patient choice of a DOT supporter and reinforcement of supervision activities.This review found evidence of beneficial effects from the DOT with regard to the medication adherence among TB patients in terms of cure rate and success rate. However, no beneficial effect was found from DOT intervention with increasing completion rate. In addition, the combined interventions to improve adherence to tuberculosis treatment included case management with directly observed treatment short-course program, the intensive triad-model programme and intervention package. These interventions should be implemented by healthcare providers and tailored to local contexts and circumstances, wherever appropriate.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
