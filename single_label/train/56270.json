{"id":56270,"title":"Intermediate uveitis in children and young adults: differences in clinical course, associations and visual outcome.","abstract":"Intermediate uveitis (IU) is considered to carry a considerable risk for complications and visual loss. This study compares juvenile and adult onset IU with regard to visual loss and complications.Single-centre retrospective analysis of 110 consecutive children with onset of IU at the age of ?16?years compared with 107 consecutive adult patients (17-35?years). All patients were followed for ?1?year (mean 2.5±2.3?years).Average age at first uveitis diagnosis in children (65 boys; 59%) was 9.7±3.17?years and in adults was 24.3±4.92?years (36 men; 34%; p=0.003). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in both groups was similar at first and last presentation. Compared with initial presentation, BCVA improved in 31% of children and 21% of adults during the follow-up period, while it worsened in 9% and 8.7%, respectively. Lyme disease in children (8%) and multiple sclerosis in adults (17%) were the most frequent systemic associations. Poor visual acuity at first presentation, snowbanks and vitreoretinal traction were associated with a higher risk for poor BCVA at last presentation. In children, cataract formation (OR 7.6; 95% CI 1.7 to 33.8) and macular oedema (13.6; 1.6 to 113.5) and in adults posterior synechiae (7.3; 1.8 to 30.2), cataract formation (19.02; 2.31 to 156.56), macular epiretinal membrane (5.1; 1.02 to 25.28) and retinal detachment (8.4; 1.4 to 51.2) were associated with poor BCVA during follow-up. Uveitis course was not worse if associated systemic disease was present.IU with onset in childhood and early adulthood showed a similar visual course at intermediate follow-up. Associated diseases and complication patterns differed between children and young adults.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Eye
