{"id":11097,"title":"Aberrant resting-state functional connectivity in a genetic rat model of depression.","abstract":"Abnormal intrinsic functional connectivity, measured by resting-state functional MRI, has been reported in major depressive disorder (MDD). Our study is the first to demonstrate hypo- and hyperconnectivity between the hippocampus and cortical, subcortical regions in a genetic animal model of depression, similar to connectivity anomalies found in MDD.
