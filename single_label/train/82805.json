{"id":82805,"title":"[Effect of removable partial dentures restoration on oral health-related quality of life of patients with shortened dental arch].","abstract":"To assess the effect of removable partial dentures (PRD) restoration on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) of subjects with shortened dental arches (SDA) using the Chinese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14).Consecutive patients with shortened dental arches were recruited from the Department of Prosthodontics, Foshan Chancheng Hospital of Stomatology. The Chinese version of OHIP-14 was administered to each subject before treatment and after treatment. The subjective outcomes of removable partial dentures therapy on SDA were collected and the pre- and post-treatment scores of the Chinese version of OHIP-14 were compared.After treatment, significant decrease in patients' total score of OHRQOL [before: 9 (6, 12) ; after: 4 (2.25, 6)] was detected, as well as physical pain subscale, physical disability subscale and handicap subscale; and the score of OHRQOL in function limitation subscale increased [before: 0(0,0); after: 2(1, 2)].The main impacts of shortened dental arch with intact anterior region affecting patients' OHRQOL are physical disability.From a quality-of-life perspective, patients with SDA can perceive benefits from RPD.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513072","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.415274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.38647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"China","weight":0.332313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.305714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Chinese language","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"},{"name":"Physical disability","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0891297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.070898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Ontario Health Insurance Plan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Health_Insurance_Plan"},{"name":"Foshan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foshan"},{"name":"Stomatology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomatology"},{"name":"Dental arches","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_arches"},{"name":"RPD","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPD"},{"name":"Removable partial denture","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removable_partial_denture"},{"name":"Prosthodontics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthodontics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Party of Democratic Action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Democratic_Action"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Party of the Democratic Revolution","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_the_Democratic_Revolution"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
