{"id":55223,"title":"von Willebrand factor in iris vasculature of glaucoma patients.","abstract":"Previous reports have indicated the role of endothelium disturbances, as expressed by von Willebrand factor (vWF) release, in pathophysiology of glaucoma. The objective of this study was to investigate the vWF expression in iris vasculature of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).Immunohistochemistry of vWF expression was performed on cryostat sections of samples collected at the time of peripheral iridectomy and controls collected from dead donors.Twenty-seven Caucasians age 66.6±3.7 with 5.8±3.7-year history of treated PAOG and 10 controls age 62.2±1.92 with no history of glaucoma. The percentage of patients who presented normal and up-regulation of vWF phenotype expression differed statistically between examined and control groups: 48% versus 100% (p=0.035, chi-square test with Yates' correction). Sex, age, glaucoma duration, and visual field quantitative indices had no impact on vWF expression. A significant correlation between mean pre-surgery intraocular pressure and vWF expression was found (Spearman r=0.42, p=0.03).Considering the results, it may be suggested that vWF is actively involved in the pathophysiology of glaucoma.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954072","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.789173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.419364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.288389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.214864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.201834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0850078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0360681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Von Willebrand factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor"},{"name":"Cryostat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryostat"},{"name":"Iridectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridectomy"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Von Willebrand disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_disease"},{"name":"Charles Spearman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spearman"},{"name":"Index (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Yates County, New York","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yates_County,_New_York"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
