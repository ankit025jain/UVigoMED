{"id":35979,"title":"Transvenous Onyx embolization of a subependymal deep arteriovenous malformation with a single drainage vein: technical note.","abstract":"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are uncommon. Treatment options include embolization, radiosurgery and surgery, separately or combined, the final goal being complete occlusion of the malformation. We describe the case of a symptomatic small subependymal AVM with a single deep drainage vein previously treated unsuccessfully by radiosurgery and transarterial embolization. The AVM was successfully embolized transvenously using Onyx, achieving complete occlusion in a single treatment session.
