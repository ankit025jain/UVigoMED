{"id":70548,"title":"Gold drug auranofin could reduce neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglia cytotoxic secretions and primed respiratory burst.","abstract":"Neuroinflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Anti-inflammatory treatments could potentially be used to slow down the progression of these diseases. We studied the anti-neuroinflammatory activity of gold compounds which have been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Non-toxic concentrations of auranofin (0.1-1 ?M) significantly reduced the cytotoxic secretions by primary human microglia and microglia-like THP-1 promonocytic cells. Auranofin inhibited primed NADPH-oxidase dependent respiratory burst and secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? and nitric oxide by monocytic cells. It had a direct neuroprotective effect on SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. Auranofin could have a novel application in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175064","annotations":[{"name":"Microglia","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"},{"name":"Respiratory burst","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_burst"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.886344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.667554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.537547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.226803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"}]}
