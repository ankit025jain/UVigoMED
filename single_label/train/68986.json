{"id":68986,"title":"Challenges and advances in the treatment of AKI.","abstract":"Treating or preventing AKI requires treating or preventing a rise in serum creatinine as well as the immediate and remote clinical consequences associated with AKI. Because a substantial number of patients with AKI progress to ESRD, identifying patients likely to progress and halting progression are important goals for treating AKI. Many therapies for AKI are being developed, including RenalGuard Therapy, which aims to maintain high urine output; ?-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, with anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic activities; alkaline phosphatase, which detoxifies proinflammatory substances; novel, small interfering RNA, directed at p53 activation; THR-184, a peptide agonist of bone morphogenetic proteins; removal of catalytic iron, important in free-radical formation; and cell-based therapies, including mesenchymal stem cells in vivo and renal cell therapy in situ. In this review, we explore what treatment of AKI really means, discuss the emerging therapies, and examine the windows of opportunity for treating AKI. Finally, we provide suggestions for accelerating the pathways toward preventing and treating AKI, such as establishing an AKI network, implementing models of catalytic philanthropy, and directing a small percentage of the Medicare ESRD budget for developing therapies to prevent and treat AKI and halt progression of CKD.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480828","annotations":[{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.872918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.803965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.724129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.327694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.235103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Philanthropy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
