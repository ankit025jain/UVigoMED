{"id":74320,"title":"Acute pediatric stroke-what's the hurry? A case for emergency physician-performed echocardiography.","abstract":"Acute ischemic stroke in a pediatric population is uncommon and has a different etiology from the adult population. We describe a case of acute ischemic stroke for which emergent, physician-sonographerâ€“performed transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) changed his outcome.The patient in this case presented with left-sided hemiparesis,with subsequent CT Angiography (CTA) imaging and follow-on neurosurgical embolectomy for a proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion after which showed early recovery of muscular deficit. The cause ultimately was from an atrialmyxoma that was identified early by emergency physician-performed TTE and led to early resection possibly preventing recurrence of stroke.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856752","annotations":[{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.86469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Hemiparesis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiparesis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Embolectomy","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolectomy"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.716214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.691236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.557647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.526848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.421392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.409082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
