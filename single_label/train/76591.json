{"id":76591,"title":"Revision THA in obese patients is associated with high re-operation rates at short-term follow-up.","abstract":"We performed a retrospective review of 309 consecutive revision THAs from 2005 to 2009. We identified a subgroup of patients with BMI >35 and compared the operative time, rate of complications, ICU admissions, re-admissions, and re-operations to patients with BMI <35 undergoing revision THA. At a mean follow-up of 36.3 months, there was no significant difference in operative time, perioperative complications, or re-admission rate between the two groups. However, a significantly higher rate of re-operation was observed in the obese group (46% vs. 28%, P=0.015). Obese patients were more likely to undergo reoperation for infection (P=0.017). Patients with high BMI contemplating primary THA should be aware of the potential subsequent complications associated with revision surgery should it become necessary.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973001","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.165991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.142444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.140035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
