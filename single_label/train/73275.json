{"id":73275,"title":"[Awareness about medical expenses and certifications of eligibility for limited health insurance payments for chemotherapy among clinicians at the Ehime Cancer Care Network Priority Hospitals (Ehime Cancer Kyoten Hospitals)].","abstract":"The \"Cancer Chemotherapy and its Management\" subcommittee at the Ehime Cancer Care Network Priority Hospitals (Ehime Cancer Kyoten Hospitals)with a focus on medical expenses associated with chemotherapy, surveyed awareness among 98 clinicians regarding certifications of eligibility for Limited Health Insurance Payments during cancer treatment. This committee also lists social and clinical problems encountered at the Ehime Cancer Care Network Priority Hospitals. In our survey, 78% of clinicians were consulted about medical expenses associated with chemotherapy and were actively involved in resolving medical expense problems and resulting correspondences. However, only 38% of clinicians could explain the details of the Japanese guideline on the catastrophic cap and the certifications of eligibility for Limited Health Insurance Payments. This knowledge deficit was more pronounced in younger residents. From our analyses of the awareness about medical expenses among clinicians, we recommend the establishment of the following systems for the management of cancer patients. First, establish a reporting system and early consultation on the catastrophic cap and the certifications of eligibility before initiating cancer treatment. Second, education regarding medical expenses should be mandatory for clinicians, especially for young residents. Third, patients with cancer suffering in the interval of the medical expense and the social system should be relieved with new systems.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917006","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.611415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.598925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.543331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.518004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.108815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Professional certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Third World","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World"},{"name":"Social structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure"}]}
