{"id":1454,"title":"[Apply association rules to analysis adverse drug reactions of shuxuening injection based on spontaneous reporting system data].","abstract":"This research based on the analysis of spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data which the 9 601 case reports of Shuxuening injection adverse drug reactions (ADR) in national adverse drug reaction monitoring center during 2005-2012. Apply to the association rules to analysis of the relationship between Shuxuening injection's ADR and the characteristics of ADR reports were. We found that ADR commonly combination were \"nausea + breath + chills + vomiting\", \"nausea + chills + vomiting + palpitations\", and their confidence level were 100%. The ADR and the case reports information commonly combination were \"itching, and glucose and sodium chloride Injection, and generally ADR report, and normal dosage\", \"palpitation, and glucose and sodium chloride injection, and normal dosage, and new report\", \"chills, and generally ADR report, and normal dosage, and 0.9% sodium chloride injection\", and their confidence level were 100% too. The results showed that patients using Shuxuening injection occurred most of ADRs were systemic damage, skin and its accessories damage, digestive system damage, etc. And most of cases were generally and new reports, and patients with normal dosage. The ADR's occurred had little related with solvent. It is showed that the Shuxuening injection occurred of ADR mainly related to drug composition. So Shuxuening injection used in clinical need to closely observation, and focus on the ADR reaction, and to do a good job of drug risk management.","date":"2014-12-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25532406","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Palpitation","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitation"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.785975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.725665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.597051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.425988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.365507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Chills","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
