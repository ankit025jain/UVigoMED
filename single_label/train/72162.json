{"id":72162,"title":"Conservative surgery vs. duodeneopancreatectomy in primary duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST): a retrospective review of 114 patients from the French sarcoma group (FSG).","abstract":"Duodenal GISTs represent 3-5% of all GISTs with limited understanding of patient outcomes. We conducted a retrospective analysis of primary localized duodenal GISTs.Patients were identified via a survey from 16 FSG centers (n = 105), and a group of 9 patients enrolled in the BFR14 trial. Data were collected from the original database and patient files, in agreement with French legislation.114 patients were included, with a median age of 57. Tumors originated mainly in D2 (33%), or D3 (24%), with a median size of 5 cm. 109 patients had resection of the primary tumor; with a Local Resection (LR, n = 82), a pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD, n = 23), and data were missing for 4 patients. Resections were R0 (n = 87, 79%), R1 (n = 8, 7%), R2 (n = 6). Tumor characteristics were: KIT+ (n = 104), CD34+ (n = 58). Miettinen risk was low (n = 43), and high (n = 52). Imatinib was administered preoperatively (n = 11) and post-operatively (n = 20). With a median follow-up of 36 months (2-250), 98 patients are alive, and 33 relapsed. The 5-year OS and EFS rates are 86.5% and 54.5%. EFS was similar for patients in the LR and the PD groups (P > 0.05). In multivariate analysis, ECOG PS, and CD34 expression are independent prognostic factors on OS. Miettinen risk and spindle cell type are independent predictive factors for relapse.Patients with resected duodenal GIST have a reasonably favorable prognosis. This study favors a preservation of pancreas when there are no anatomical constraints. LR exhibit similar survival and smaller morbidity then PD.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24994075","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.91782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.780738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.746848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Cell
