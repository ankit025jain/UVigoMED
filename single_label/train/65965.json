{"id":65965,"title":"Triage of low-risk prostate cancer patients with PSA levels 10 ng/ml or less: comparison of apparent diffusion coefficient value and transrectal ultrasound-guided target biopsy.","abstract":"The purpose of our study was to identify low-risk prostate cancer on the basis of the D'Amico clinical risk score in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 10 ng/mL or less who had undergone radical prostatectomy by comparing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided target biopsy.In the preliminary study, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and determined the cutoff ADC to identify prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6 or less for 117 patients. In the primary study, we assessed the combination of routine MRI (T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging) plus the cutoff ADC value (\"method A\") to identify low-risk prostate cancer for another 89 patients. Their diagnostic value was compared with that of routine MRI combined with the Gleason score obtained from TRUS-guided target biopsies (\"method B\").The preliminary study showed that a mean ADC of 1.04 Ã— 10(-3) mm(2)/s was the best cutoff. In the primary study, accuracy was statistically higher with method A for each reader (p = 0.041).In patients with PSA levels 10 ng/mL or less, the combination of MRI findings plus the cutoff ADC is significantly more accurate for the identification of low-risk prostate cancer than is the combination of MRI followed by TRUS-guided target biopsy.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758659","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.790996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.656113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.638424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Transrectal ultrasonography","weight":0.581814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrectal_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.513707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.354578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.327476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Brownian motion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0196855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
