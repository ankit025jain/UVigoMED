{"id":54790,"title":"Burden of undetected and untreated glaucoma in the United States.","abstract":"To determine the burden of undetected and untreated glaucoma in the noninstitutionalized population over the age of 40 years in the United States of America (US).Cross-sectional study.setting: US civilian, noninstitutionalized population from the 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 administrations of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that were 40 years old or older with completed retinal photographs, completed interview question regarding prior diagnosis of glaucoma, and a negative response to questions regarding comorbidities. main outcome measures: Prevalence of self-reported glaucoma history; signs of glaucoma damage seen in retinal photographs and perimetry; prevalence of undiagnosed glaucoma; and comparison of demographic factors using odds ratios to identify populations with highest burden of previously undiagnosed glaucoma.The study population included 3850 participants who met the inclusion criteria. The 99.5th percentile of the vertical cup-to-disc ratio was 0.67 and the 99.5th percentile of the vertical cup-to-disc ratio asymmetry between eyes was 0.26. Prevalence of undiagnosed glaucoma was 2.9%, increasing with age to 6.6% of the population over 70 years old. Among those with glaucoma, 78% were previously undiagnosed and untreated. Blacks have roughly 4.4 times (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-6.7; P < .0001) and Hispanics have roughly 2.5 times (95%CI: 1.5-4.3; P = .0012) greater odds of having undiagnosed and untreated glaucoma than non-Hispanic whites.Approximately 2.4 million persons in the US have undetected and untreated glaucoma. Overall, prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed glaucoma is much higher in minorities and the elderly. Among those with definite glaucoma, individuals younger than 60 years of age have a greater proportion of undetected disease.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152501","annotations":[{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.678211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.643743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.490382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.43624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.156982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.139861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Civilian","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.0453442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Perimetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetry"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"The 99","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_99"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Legal burden of proof","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof"},{"name":"GWR 2884 Class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_2884_Class"}]}
