{"id":54821,"title":"The external limiting membrane in early-onset Stargardt disease.","abstract":"To describe pathologic changes of the external limiting membrane (ELM) in young patients with early-onset Stargardt (STGD1) disease.Twenty-six STGD1 patients aged younger than 20 years with confirmed disease-causing adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 4 (ABCA4) alleles and 30 age-matched unaffected individuals were studied. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence (AF), and color fundus photography (CFP) images, as well as full-field electroretinograms were obtained and analyzed for one to four visits in each patient.The ELM in all patients exhibited a distinct thickening that was not observed in unaffected individuals. In addition, accumulations of reflective deposits were noted in the outer nuclear layer in every patient. Four patients exhibited a concave protuberance or bulging of a thickened and hyperreflective ELM band within the fovea containing preserved photoreceptors. Longitudinal SD-OCT data in several patients revealed the persistence of this ELM abnormality over a period of time (1-4 years). Furthermore, the edges of the inner segment ellipsoid band appeared to recede earlier than the ELM band in active lesions.Structural changes seen in the ELM of this cohort may reflect a gliotic response to cellular stress at the photoreceptor level in early-onset STGD1.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139735","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Electroretinography","weight":0.58817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.587905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.468172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.396062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.291093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.269299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Outer nuclear layer","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.0603544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"},{"name":"Ellipsoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid"},{"name":"Autofluorescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofluorescence"},{"name":"Stargardt disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargardt_disease"},{"name":"ABCA4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCA4"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Edge detection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Thickening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening"},{"name":"Autofocus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"American Baseball Coaches Association","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Baseball_Coaches_Association"},{"name":"Structural biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
