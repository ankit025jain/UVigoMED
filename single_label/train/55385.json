{"id":55385,"title":"Choroidal structure in normal eyes and after photodynamic therapy determined by binarization of optical coherence tomographic images.","abstract":"To determine changes in choroidal structure by binarization of optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images.Choroidal images were recorded by enhanced depth imaging OCT. The subfoveal choroidal images were analyzed, and the luminal and interstitial areas were converted to binary images by the Niblack method. The interrater, intrarater, and intersession agreements of the binary images were determined for healthy eyes. In eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the binary images of the choroid before photodynamic therapy (PDT) were compared to those after PDT. The untreated fellow eyes were studied as controls.In healthy eyes, the average ratio of the luminal to choroidal area was 65.4%. The interrater agreement rate was high, with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.985 and 0.988 for the choroid and luminal areas, respectively. The intrarater ICC was 0.996 for the choroid and 0.997 for the luminal areas. The intersession ICC was 0.993 for the choroid and 0.984 for the luminal areas. In eyes with AMD, the subfoveal choroidal area, the luminal area, and the interstitial areas were thinner 6 months after PDT (all P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test). The ratio of the luminal to choroidal area was significantly decreased to 62.8% (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test). The ratio for the fellow eyes was not significantly changed.The Niblack binarization method can be used to analyze the luminal area of choroid in an OCT image with good repeatability and reproducibility. The change in the subfoveal choroidal area after PDT is due mainly to a decrease in the luminal areas.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894395","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.533237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.411835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Repeatability","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatability"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"984","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/984"},{"name":"993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/993"},{"name":"988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/988"},{"name":"985","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/985"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Binary image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_image"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Fellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"USS Niblack (DD-424)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Niblack_(DD-424)"},{"name":"Intersession","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersession"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"}]}
