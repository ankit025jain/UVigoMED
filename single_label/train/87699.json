{"id":87699,"title":"Intraarticular fractures of calcaneus - current concepts of treatment.","abstract":"Fractures of calcaneus are the most common among all tarsal bone fractures. Such injuries are most often produced by large forces, while accompanying soft tissue trauma makes them complicated and difficult to treat. Due to complex structure of the foot and talocalcaneal joint all injuries to this area constitute an important orthopedic problem, as improper treatment or lack thereof leads to gait impairment, particularly with regard to moving on uneven surface. In this work we presented the problem of intraarticular calcaneal fractures with particular consideration paid to methods of its treatment. We also mentioned the problem of complications after conservative and surgical treatment as well as methods of their prevention.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022490","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.737922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Calcaneus","weight":0.367075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.0682051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Subtalar joint","weight":0.0288827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtalar_joint"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
