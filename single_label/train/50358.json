{"id":50358,"title":"Treatment of diabetic foot complications with hyperbaric oxygen therapy: a retrospective experience.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.We performed a retrospective observational study of all patients with diabetic foot ulcers treated at the Institution's hyperbaric chamber between January 2010 and August 2012. Patient data was obtained upon patient hospital visit and prospective clinical record consultation.Twenty-six foot lesions including 13 foot ulcers Wagner grade 2 or greater and 13 amputation stump ulcers were submitted to hyperbaric oxygen therapy between January 2010 and August 2012 in our Institution. Of these, 23 foot lesions completed treatment and complete epithelialization of the primary lesion was achieved in 15 (65%). The mean healing period since the first hyperbaric oxygen therapy session was 16 weeks. Above-ankle amputations were performed in 3 limbs and transmetatarsal amputations in 2 limbs.Hyperbaric oxygen may be associated with ulcer healing in selected diabetic foot ulcers with impaired cicatrization.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796835","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperbaric medicine","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.758945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.725531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.715789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.462371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.352127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.300717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.189483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Diving chamber","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_chamber"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
