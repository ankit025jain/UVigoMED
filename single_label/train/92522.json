{"id":92522,"title":"Modified salicylanilide and 3-phenyl-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazine-2,4(3H)-dione derivatives as novel inhibitors of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.","abstract":"Inhibition of osteoclast formation is a potential strategy to prevent inflammatory bone resorption and to treat bone diseases. In the present work, the purpose was to discover modified salicylanilides and 3-phenyl-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazine-2,4(3H)-dione derivatives as potential antiosteoclastogenic agents. Their inhibitory effects on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis from RAW264.7 cells were evaluated by TRAP stain assay. The most potent compounds, 1d and 5d, suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and TRAP activity dose-dependently. The cytotoxicity assay on RAW264.7 cells suggested that the inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption by these compounds did not result from their cytotoxicity. Moreover, both compounds downregulated RANKL-induced NF-?B and NFATc1 in the nucleus, suppressed the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related marker genes during osteoclastogenesis, and prevented osteoclastic bone resorption but did not impair osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1. Therefore, these modified salicylanilides and 3-phenyl-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazine-2,4(3H)-diones could be potential lead compounds for the development of a new class of antiresorptive agents.
