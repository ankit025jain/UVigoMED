{"id":25916,"title":"Are high coronary risk patients missing out on lipid-lowering drugs in Australia?","abstract":"To examine whether high coronary risk patients in Australia, where use of lipid-lowering drugs (LLD) is very high by international standards, are receiving LLD.Assessment of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme pharmacy payment claim records between January 2006 and May 2013 for a 10% random sample of Australian concession card holders. Co-prescriptions were used as a surrogate for high coronary risk groups - coronary heart disease (CHD): antiplatelet drugs (not including solo aspirin) and anti-anginal drugs; diabetes: all standard drugs; hypertension: all standard drugs (not including solo diuretics).Proportions of patients in high-risk groups not receiving LLD (statins, fibrates or ezetimibe).The database yielded information on 276,212 patients defined as being at high coronary risk (mean age, 66.1 [SD, 14.8] years; 44% male). Of this group, 115,477 patients (42%) had not received any LLD during the study period. For patients in the risk group for CHD in combination with diabetes and hypertension, only 8% (1111/14,257) were not receiving LLD. Across all risk groups, the proportions not receiving LLD were generally highest in those aged ? 81 years and, to a lesser extent, < 41 years, and were lowest in those aged 51-70 years.A large proportion of concession card holders at high coronary risk, especially those in middle age with CHD and multiple risk factors, are being appropriately prescribed LLD in Australia.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164848","annotations":[{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.775701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.762097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.718705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.672418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.644486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Ezetimibe","weight":0.593568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezetimibe"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.581011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme"},{"name":"Antianginal","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antianginal"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.466297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.421364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.40717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.34478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Fibrate","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrate"},{"name":"Middle age","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_age"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"International standard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Solo (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_(music)"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
