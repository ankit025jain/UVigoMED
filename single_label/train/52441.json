{"id":52441,"title":"[Cerebral infarction after ovarian hyperstimulation in the era of thrombolysis].","abstract":"Ischemic stroke is a very rare complication but classic ovarian hyperstimulation. We report the cases of three young women aged 35, 37 and 27 years. All three were victims of ischemic formed by proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery secondary to ovarian hyperstimulation. The first and the third had a proximal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery occlusion and the second of the left middle cerebral artery. The last two have benefited from a patient intravenous thrombolysis. The first patient did not receive thrombolysis because it was out of time. Against by their evolution was different. The first has almost recovered its deficit, the second sequelae quite heavy after craniectomy and the third died despite her craniectomy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602311","annotations":[{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.885804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Cerebral infarction","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction"},{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.80179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.74438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.594102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Decompressive craniectomy","weight":0.496378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompressive_craniectomy"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.470281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.0245813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"}]}
