{"id":59089,"title":"Neonatal and early childhood outcomes following early vs later preterm premature rupture of membranes.","abstract":"Data regarding long-term outcomes of neonates reaching viability following early preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM; <25.0 weeks at rupture) are limited. We hypothesized that babies delivered after early PPROM would have increased rates of major childhood morbidity compared with those with later PPROM (?25.0 weeks at rupture).This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of magnesium sulfate vs placebo for cerebral palsy prevention. Women with singletons and PPROM of 15-32 weeks were included. All women delivered at 24.0 weeks or longer. Those with PPROM less than 25.0 weeks (cases) were compared with women with PPROM at 25.0-31.9 weeks (controls). Composite severe neonatal morbidity (sepsis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, severe necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and/or death) and composite severe childhood morbidity at age 2 years (moderate or severe cerebral palsy and/or Bayley II Infant and Toddler Development scores greater than 2 SD below the mean) were compared.A total of 1531 women (275 early PPROM cases) were included. Demographics were similar between the groups. Cases delivered earlier (26.6 vs 30.1 weeks, P < .001) and had a longer rupture-to-delivery interval (20.0 vs 10.4 days, P < .001). Case neonates had high rates of severe composite neonatal morbidity (75.6% vs 21.8%, P < .001). Children with early PPROM had higher composite severe childhood morbidity (51.6% vs 22.5%, P < .001). Early PPROM remained associated with composite severe childhood morbidity in multivariable models, even when controlling for delivery gestational age and other confounders.Early PPROM is associated with high rates of neonatal morbidity. Early childhood outcomes at age 2 years remain poor compared with those delivered after later PPROM.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858202","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopulmonary_dysplasia"},{"name":"Magnesium sulfate","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate"},{"name":"Intraventricular hemorrhage","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraventricular_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Necrotizing enterocolitis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_enterocolitis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cerebral palsy","weight":0.864161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.763352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.761235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.758572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.753434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.649237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Premature rupture of membranes","weight":0.570743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_rupture_of_membranes"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.448814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Fetal viability","weight":0.305524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.136206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Periventricular leukomalacia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periventricular_leukomalacia"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Rupture of membranes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupture_of_membranes"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Enterocolitis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"}]}
