{"id":4708,"title":"[The results of resonance frequency analysis by dental implantation after bone augmentation for alveolar bone atrophy].","abstract":"The report concerns dental implantation effectiveness in case of jawbone atrophy. Thirty patients were included in the study to reveal resonance frequency analysis rates of intraosseous dental implants by dental implant placement with bone augmentation using the veneer technique of cortico-cancellous blocks and guided bone regeneration (GBR) with biodegradable membranes and pins having poly (dl- lactic acid) base.
