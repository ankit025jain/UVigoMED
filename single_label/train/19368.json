{"id":19368,"title":"High burden of extended-spectrum ?-lactamase-positive Escherichia coli in geriatric patients.","abstract":"Few studies have described how an expanding elderly population influences the burden of antimicrobial resistance in micro-organisms. This study aimed to investigate trends in age-stratified extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL)-positive Escherichia coli metrics in relation to an ageing population. The antimicrobial resistance database of E. coli from a healthcare region in Hong Kong from 2003 to 2012 was retrospectively reviewed. Future trends in age-stratified ESBL metrics were predicted up to 2022. Susceptibility results of clinical E. coli isolates from patients aged 0-74 years (n?=?17?853) and aged ?75 years (n?=?17?047) were analysed. For the period 2003-2012, 23.7?% of the hospital admissions were of patients aged ?75 years. However, approximately half of the annual ESBL-positive E. coli isolates were recovered from patients aged ?75 years, being 55.0?% (233/424) in 2003 and 56.0?% (639/1142) in 2012. During this period of time, the annual prevalence and cumulative incidence of ESBL-positive E. coli in patients aged ?75 years were significantly higher than in patients aged 0-74 years. From 2012-2022, it is predicted that ESBL-positive E. coli prevalence among patients aged 0-74 years and ?75 years would increase from 25.4?% to 50.2?% and from 30.8?% to 70.0?%, respectively. In 2022, the predicted ESBL-positive E. coli cumulative incidence would be 63.7 per 10?000 admissions and 178.7 per 10?000 admissions among patients aged 0-74 years and ?75 years, respectively. In conclusion, a rapidly expanding elderly population would substantially add to the burden of ESBL.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722797","annotations":[{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.738002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.72,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.59665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.373712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.226227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2022","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
