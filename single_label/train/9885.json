{"id":9885,"title":"Bone formation on biomimetic calcium phosphate-coated and zoledronate-immobilized titanium implants in osteoporotic rat tibiae.","abstract":"Coating prostheses with calcium phosphate (CaP) can boost ossification and provide an appropriate vehicle for drug delivery. In this study, CaP coating was performed using a biomimetic method, and zoledronate (ZOL) was incorporated to promote peri-implant bone formation in an osteoporotic environment.Twenty female 8-week-old rats were ovariectomized to induce osteoporosis. Twelve weeks later, the animals were randomly separated into four groups representing different ZOL concentrations in the immersion solution: 0 (control), 8, 80, and 800 ?g/mL. Surface-treated implants were inserted in both tibiae, and the rats were sacrificed 8 weeks after implantation. Specimens were retrieved for histomorphometric and microcomputed tomographic analyses.A thin CaP coating was formed on the surface of the titanium implants, and ZOL was successfully incorporated into the structure of the biomimetic CaP coating. There were significant differences between the groups with regard to bone volume, whereas bone-implant contact comparisons did not yield any significant differences. The microstructural results clearly illustrated the positive effect of ZOL loading on the implants, as compared to the controls.The data suggest that biomimetic CaP coating followed by bisphosphonate immobilization is effective in improving bone quality and preserving bone volume around dental implants; therefore, this technique may be beneficial for osteoporosis patients.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683577","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Zoledronic acid","weight":0.781947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoledronic_acid"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.750636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.724205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.638424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.480655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.37387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Bionics","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.295936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.227465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.140679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.131144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.11376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.061322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Microstructure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstructure"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
