{"id":86612,"title":"Health-related quality of life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in Korea.","abstract":"There are few publications on quality measurement of COPD health state according to the severity level using EQ-5D in Korea. The present study aimed to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of disease severity in Korea.Totally two hundred patients with COPD were consecutively recruited in one tertiary hospital of Korea. Each respondent was asked to fill out the questionnaire through a face-to-face interview after providing informed consent. The questionnaire included general and clinical characteristics as well as the EQ-5D and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). HRQoL was evaluated according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria and severity of breathlessness.The adjusted mean EQ-5D index scores were 0.83, 0.88, 0.81 and 0.60 in stage I, II, III and IV, respectively. The EQ-5D index tended to decrease with GOLD criteria. The adjusted mean EQ-Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores ranged from 65.1 in stage IV to 73.9 in stage I. The CCQ total scores deteriorated with an increasing GOLD stage and severity of breathlessness (all P < 0.001). The correlation between CCQ total score and EQ-5D index was -0.69.Our study shows that HRQoL in COPD measured by EQ-5D and CCQ worsens with the GOLD stage and severity of breathlessness. EQ-5D and CCQ could be useful instruments for an evaluation of HRQoL in COPD patients in Korea.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758364","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.925046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.67551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.658734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.503118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.431881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.300124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.289263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.257115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.180839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Equalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Analog Science Fiction and Fact","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Defendant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"GOLD (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOLD_(TV_channel)"}]}
