Compound R,S-4a was a potent H3R functional antagonist in vivo in the rat dipsogenia model, demonstrated potent wake activity in the rat EEG/EMG model, and enhanced short-term memory in the rat social recognition memory model at doses as low as 0.03-0.3 mg/kg po.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513042","annotations":[{"name":"Inverse agonist","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_agonist"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.810292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.423041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.420442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.360156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.281045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.176948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.131677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cyclopropane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopropane"},{"name":"Histamine H3 receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_H3_receptor"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Po (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_(clothing)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"British Rail Class 201","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_201"},{"name":"Recognition (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_(sociology)"},{"name":"Recognition memory","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_memory"}]}
