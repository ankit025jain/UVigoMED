{"id":80953,"title":"[Surveillance of schistosomiasis endemic situation in Jingzhou City in 2011].","abstract":"To understand the endemic situation of schistosomiasis in monitoring sites of Jingzhou City in 2011.According to the monitoring scheme of the schistosomiasis in Hubei Province, the schistosomiasis endemic situation in human, farm cattle and Oncomelania snails were investigated in 64 monitoring sites of Jingzhou City in 2011 and the results were analyzed statistically.In the 64 monitoring sites, the average schistosome infection rate of residents was 1.48%, and the rate in residents aged 50 years or over was highest. There was no case of acute schistosomiasis infection. There were 170 cases of advanced schistosomiasis. The average infection rate of farm cattle was 1.38%. Among the 3 034.03 hm2 area with snails, the area with schistosome infected snails was 25.65 hm2. The average density of living snails was 0.74 snails/0.1 m2, while the average density of infected snails was 0.000 6 snails/0.1 m2. The infection rate of snails was 0.08%.The endemic situation of schistosomiasis in Jingzhou City in 2011 is relatively stable, but the infection rate of farm cattle is higher. Therefore, the preventive measures still should be enhanced.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490408","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.918902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.683817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.65752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.295866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.140868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Jingzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingzhou"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Hectare","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"}]}
