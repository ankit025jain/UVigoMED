{"id":67275,"title":"Cumulative success rates following mild IVF in unselected infertile patients: a 3-year, single-centre cohort study.","abstract":"A 3-year, retrospective, single-centre cohort study was conducted in a private infertility centre to determine cumulative live birth rates (LBR) per scheduled oocyte retrieval following minimal ovarian stimulation/natural-cycle IVF in unselected infertile patients. A total of 727 consecutive infertile patients were analysed who underwent 2876 (median 4) cycles with scheduled oocyte retrieval from November 2008 to December 2011. Natural-cycle IVF or clomiphene-based minimal ovarian stimulation was coupled with single-embryo transfer and increased use of delayed vitrified-warmed blastocyst transfer. Main outcome measures were crude and expected age-specific cumulative LBR per scheduled oocyte retrieval. Crude cumulative LBR were 65%, 60%, 39%, 15% and 5% in patients aged 26-34, 35-37, 38-40, 41-42 and 43-44 years, respectively. No live births occurred in patients aged ? 45 years. Dropout rates per cycle were 13-25%. Success rates gradually reached a plateau, with few additional live births after six cycles. Most of the expected success rate was reached within 6 months with almost maximal rates within 15 months of the first oocyte retrieval. Acceptable cumulative LBR are reached with an exclusive minimal ovarian stimulation/single-embryo transfer policy especially in patients aged <38 years but also in intermediate aged patients (38-40 years).","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631167","annotations":[{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.595202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Birth rate","weight":0.536523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.499984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.497047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Blastocyst","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.269771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.122756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Transvaginal oocyte retrieval","weight":0.0325574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ovulation induction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Petroleum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"1325","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1325"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Sexual stimulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_stimulation"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Lamin B receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamin_B_receptor"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Ovoviviparity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovoviviparity"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_3"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"}]}
