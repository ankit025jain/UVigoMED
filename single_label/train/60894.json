{"id":60894,"title":"Active idiotypic vaccination versus control immunotherapy for follicular lymphoma.","abstract":"Idiotypes (Ids), the unique portions of tumor immunoglobulins, can serve as targets for passive and active immunotherapies for lymphoma. We performed a multicenter, randomized trial comparing a specific vaccine (MyVax), comprising Id chemically coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) plus granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to a control immunotherapy with KLH plus GM-CSF.Patients with previously untreated advanced-stage follicular lymphoma (FL) received eight cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. Those achieving sustained partial or complete remission (n=287 [44%]) were randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:1 to receive one injection per month for 7 months of MyVax or control immunotherapy. Anti-Id antibody responses (humoral immune responses [IRs]) were measured before each immunization. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included IR and time to subsequent antilymphoma therapy.At a median follow-up of 58 months, no significant difference was observed in either PFS or time to next therapy between the two arms. In the MyVax group (n=195), anti-Id IRs were observed in 41% of patients, with a median PFS of 40 months, significantly exceeding the median PFS observed in patients without such Id-induced IRs and in those receiving control immunotherapy.This trial failed to demonstrate clinical benefit of specific immunotherapy. The subset of vaccinated patients mounting specific anti-Id responses had superior outcomes. Whether this reflects a therapeutic benefit or is a marker for more favorable underlying prognosis requires further study.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799467","annotations":[{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.847778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Keyhole limpet hemocyanin","weight":0.846848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_limpet_hemocyanin"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.764139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.706002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.7035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Hemocyanin","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemocyanin"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Idiotopes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiotopes"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Idiotype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiotype"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
