{"id":50662,"title":"The percentages of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer among polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients presenting with abnormal menstrual pattern.","abstract":"Assess the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer among PCOS patients having abnormal menstrual pattern. Endometrial thickness and other clinical characteristics associated with endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer were also evaluatedWomen with PCOS and abnormal menstrual pattern were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. Endometrial thicknesses were evaluated using transvaginal sonography. Endometrial aspiration was performed with endometrial aspirator and sent for pathology.Out of 52 PCOS patients with abnormal menstrual pattern, nine (17.3%) and one (1.9%) had endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, respectively. There was no significant difference in mean endometrial thickness between those who had abnormal and normal endometrium (8.19 +/- 2.58 mm and 7.76 +/- 4.03 mm, respectively). However BMI and age of patients with abnormal endometrium were significantly higher and older than those with normal endometrium (p = 0.031 and p = 0.009, respectively).Nineteen point two percent (19.2%) of patients with PCOS and abnormal menstrual pattern had endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer Endometrial thickness was not different between those with abnormal and normal endometrium.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24765893","annotations":[{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.890117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Endometrial hyperplasia","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.869774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.741748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.702836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.394691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Aspirator","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirator"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Nursing assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_assessment"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"'Allo 'Allo!
