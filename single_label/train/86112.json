{"id":86112,"title":"[Determination of sentinel lymph node by Tc(99m) in small-cell lung cancer].","abstract":"In the prospective study was aimed to be the actual node staging identified sentinel and mediastinel lymph nodes and mapping in patient with operable non-small cell lung carcinomas.Twelve patients underwent pulmonary resections due to non-small cell bronchial carcinoma in the study were included . Intraoperatively, by injecting Tc99m to peritumoral tissues, average 96 minutes later, radioactivity levels of the tumoral tissue and lymph nodes were measured. All patients were evaluated by bronchoscopy for endobronchial lesions. The patients were scanned for the metastasis of solid organs in order to pre-operative staging.The interlobar lymph node stations as a sentinel lymph nodes were detected in 45% of the patient. Lobes of specific, lymph node stations and skip metastasis detected lymph nodes were identified. Sentinel lymph node was in 77% of patients at the level N1 and in 66%of patients at the level N2. It were at two different stations in 66% of patients and at single-station in 33% of patient . In 1 (11%) of 9 patients identified sentinel lymph node, the metastasis has been reported by the routine histopathological examination.To detection sentinel lymph node, micrometastasis also allows for a more detailed pathological examination. It provides making true node staging in patients and postoperative therapy helps to organize appropriate support with non-small cell lung cancer.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814077","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.898451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Micrometastasis","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometastasis"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.652341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.492673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.483197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Technetium-99m","weight":0.327143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium-99m"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.306255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.260136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
