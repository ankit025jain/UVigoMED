{"id":8143,"title":"Preconditioning with glutamine protects against ischemia/reperfusion-induced hepatic injury in rats with obstructive jaundice.","abstract":"To ascertain whether glutamine (Gln) pretreatment protects rats with obstructive jaundice from hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms.An obstructive jaundice rat model was developed by bile duct ligation. On the first day after the operation, all rats were randomized into two groups and received oral Gln or normal saline (NS) daily for 7 days. Then both groups underwent a 15-min liver ischemia via the Pringle maneuver. Blood samples as well as liver and intestinal tissues were harvested and measured after 1, 6 and 24 h of reperfusion.The results showed that the histological morphology of the liver and intestinal tissues significantly improved in the Gln group after I/R injury compared with the NS group. Serum proteins and enzymes associated with hepatic function also significantly improved in the Gln group. The level of glutathione increased and the levels of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase decreased in the Gln group. The levels of interleukin-1? and tumor necrosis factor-? decreased in the Gln group. Moreover, bcl-2 protein expression was upregulated and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and bax protein expression downregulated in the Gln group; the caspase 3 mRNA level significantly increased in the Gln group.The study demonstrates that preconditioning with Gln significantly improves hepatic structure and function after I/R injury in rats with obstructive jaundice. The protective effect of Gln was mediated by the inhibition of reactive oxygen species and inflammation as well as a reduction in hepatocyte apoptosis.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Animal
