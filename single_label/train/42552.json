{"id":42552,"title":"Prevalence of viral hepatitis in Croatian adult population undergoing routine check-up, 2010-2011.","abstract":"Seroprevalence data on viral hepatitis in the general population vary widely. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses in the general Croatian adult population undergoing routine check-ups. The seroprevalence of anti-HAV, anti-HBc and anti-HCV was 40.5%, 7.0% and 0.9%, respectively. HBsAg was found in 0.7% and anti-HBs antibodies in 24.4% of participants. Gender was not associated with HAV, HBV or HCV seropositivity. HAV and HBV seropositivity increased progressively with age (HAV from 11.7% to 90.4%, p < 0.001; HBV from 1.7% to 15.8%, p < 0.001). Participants from rural areas showed a significantly higher HBV seroprevalence rate than those from urban areas (10.7% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.007). Results of univariate and multiple logistic regression showed that older age was a significant predictor for both HAV and HBV seropositivity while rural place of residence was a significant predictor for HBV seropositivity.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844103","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.774928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.733426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.698873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.694133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.6643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.602239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.409754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.0995594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"General medical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_medical_examination"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Croats","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"}]}
