{"id":81541,"title":"Impact of malocclusion on oral health related quality of life of final year dental students.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between severity of malocclusion, orthodontic treatment need and oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) among final year dental students.Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire (PIDAQ) was used to measure oral health related quality of life impacts associated with dental aesthetics among 99 final year dental students. Dental aesthetics was assessed by the respondents using the Aesthetic Component (AC) scale of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) and the Perception of Occlusion Scale (POS), participants were also evaluated by an investigator using the AC of IOTN and Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI). Bivariate and Multiple linear regression analysis were used to test the relationship of demographic characteristics (age, gender), self and professional evaluation of malocclusion severity and the four PIDAQ subscales. The criterion for statistical significance was set at the 5 per cent level.A distinct gradient in mean PIDAQ subscale scores was observed which differed significantly according to treatment categories determined by occlusal indices (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant associations between the POS and all the PIDAQ subscales, while the professional rating of the AC scale of IOTN, had a significant association only with the dental self-confidence subscale.Perceived psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics is related to severity of malocclusion. The sociodental approach which combines normative and psychosocial perception of occlusion is recommended for routine evaluation of treatment need so that measures of patients' views complement clinical measures.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979962","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.775044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.757598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.380204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.35839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.285564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.165899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.0276285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0193344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Alternating current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current"},{"name":"Detective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective"},{"name":"Index Librorum Prohibitorum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Component video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Point of sale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
