{"id":44053,"title":"Altered frequencies of dendritic cells and IFN-gamma-secreting T cells with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy in acute-on- chronic liver failure.","abstract":"Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a serious hepatic ailment with impaired immunity and poor treatment options resulting high mortality. Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF) mobilizes CD34(+) cells in ACLF patients; however its effect on impaired immune responses remains to be elucidated. To analyse the effect of G-CSF in immune modulation in ACLF.We have analysed the frequencies of circulating and intrahepatic myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid(pDCs) dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells in ACLF patients treated with G-CSF (Group A; n = 23) and placebo (Group B; n = 24) using flow cytometry. IFN-c production was compared in both groups following stimulation of PBMCs with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).In Group A, circulating and intrahepatic mDCs, pDCs (P < 0.04, P < 0.02) and T cells(CD3, CD4 and CD8) increased significantly post-G-CSF treatment in comparison to placebo group. Importantly in Group A, IFN-c-producing CD8 T cells were significantly decreased (P > 0.05) along with decreased serum bilirubin and international normalized ratio (INR). Intrahepatic DCs and IFN-clevel were compared in survivor and non-survivor. Non-survivors from both groups, showed decreased DCs, high IFN-c level and no improvement in clinical parameters including s-bilirubin and INR.G-CSF therapy increased the frequencies of dendritic cells and reduced IFN-c secreting CD8 T cells with improved clinical severity indices. Decreased IFN- c production may contribute to reduced hepatocellular damage in ACLF patients.Our observations support the basis for further use of G-CSF therapy as immune modulator in these patients.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754047","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.850298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate","weight":0.756261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate"},{"name":"Immunostimulant","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostimulant"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.722247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.54678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
