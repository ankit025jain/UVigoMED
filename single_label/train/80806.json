{"id":80806,"title":"The role of antioxidants treatment on the pathogenesis of malarial infections: a review.","abstract":"Oxidative damage is one of the most important pathological consequences of malarial infections. It affects vital organs of the body manifesting in changes such as splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, endothelial and cognitive damages. The currently used antimalarials often leave traces of these damages after therapy, as evident in memory impairment after cerebral malaria. Hence, some research investigations have focused attention on the use of antioxidants, alone or in combination with antimalarials, as a viable therapeutic strategy aimed at alleviating plasmodium-induced oxidative stress and its associated complications. However, the practical application of this approach often yields conflicting outcomes because some antimalarials specifically act via induction of oxidative stress. This article critically reviews most of the studies conducted on the potential role of antioxidant therapy in malarial infections. The most frequently investigated antioxidants are vitamins C and E, N-acetylcystein, folate and desferroxamine. Some of the investigations measured the effects of direct administration of the antioxidants on the plasmodium parasites while others performed an adjunctive therapy with standard antimalarials. The therapeutic application of each of the antioxidants in malaria management depends on the targeted aspect of malarial pathology. It is hoped that this article will provide an informed basis for future research activities on the therapeutic role of antioxidants on malarial pathogenesis.
