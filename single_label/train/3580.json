{"id":3580,"title":"[Giant cutaneous benign fibrous histiocytoma of the breast: successful surgical approach in a young female patient].","abstract":"Morphologically, the benign fibrous histiocytoma is a proliferation of the dermal areas and fibroblasts where the last may have a heterogenic localization in the human body. A number of malignant and benign skin lesions may be interpreted as a possible differential diagnosis. We are presenting a female patient with a tumor formation located under the right breast which, after the performance of an elliptical excision, was verified to be a benign fibrous histiocytoma with a tendency toward xantomatization.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510074","annotations":[{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.703485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.671522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.641531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.566432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.255994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Benign fibrous histiocytoma","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_fibrous_histiocytoma"},{"name":"Ellipse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse"}]}
