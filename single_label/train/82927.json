{"id":82927,"title":"Interdisciplinary treatment of a periodontally compromised adult patient with multiple missing posterior teeth.","abstract":"This article reports the comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment of a 50-year-old periodontally compromised adult patient with multiple missing posterior teeth. After initial periodontal treatment, the maxillary first molars and right central incisor were intruded orthodontically. Miniscrews were used to intrude the maxillary first molars by 3 mm. The mandibular arch was restored with a tooth-supported overdenture. Root coverage of the maxillary right central incisor was performed using Alloderm (Biohorizons, Birmingham, Ala). At the end of the interdisciplinary therapy, the results were esthetically pleasing, with the patient's oral functions restored to the optimum. The emphasis of this report is to highlight the importance of integrating various specialties such as periodontics, orthodontics, endodontics, and restorative dentistry toward a common goal of improving the patient's oral health, function, and esthetics.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485739","annotations":[{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.901267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Endodontics","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.727753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"First pharyngeal arch","weight":0.654808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pharyngeal_arch"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.531504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.331451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Specialty (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Restorative dentistry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_dentistry"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
