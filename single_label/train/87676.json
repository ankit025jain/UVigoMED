{"id":87676,"title":"[Percutaneous screw fixation for the treatment of pelvic fractures under C-arm fluoroscopy].","abstract":"To investigate the applications of percutaneous screw fixation for the treatment of pelvic fractures and its related surgical considerations.From June 2010 to June 2012,19 patients with pelvic fractures were treated with percutaneous hollow screws. There were 13 males and 6 females, with an average age of 41 years (ranged from 22 to 58 years). Fractures were caused by traffic accidents in 11 cases, by falling down from high place in 8 cases. Based on the Tile classification, there were 15 cases of Tile C type and 4 case of Tile B type. The indexes such as screw inserting time, intraoperative blood loss, complications, functional recovery and reduction conditions were observed. Fixation methods included sacroiliac screws, cannulated screw fixation of the pubic ramus and cannulated screw fixation of the pubic symphysis separation.Anatomical reduction achieved in 7 cases, satisfactory reduction 11 cases, and unsatisfactory reduction 1 case. Union time of fracture union ranged from 8 to 12 weeks (mean 10 weeks). Wound infection,ununion of fracture and nerve injuries were not found. According to the Majeed standards, 12 patients obtained an excellent results, 6 good and 1 fair.Percutaneous screw fixation for the treatment of pelvic fractures under fluoroscopy has several advantages such as less trauma, less blood loss, fewer rates of complications, reliable fixation and no blood transfusion, which can reconstruct the stability of the pelvic ring, but it needs adequate preoperative preparation and high requirements for the surgeon.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029847","annotations":[{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.912189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.659771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.598597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Pubis (bone)","weight":0.23704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.132977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Sacroiliac joint","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliac_joint"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Pubic symphysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_symphysis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Rugby union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
