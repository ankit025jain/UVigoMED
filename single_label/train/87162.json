{"id":87162,"title":"Immunoglobulin genes influence the magnitude of humoral immunity to cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B.","abstract":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a risk factor for many human diseases, but among exposed individuals, not everyone is equally likely to develop HCMV-spurred diseases, implying the presence of host genetic factors that might modulate immunity to this virus. Here, we show that antibody responsiveness to HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) is significantly associated with particular immunoglobulin GM (? marker) genotypes. Anti-HCMV gB antibody levels were highest in GM 17/17 homozygotes, intermediate in GM 3/17 heterozygotes, and lowest in GM 3/3 homozygotes (28.2, 19.0, and 8.1 Âµg/mL, respectively; P=.014). These findings provide mechanistic insights in the etiopathogenesis of HCMV-spurred diseases.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973460","annotations":[{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.786648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.508347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"1717","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1717"},{"name":"HCMV (human cytomegalovirus)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCMV_(human_cytomegalovirus)"},{"name":"Responsiveness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsiveness"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"}]}
