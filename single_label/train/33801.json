{"id":33801,"title":"Identification of a founder mutation for maple syrup urine disease in Hutterites.","abstract":"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an organic acidemia detected on newborn screening. The condition has been reported with increased frequency in certain founder populations including Hutterites. We present a case of MSUD in a Hutterite boy. Mutation analysis was completed and identified a candidate founder mutation in the BCKDHB gene, specifically c.595_596delAG. Further testing of other Hutterites with MSUD is needed to determine whether additional mutations may exist.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791375","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Organic acidemia","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_acidemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Newborn screening","weight":0.594375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newborn_screening"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.436631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Maple syrup urine disease","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup_urine_disease"},{"name":"Maple","weight":0.326149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple"},{"name":"Acidosis","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hutterite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterite"},{"name":"Maple syrup","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Founder effect","weight":0.0179676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Syrup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrup"}]}
