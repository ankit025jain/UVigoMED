{"id":83354,"title":"Postoperative analgesia by infusion of local anesthetic into the surgical wound after modified radical mastectomy: a randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"There is no consensus on the efficacy of postoperative infusion of local anesthetics after radical mastectomy.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary hospital. Eighty consecutive women with operable breast cancer with indications for modified radical mastectomy without breast reconstruction were assigned randomly to receive infusion of levobupivacaine (0.5%) or saline at 2 ml/hour for 48 hours through a wound catheter. Seventy-three women finished the study (intervention group, n = 34; control group, n = 39). During surgery, all patients received 0.25% levobupivacaine (30 ml).The levobupivacaine group reported less pain (p < 0.001) than controls in the postanesthesia care unit (1.6 ± 1.3 versus 6.7 ± 1.8) and on the ward at 24 (0.8 ± 0.9 versus 4.2 ± 1.9) and 48 (0.4 ± 0.7 versus 3.3 ± 2.3) hours. In the postanesthesia care unit, the levobupivacaine group consumed less metamizole (0.4 ± 0.5 versus 0.8 ± 0.4; p < 0.001) and dexketoprofen (0.1 ± 0.3 versus 0.7 ± 0.4; p < 0.001), with differences in paracetamol use being insignificant (0.8 ± 0.4 versus 0.9 ± 0.3; p = 0.140). On the ward, the levobupivacaine group used significantly less paracetamol (0.5 ± 0.7 versus 2.0 ± 2.0; p < 0.001) and metamizole (0.2 ± 0.4 versus 1.2 ± 1.4; p < 0.001), but differences in dexketoprofen were not significant (0.03 ± 0.2 versus 0.2 ± 0.6; p = 0.074). In the postanesthesia care unit, the levobupivacaine and control groups consumed 0 ± 0 and 0.7 ± 1.2 doses of opioids (p = 0.001), respectively. The authors observed no differences in nausea and vomiting at any stage in the postanesthesia care unit (0.2 ± 0.4 versus 0.4 ± 0.5; p = 0.081) or on the ward (0.3 ± 0.5 versus 0.4 ± 0.5; p = 0.563). All participants reported high levels of satisfaction.Continuous infusion of local anesthetic reduces pain and analgesic consumption, with high satisfaction, but does not affect rates of nausea and vomiting.","date":"2014-11-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415108","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Breast reconstruction","weight":0.838117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reconstruction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Local anesthetic","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.745682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.459367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.426053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Radical mastectomy","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_mastectomy"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Levobupivacaine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levobupivacaine"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
