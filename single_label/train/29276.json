{"id":29276,"title":"Overcoming oxaliplatin hypersensitivity: different strategies are needed according to the severity and previous exposure.","abstract":"This study investigated the characteristics of oxaliplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) and evaluated the efficacy of premedication and desensitization administration for controlling HSR in patients with gastrointestinal malignancy.This retrospective study includes oxaliplatin hypersensitivity cases reported to our in-hospital, adverse drug reaction monitoring system between May 2008 and April 2012. We analyzed administration histories of oxaliplatin and premedication treatments, chemotherapy cycle and severity of the initial HSR, and prophylactic measures and their outcomes in subsequent chemotherapy cycles.One hundred and seventy-three patients showed hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Oxaliplatin HSR developed after mean chemotherapy cycle 6.3 ± 0.3. Specifically, while HSR occurred at cycle 7.6 ± 0.3 in the case of patients previously unexposed to oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy, it occurred at cycle 2.6 ± 0.3 in previously exposed patients. Of the 173 patients who exhibited HSR, premedication was administered in 134 patients and 71.6 % of them succeeded in preventing HSR. Desensitization was attempted in 38 patients, including 20 patients in whom premedication administration was unsuccessful, and 89 % of desensitized patients successfully underwent oxaliplatin chemotherapy without HSR. As severity of HSR increased, the success rate by premedication decreased and the percentage of patients that underwent desensitization increased.Attention should be paid to patients with any prior exposure to oxaliplatin, especially during early chemotherapy cycles. Given the high success rate of preventing HSR by desensitization administration and its apparent safety profile, we suggest that desensitization be considered as the first option for the treatment of grades 3 and 4 HSR cases.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696124","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.884752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.615797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Premedication","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premedication"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.418376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.346841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.341667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Desensitization (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_(medicine)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"America's Next Top Model, Cycle 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Next_Top_Model,_Cycle_2"},{"name":"Desensitization (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_(psychology)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"America's Next Top Model, Cycle 6","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Next_Top_Model,_Cycle_6"}]}
