{"id":25457,"title":"[Effect of pretreatment with qishen yiqi dropping pills on right cardiac function of patients undergoing valve replacement].","abstract":"In this study, 120 patients with rheumatic heart disease undergoing valve replacement were randomly divided into the control group and the Qishen group, with 60 cases in each group. Before the operation, the control group was given routine heart and diuretic treatments and placebo of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills for seven days (0.5 g each time, three times a day); While the Qishen group was given Qishen Yiqi dropping pills for seven days (0.5 g each time after meal, three times a day) on the basis of the routine treatments. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV), end-systolic volume (RVESV), stroke volume (SV) and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) were detected after the operation. The results showed that patients in the two groups showed significantly lower right ventricular end diastolic volume (RVEDV), right ventricular end systolic volume (RVESV) and stroke volume (SV) decreased than that before the operation, but with significantly higher Ejection fraction (RVEF) significantly than that before the operation. However, the Qishen group showed a significantly lower right heart function reduction than the control group, with the statistical significance in the differences (P < 0.05). This indicated that the pretreatment with Qishenyiqi Drop Pills showed a remarkable efficacy in the improvement of right ventricular function after valve replacement.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25204190","annotations":[{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Stroke volume","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_volume"},{"name":"Rheumatic fever","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatic_fever"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.77631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"End-diastolic volume","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-diastolic_volume"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.560932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"End-systolic volume","weight":0.276894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-systolic_volume"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.234633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Right heart","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_heart"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Combined oral contraceptive pill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"}]}
