{"id":78919,"title":"Results of a prospective surgical audit of bilateral paediatric cochlear implantation in the UK.","abstract":"Following the approval of bilateral paediatric cochlear implantation in 2009, the prospective multi-centre UK National Paediatric Cochlear Implant Audit was established to collect a large dataset of paediatric implantations. The aim of the surgical part of the audit, reported here, was to collect data on surgical practice, outcomes and complications.Data from 14 surgical centres was collected prospectively, including simultaneous and sequential bilateral as well as unilateral implantations. Data collected included age at implantation, aetiology of deafness, implant type, duration of surgery, the use of electrophysiological testing, and the use of pre- and post-operative imaging. Details of major and immediate minor complications were also recorded.1397 CI procedures in 961 CI recipients were included; 436 bilateral simultaneous, 394 bilateral sequential, 131 unilateral. The overall major complication rate was 1.6% (0.9% excluding device failure) and was similar following bilateral CI compared to sequential and unilateral CI.This prospective multi-centre audit provides evidence that bilateral paediatric CI is a safe procedure in the UK, thus endorsing its role as a major therapeutic intervention in childhood deafness.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533758","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.446566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.36118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.346553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.336682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.313981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"394","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/394"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"961","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/961"},{"name":"1397","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1397"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Minuscule 436","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_436"}]}
