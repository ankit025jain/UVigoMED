{"id":43065,"title":"[Functions of T lymphocytes mediated by in vitro dendritic cells of chronic HBV infection patients in different immune states: a clinical research].","abstract":"To explore the improvement of dendritic cells' (DCs) functions in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients by two different drugs plasma, i.e., Shen supplementing and detoxification (SSD) and Pi invigorating and detoxification (PID), thus comparing which method was more effective to activate DCs to improve T lymphocyte functions.Totally 30 CHB outpatients were recruited. They were assigned to the immune tolerant group and the immune clearance group, 15 in each group. Totally 60 mL peripheral blood was extracted to isolate and develop mature DCs. Chinese compound containing (Liuwei Ganlu Syrup for SSD) and (Sijun Ganlu Syrup for PID) plasma were added to promote the maturation of DCs on the 7th day. Besides, non-drug plasma was taken as the control. On the ninth day, HBV core 18-27 loaded core peptide and its own T lymphocyte were co-cultivated for 72 h. Then T lymphocytes were collected. The expression levels of CD3, CD28, CD4, and CD8, programmed death-1 (PD-1) were detected using flow cytometry.Compared with non-drug plasma, the expression levels of CD3, CD4, and CD28 could be improved, and the expression levels of CD8 and PD-1 could be reduced by the two methods, showing statistical difference (P < 0.05). Besides, SSD containing plasma showed better effect in improving the molecular CD28 expression rate, and reducing the molecular PD-1 expression rate on the T cell surface, showing statistical difference when compared with that of PID containing plasma (P < 0.05).In vitro intervention of DCs by SSD and PID containing plasmas combined co-cultivation of its own T lymphocytes could promote the activation of DCs to improve the function of T cells and the expression of T cell surface molecules. Besides, SSD showed more significant effect on infection immune of HBV patients in the tolerance stage.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Digestive System
