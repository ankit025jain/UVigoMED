{"id":21988,"title":"Collagen cross-linking with photoactivated riboflavin (PACK-CXL) for the treatment of advanced infectious keratitis with corneal melting.","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy and safety of corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) with photoactivated riboflavin (photoactivated chromophore for infectious keratitis [PACK]-CXL) in the management of infectious keratitis with corneal melting.Prospective clinical trial.Forty eyes from 40 patients with advanced infectious keratitis and coexisting corneal melting.Twenty-one patients (21 eyes) underwent PACK-CXL treatment in addition to antimicrobial therapy. The control group consisted of 19 patients (19 eyes) who received only antimicrobial therapy.The slit-lamp characteristics of the corneal ulceration, corrected distance visual acuity, duration until healing, and complications were documented in each group. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.The average time until healing was 39.76 ± 18.22 days in the PACK-CXL group and 46.05 ± 27.44 days in the control group (P = 0.68). After treatment and healing, corrected distance visual acuity was 1.64 ± 0.62 in the PACK-CXL group and 1.67 ± 0.48 in the control group (P = 0.68). The corneal ulceration's width and length was significantly bigger in the PACK-CXL group (P = 0.004 and P = 0.007). Three patients in the control group demonstrated corneal perforation; infection recurred in 1 of them. No serious complications occurred in the PACK-CXL group.Corneal CXL with photoactivated riboflavin did not shorten the time to corneal healing; however, the complication rate was 21% in the control group, whereas there was no incidence of corneal perforation or recurrence of the infection in the PACK-CXL group. These results indicate that PACK-CXL may be an effective adjuvant therapy in the management of severe infectious keratitis associated with corneal melting.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576886","annotations":[{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.83645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Keratitis","weight":0.670433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.650946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.636534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.433312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.363489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.341649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Corneal ulcer","weight":0.166125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_ulcer"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.146702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.111102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Chromophore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophore"},{"name":"Corneal perforation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_perforation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Melting point","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
