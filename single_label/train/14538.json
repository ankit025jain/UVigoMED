{"id":14538,"title":"Azithromycin analogue CSY0073 attenuates lung inflammation induced by LPS challenge.","abstract":"Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. Long-term azithromycin therapy in patients with chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis has been associated with increased antimicrobial resistance, emergence of hypermutable strains, ototoxicity and cardiac toxicity. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of the non-antibiotic azithromycin derivative CSY0073.We compared the effects of CSY0073 with those of azithromycin in experiments on bacterial cultures, Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm, lung cells and mice challenged intranasally with P. aeruginosa LPS.In contrast to azithromycin, CSY0073 did not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus influenzae and had no effect on an established P. aeruginosa biofilm. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and lung homogenates collected after the LPS challenge in mice showed that CSY0073 and azithromycin (200 mgÂ·kg(-1), i.p.) decreased neutrophil counts at 24 h and TNF-?, CXCL1 and CXCL2 levels in the BAL fluid after 3 h and IL-6, CXCL2 and IL-1? levels in the lung after 3 h compared with the vehicle. However, only azithromycin reduced IL-1? levels in the lung 24 h post LPS challenge. CSY0073 and azithromycin similarly diminished the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, but not lung epithelial cells, exposed to P. aeruginosa LPS.Unlike azithromycin, CSY0073 had no antibacterial effects but it did have a similar anti-inflammatory profile to that of azithromycin. Hence, CSY0073 may have potential as a long-term treatment for patients with chronic lung diseases.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Animal
