{"id":81644,"title":"Patient satisfaction with single-tooth implant therapy in the esthetic zone.","abstract":"This prospective study assessed patient satisfaction before and after single-tooth implant therapy in the esthetic zone. Before implant therapy, patients wore an acrylic resin tissue-supported removable partial denture (RPD). A total of 153 patients were included. Self-administered questionnaires regarding function, comfort, and esthetics were used to measure patient satisfaction with the RPD and with the implant at 6 and 18 months post-implant placement. Overall satisfaction was explored with a visual analog scale. It was suggested that patient satisfaction with a single-tooth implant in the esthetic zone is high and it improved when compared with an RPD that patients wore before implant treatment.
