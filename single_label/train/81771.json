{"id":81771,"title":"The effects of ULF-TENS stimulation on gnathology: the state of the art.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the state of the art in the current literature regarding the effect of ultra low frequency-transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (ULF-TENS) on patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).The authors reviewed the literature through a thorough manual and electronic research on PubMed database (using the Medical Subject Headings thesaurus) and subsequent analysis of all the found papers regarding the effect of TENS on TMD patients. No randomized controlled trials on the investigated topic were found. Only eight papers regarding controlled clinical trials (CCT) were selected according to the search strategy selection criteria.According to the available literature and the authors' experience, ULF-TENS seems to be a valid support in the management of TMD patients, but also a 'provocative' tool, so its application should always be monitored by electromyographic and electrognathographic analysis (before and after TENS).Further clinical studies (mainly randomized controlled trials) on ULF-TENS application in neuromuscular gnathology are needed.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839723","annotations":[{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.903181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.806344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.806321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Thesaurus","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.215637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation","weight":0.200136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Medical Subject Headings","weight":0.15609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Subject_Headings"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.148525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Subject (philosophy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"},{"name":"State of the art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art"},{"name":"Library of Congress Subject Headings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Subject_Headings"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"}]}
