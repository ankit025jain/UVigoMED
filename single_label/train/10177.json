{"id":10177,"title":"Thiophene carboxamide inhibitors of JAK2 as potential treatments for myleoproliferative neoplasms.","abstract":"A series of carboxamide-substituted thiophenes demonstrating inhibition of JAK2 is described. Development of this chemical series began with the bioisosteric replacement of a urea substituent by a pyridyl ring. Issues of chemical and metabolic stability were solved using the results of both in vitro and in vivo studies, ultimately delivering compounds such as 24 and 25 that performed well in an acute PK/PD model measuring p-STAT5 inhibition.
