{"id":80972,"title":"[Epidemic monitoring of schistosomiasis in Huangchang Village, Shashi District, from 2005 to 2010].","abstract":"To understand the changes of epidemic situation of schistosomiasis in Shashi District, Jingzhou City.From 2005 to 2010, each year, from April to May, thestatus of Oncomelania snails were investigate by using the systematic sampling approach; in October, the inhabitants aged over 6 years were screened by indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) and the positive persons received the etiological examination (Kato-Katz technique). All the farm cattle in pens were examined by using the plastic cup jacking hatching method. The data of control measures, and the nature and society data were collected annually. All the data were analyzed systematically.From 2005-2010, the positive rate of blood tests was from 16.47% to 26.84%, assuming an ascend trend; the positive rate of stool examinations was from 2.13% to 4.44%, assuming a downward trend; the infection rate of cattle was from 1.56% to 18.00%, assuming a downward trend in volatility. The area with snails, the appearance rate of frames with living snails, and the average density of living snails assumed ascend trends.The prevalence of schistosomiasis presents a downward trend in volatility, and the snail status assumes a ascend trend. Therefore, the prevention and control measures still should be strengthened.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490377","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.367871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.252852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.125081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Systematic sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_sampling"},{"name":"Jingzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingzhou"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Hemagglutination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutination"},{"name":"Shashi District","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashi_District"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Imperial Household Agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Household_Agency"},{"name":"Jacking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacking"},{"name":"Plastic cup","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_cup"},{"name":"Ascend","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascend"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Volatility (chemistry)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Hatching system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatching_system"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
