{"id":85452,"title":"Cost-benefit analysis of polysomnography versus Clinical Assessment Score-15 (CAS-15) for treatment of pediatric sleep-disordered breathing.","abstract":"To determine the cost of medical care using the Clinical Assessment Score-15 (CAS-15) scale versus polysomnography (PSG) for children with sleep-disordered breathing in terms of benefit.Cost-benefit analysis.Hospital-based pediatric otolaryngology practice.Ninety-three patients from our original CAS-15 study were included. Four clinical measures were used and payment data were obtained. Cost-benefit analysis was performed for 2 clinical pathways. In pathway 1, all children had PSG; those with positive studies were referred for adenotonsillectomy. In pathway 2, children with CAS-15 ? 32 were referred for adenotonsillectomy regardless of PSG. Paired t test compared intrasubject mean total cost (pathway 1 vs pathway 2). Further analyses computed a change score for the clinical measures (follow-up minus baseline); these were divided by estimated treatment cost, producing 4 cost-benefit ratios for each pathway. Paired t tests compared the mean of these ratios between the pathways.Of 65 PSG+ (15 CAS-), 54 underwent surgery; of 28 PSG- (17 CAS-), 7 underwent surgery. Model estimated costs demonstrate a mean cost benefit of $US1172 (SE = $214) for pathway 2 versus pathway 1 (P < .001). CAS-15 is also cost-beneficial versus PSG in 3 of 4 clinical measures (Child Behavior Checklist total problem T score, P = .008, mean OSA-18 survey score, P < .001, apnea hypopnea index, P < .001).We present evidence that a CAS-15-based treatment decision criterion is superior to PSG in terms of monetary cost and in benefit per unit cost for 3 of 4 clinical measures evaluated.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934320","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.611136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.567693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hypopnea","weight":0.335145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopnea"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.226491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clinical pathway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pathway"},{"name":"Child Behavior Checklist","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Behavior_Checklist"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"1172","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1172"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Monetary policy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy"},{"name":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Paris Saint-Germain F.C.","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C."},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Total cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost"},{"name":"Payment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment"},{"name":"Unit cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cost"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
