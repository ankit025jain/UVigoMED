{"id":15097,"title":"[Frequency of occurrence of ivyC and pliC lysozyme inhibitors genes in clinical klebsiella strains].","abstract":"Chromosomal ivyC and plasmid pliC lysozyme inhibitor genes frequency of occurrence detection in klebsiella strains of various origins.129 strains were studied including K. pneumoniae (n= 115) and K. oxytoca (n=14). Klebsiella strains were divided into 2 groups: group 1 - 62 strains (39 isolated in Kazan and 23 strains isolated from children with klebsiella infection in Moscow). Kazan strains were presented by isolates from young children receiving in-patient treatment regarding klebsiella (n=8), respiratory (n= 17), rotavirus (n=5) and purulent-inflammation infection ofnewborns (n=9). Group 2 (n=67) was composed of strains isolated from children that had received outpatient treatment regarding intestine dysbacteriosis in Kazan (n=37) and Moscow (n=30). ivyC and pliC gene detection was carried out by PCR (N.B. Perunova et al., 2012).Chromosomal ivyC gene determinants were isolated in 40.3% of cases (52 strains of 129), plasmid pliC gene - 6.9% (9 of 129). ivyC gene frequency of occurrence in klebsiella strains isolated from 39 ill children of Kazan was 46.6% of cases (18 of 39), in Moscow clinical strains - 95.5% (22 of 23) cases, wherein 6 strains had ivyC and pliC genes at the same time. Dysbiosis intestine strains had chromosomal ivyC gene at the frequency of 61.2% (41 of 67), 1 strain additionally had pliC gene.. The presence of ivyC and pliC lysozyme inhibitor genes in klebsiella clinical strains provides bacteria with selective advantages in various biotopes in the process of bacterial colonization of mucous membrane.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286520","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Lysozyme","weight":0.885779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysozyme"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.847604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.264447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.183406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Colony (biology)","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Dysbiosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbiosis"},{"name":"Klebsiella oxytoca","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_oxytoca"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Biotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotope"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
