{"id":50128,"title":"Germline and somatic DICER1 mutations in a pituitary blastoma causing infantile-onset Cushing's disease.","abstract":"Pituitary blastoma causing Cushing's syndrome in infancy is very rare, and its molecular pathomechanism is not well understood.Our objective was to identify genetic changes of a pituitary blastoma causing infantile-onset Cushing's syndrome in a Thai girl without a family history of cancers.Genomic DNA from both leukocytes and tumor tissues was used for whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing of DICER1. The cDNA reverse-transcribed from RNA extracted from both leukocytes and tumor tissues was used for Sanger sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and pyrosequencing of DICER1.WES of leukocytes identified a novel heterozygous c.3046delA (p.S1016VfsX1065) mutation in the DICER1 gene. WES of the tumor tissues detected the same frameshift germline mutation and another novel somatic missense c.5438A?T (p.E1813V) mutation. Both mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the DICER1 mRNA levels of the tumor tissues were 54% compared with those of her leukocytes. Pyrosequencing showed that the deletion allele constituted 12% and 0% of the DICER1 cDNA of the proband's leukocytes and tumor tissues, respectively.Our study extends the phenotypic and mutational spectrum of DICER1 mutations to include infantile-onset Cushing's disease and 2 novel mutations. Loss of function of both DICER1 alleles appears to be crucial to initiate tumor development.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Endocrine System
