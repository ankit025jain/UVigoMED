{"id":65656,"title":"Fatty kidney: emerging role of ectopic lipid in obesity-related renal disease.","abstract":"The global increase in chronic kidney disease (CKD) parallels the obesity epidemic. Obesity conveys a gradual but independent risk of progression of CKD that seems irrespective of the underlying nephropathy. Obesity has been associated with a secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis coined obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). Pathways through which obesity might cause renal disease are not well understood, and early clinical biomarkers for incipient ORG or renal relevant obesity are currently lacking. Recent human and experimental studies have associated ectopic lipid accumulation in the kidney (fatty kidney) with obesity-related renal disease. There is enough growing insight that ectopic lipid--the accumulation of lipid in non-adipose tissue--is associated with structural and functional changes of mesangial cells, podocytes, and proximal tubular cells to propose the development of ORG as a maladaptive response to hyperfiltration and albuminuria. Recent advances in metabolic imaging might validate ectopic lipid as a biomarker and research aid, to help translate novel therapeutics from experimental models to patients.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795255","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.903702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.806166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.702289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.564224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.505457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Podocyte","weight":0.214973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocyte"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.17436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Mesangium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesangium"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Mesangial cell","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesangial_cell"}]}
