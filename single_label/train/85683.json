{"id":85683,"title":"[Symptoms and natural history of hospital chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].","abstract":"Since few years, the data describing the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have changed and new concepts have emerged.To study the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with COPD in a Tunisian population.It is a retrospective study including 150 patients with COPD admitted at the pulmonary department of Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis, during a period of ten years.Data from 150 patients hospitalized at the pulmonary department of Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis, were analyzed. They were 126 men and 24 women with a mean age of 67 years. Tobacco was the predominant risk factor. Eighty-two (55%) patients were classified GOLD stage IV at diagnosis. The number of exacerbation varied from 1 to 7 with an average higher in patients classified as stage IV (p = 0.007).The COPD is pathology of smoking men. Comorbidities and exacerbations prevalence increase according the disease severity. In fact, better knowledge of exacerbations etiologies allows considering better measurement of prevention.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879164","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.643318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.479809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.419001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.310135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.21235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"History","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Charles Nicolle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nicolle"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Tunisia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
