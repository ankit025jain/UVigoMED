{"id":45518,"title":"Regenerative medicine: tissue-engineered cell sheet for the prevention of post-esophageal ESD stricture.","abstract":"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have captured the world's attention and directed an unprecedented focus on regenerative medicine. The potential of iPS cells to aid in the development of new treatments for various diseases is exciting, and researchers are only beginning to discover their potential benefits for humans. iPS cells are more effective if they are interconnected with tissues; however, new technologies are needed to create and transplant these tissues. This study introduces a new connection between endoscopy and regenerative medicine in gastroenterology through specifically addressing how cell sheet technology can be a viable method of tissue creation and transplantation.
