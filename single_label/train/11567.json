{"id":11567,"title":"Viral determinants of influenza A virus host range.","abstract":"Typical avian influenza A viruses are restricted from replicating efficiently and causing disease in humans. However, an avian virus can become adapted to humans by mutating or recombining with currently circulating human viruses. These viruses have the potential to cause pandemics in an immunologically na√Øve human population. It is critical that we understand the molecular basis of host-range restriction and how this can be overcome. Here, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms by which influenza viruses adapt to replicate efficiently in a new host. We predominantly focus on the influenza polymerase, which remains one of the least understood host-range barriers.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584475","annotations":[{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.892155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.661902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.557171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.512631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.485979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.466718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
