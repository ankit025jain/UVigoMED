{"id":51340,"title":"[How do Swiss family physicians treat subclinical hypothyroidism?].","abstract":"Subclinical hypothyroidism is a common condition, and its prevalence increases with age. Currently, guidelines regarding the screening and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are controversial. An international survey of general practitioners (GPs), to which Swiss GPs also contributed, showed large inter-country variations in treatment strategies for subclinical hypothyroidism. These differences are mainly explained by the lack of strong evidence for the management of this condition. The European randomized-controlled clinical trial TRUST should help clarify recommendations for screening and thyroxin replacement for the elderly with subclinical hypothyroidism. Working in close collaboration with GPs in Switzerland for the recruitment of patients will ensure that the findings from this study will be applicable to primary care settings.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701670","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.657598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.52031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.511853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.204876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.102124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.0478909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Trieste United States Troops","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste_United_States_Troops"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
