{"id":22735,"title":"[Prevention of vertical transmission and side effects of antiretroviral therapy in children born to HIV-positive South Eastern area of Santiago, Chile: 15-years perspective].","abstract":"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has shown to be an effective measure in decreasing HIV vertical transmission (VT). Nevertheless, it is not free from adverse effects in the newborn: risk of prematurity, low birth weight, metabolic disorders, among others. Despite the importance of the subject, there are few national data that analyze the problem. We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of HIV positive mother/child binomial, followed between 1995 and 2010. Ninety-four pregnancies and 96 children (2 twin pregnancies) were analyzed. The rate of VT was 2.1%. Adverse effects attributed to ART were found on 85.4% of the newborn; highlighting the presence of anemia (70.8%) and several metabolic disorders [elevated lactate without acidosis (29.2%), lactic acidosis (12.5%), hyperkalemia (14.6%), metabolic acidosis (9.4%)]. Maternal exposure to protease inhibitors proved to be an independent risk factor for the development of metabolic disorders in newborns (OR 0.15 [0.04-0.48], p < 0.01). In our series, ART was effective in reducing the VT, however exposed newborns showed a high frequency of adverse effects, so it is advisable to implement programs for monitoring these patients to prevent sequelae.
