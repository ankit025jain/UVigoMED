{"id":65893,"title":"High-dose interleukin-2 therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a contemporary experience.","abstract":"To present our experience of high-dose interleukin-2 (HDIL-2) in a high-volume National Cancer Institute-designated center for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).Patients with mRCC who received HDIL-2 monotherapy as a first- or second-line therapy during 2004-2011 were identified. Demographics, pathologic variables, renal function, time until the start of HDIL-2 therapy, number of cycles (1-3), responses (complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease), and primary renal cell carcinoma treatment were analyzed. Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were determined.Of 906 patients in the kidney cancer database, 91 patients with mRCC were treated with HDIL-2 and 18 patients (20.5%) underwent prior cytoreductive nephrectomy. Median age was 51 years, and 73.9% were men. Median follow-up was 45 months. Pretreatment renal function impairment led to more treatment cycles (2-3) than in those with adequate initial kidney function (92.3% vs 50.6%, respectively; P = .002). Lower tumor stage correlated with a better response (P = .023) and with longer time from diagnosis to initiation of HDIL-2 (P = .011). Complications included hypotension (67.4%), renal impairment (63%), impaired liver function (42.4%), and thrombocytopenia (31.5%). Four patients (4.5%) had a complete response, 10 (11.4%) had a partial response, and 28 (31.8%) had a stable disease. Median progression-free survival and OS were 8.6 and 35.5 months, respectively. The estimated 2-year OS rate was 60.6%.Incorporating HDIL-2 therapy in the treatment strategies for mRCC added to the patients' survival in this series. HDIL-2 therapy is well tolerated in patients with pre-existing renal impairment with no long-term renal toxicity.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767525","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.845879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.797086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.593124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.42556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.328331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.253147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
