{"id":27226,"title":"Height and heart disease.","abstract":"Height has a relationship with a number of medical conditions, including heart disease. Atrial fibrillation has been observed to be more common in taller individuals. Marfan syndrome, with its high prevalence of mitral valve disease and abnormalities of the aorta, is associated with increased height. Mitral valve prolapse in patients without Marfan syndrome may be more common in taller people. Conversely, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and possibly aortic valve calcification are less prevalent with increasing height. The relationship between height and health will be of increasing importance as the population grows taller.
