{"id":45598,"title":"The inhibition of Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway in human colon cancer cells by sulindac.","abstract":"The aberrant activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling plays important roles in the initial development of colon cancer. Sulindac is a commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. We demonstrated the effects of sulindac on growth inhibition, apoptosis induction, and Wnt/?-catenin signaling suppression in human colon cancer cells. Sulindac significantly inhibited proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Sulindac was found to induce the apoptosis of HT-29 cells and inhibit the Wnt/?-catenin pathway. The inhibition was further confirmed by the decreased protein levels of ?-catenin. The results indicate that sulindac may play a beneficial role in the comprehensive treatment of colon cancer.
