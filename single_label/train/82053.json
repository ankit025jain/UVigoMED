{"id":82053,"title":"Combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates.Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the Etest. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated.Synergy, i.e. FICI values ? 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two A. actinomycetemcomitans (FICI: 0.3), two F. nucleatum (FICI: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one E. corrodens (FICI: 0.4) isolates. Indifference, i.e. FIC indices of >0.5 but ?4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 P. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. Microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by Etest.Combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and E. corrodens. Synergy was shown for a few strains only.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727003","annotations":[{"name":"Metronidazole","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronidazole"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.696202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Fusobacterium","weight":0.613286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusobacterium"},{"name":"Fusobacterium nucleatum","weight":0.44854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusobacterium_nucleatum"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Eikenella corrodens","weight":0.32545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eikenella_corrodens"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.265779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.215389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Prevotella","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevotella"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.185889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregatibacter_actinomycetemcomitans"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Actinobacillus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacillus"},{"name":"Combinatorics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Apathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Imperial College London","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
