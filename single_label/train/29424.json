{"id":29424,"title":"Serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) measurement: an update.","abstract":"Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a widely studied enzyme based on its protective role against poisoning by organophosphate (OP) metabolites of specific OP insecticides and in vascular disease, as well as its use as biomarker of diseases involving oxidative stress, inflammation and liver diseases.This review provides an update about the current knowledge in the field of the analytical procedures that are used for PON1 measurements. It will be specially focused on: (a) characteristics of the different substrates used for measuring PON1, with emphasis in four aspects: toxicity, polymorphism influence, rate of hydrolysis and diagnostic performance. And (b) the technical aspects of PON1 assays, in which the reagents and reaction conditions, sources of variation, quality control systems, equipment and interferences with other esterases will be discussed.The information provided in this review can contribute to a more accurate and safe measurements of PON1 in laboratories and encourage researchers to explore the wide areas of PON1 in veterinary medicine that are still unknown.
