{"id":15847,"title":"Alternative genotyping of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.","abstract":"The aim of the present research was to study the capability of a genotyping method for M. tuberculosis through detection of six VNTR-loci (MIRU10, MIRU26, MIRU31, MIRU39, MIRU40, ETR-A). Loci MIRU10, MIRU26, MIRU40 and ETR-A have exhibited high polymorphism in group non-Beijing, while loci MIRU26 and MIRU31 - in the Beijing family. A combined detection of all six loci for fingerprinting of the isolates both from Beijing and non-Beijing was highly effective (Hunter-Gaston index was 0.88 and 0.93 correspondently), especially in areas with limited financial resources and high prevalence of multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis strains.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115121","annotations":[{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.744689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.70518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.622487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.540825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.530807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.185993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.171004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Fingerprint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
