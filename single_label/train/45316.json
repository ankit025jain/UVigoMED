{"id":45316,"title":"Febrile pleuropericarditis, a potentially life-threatening adverse event of balsalazide--case report and literature review of the side effects of 5-aminosalicylates.","abstract":"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the colonic mucosa. One class among the drugs used for its treatment is the 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs). While highly efficacious in treating mild-to-moderate UC, 5-ASAs are associated with rare but potentially life-threatening side effects such as pericarditis, myocarditis and pneumonitis. These adverse events appear to be caused by a hypersensitivity reaction and resolve after cessation of 5-ASA drugs. This article presents a case report of febrile pleuropericarditis in a UC patient treated with balsalazide, and provides a thorough literature review of the rare side effects of 5-ASAs, their incidence, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and treatment. In conclusion, the clinicians should be aware that this type of adverse events to 5-ASA compounds can be easily overlooked but it has significant morbidity if not promptly diagnosed.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689504","annotations":[{"name":"Myocarditis","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis"},{"name":"Pericarditis","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericarditis"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.870536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.849819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.798817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.751024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.648725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.594264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.545951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pneumonitis","weight":0.127693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonitis"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
