{"id":86862,"title":"Sex differences in nutritional status of HIV-exposed children in Rwanda: a longitudinal study.","abstract":"To examine sex differences in nutritional status in relation to feeding practices over time in a cohort of HIV-exposed children participating in a complementary feeding programme in Rwanda.We applied a longitudinal design with three measurements 2-3 months apart among infants participating in a complementary feeding programme who were 6-12 months old at baseline. Using early feeding practices and a composite infant and child feeding index (ICFI) as indicators of dietary patterns, we conducted a multivariate analysis using a cross-sectional time series to assess sex differences in nutritional status and to determine whether there was a link to discrepancies in dietary patterns.Among 222 boys and 258 girls, the mean (±SD) Z-score of stunting, wasting and underweight was -2.01 (±1.59), -0.15 (±1.46), -1.19 (±1.29) for boys; for girls they were -1.46 (±1.56), 0.22 (±1.29), -0.63 (±1.19); all sex differences in all three indicators were statistically significant (P < 0.001). However, there were only minor differences in early feeding practices and none in the ICFI by sex.HIV-exposed male children may be at higher risk of malnutrition in low-resource setting countries than their female counterparts. However, at least in a setting where complementary foods are being provided, explanations may lie outside the sphere of dietary patterns.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345559","annotations":[{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.806783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.787189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.564344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.369015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Time series","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.189899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Rwanda","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"258","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/258"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Cachexia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cachexia"},{"name":"International Committee of the Fourth International","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Fourth_International"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Stunting (broadcasting)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunting_(broadcasting)"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Equine nutrition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equine_nutrition"},{"name":"Women in the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China"}]}
