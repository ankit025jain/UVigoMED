{"id":82406,"title":"Correlation of deregulated like-acetylglucosaminyl transferase and aberrant ?-dystroglycan expression with human tongue cancer metastasis.","abstract":"The present study examined the correlation of ?-dystroglycan (?-DG) expression and like-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (LARGE) with metastasis of human tongue cancer.Fifty human tongue cancer tissues and 2 tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (CAL27 and SCC4) were involved. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of ?-DG and LARGE. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess the methylation status of the LARGE gene promoter. CAL27 and SCC4 cells were transfected with exogenous LARGE and treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza-dC), respectively. Glycol sites of ?-DG were detected by western blotting. In addition, the laminin overlay assay, cell adhesion assay, and invasion assay were performed.Immunohistochemical results showed that decreased expression of VIA4-1 and IIH6 (antibodies that recognize the glycol sites of ?-DG) were correlated with the lymph node metastasis of tongue cancer (n = 50; P = .016 and .025, respectively). Decreased LARGE expression and hypermethylation of the LARGE gene promoter were correlated with lymph node metastasis and ?-DG glycosylation in human tongue cancer (n = 50; P = .043 and .015 respectively). In addition, LARGE overexpression and Aza-dC treatment actively led to restoration of functional ?-DG expression, elevation of laminin binding, and decrease of migratory ability in cancer cells.The results suggested that absent ?-DG expression and LARGE deregulation were closely associated with nodal metastasis of tongue cancer. Aberrant ?-DG expression and glycosylation were attributed at least in part to the abnormal epigenetic modification of LARGE, especially the hypermethylation of its promoter.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629698","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph
