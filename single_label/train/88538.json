{"id":88538,"title":"Acrolein detection: potential theranostic utility in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury.","abstract":"Oxidative stress has been implicated as a major pathological process underlying CNS disease and trauma. More specifically, acrolein, an unsaturated aldehyde, produced by way of lipid peroxidation, has been shown to play a crucial role in initiating and perpetuating detrimental effects associated with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. In light of these findings, quantification of acrolein levels both systemically and locally could allow for the use of acrolein as a biomarker to aid in diagnosis and guide treatment regimens. The three main approaches currently available are acrolein derivatization followed by LC/GC-MS, application of an acrolein antibody and subsequent immunoblotting, and the 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid-based method. Of these three strategies, the 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid-based method is the least invasive allowing for rapid translation of acrolein detection into a clinical setting.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831349","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.924931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.752786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.666864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.524832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.448425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Aldehyde","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Acrolein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrolein"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
