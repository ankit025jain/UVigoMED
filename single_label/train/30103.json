{"id":30103,"title":"The trace amine associated receptor 1 agonist RO5263397 attenuates the induction of cocaine behavioral sensitization in rats.","abstract":"The trace amine associated receptor (TAAR) 1 is a new G protein coupled receptor that critically modulates central dopaminergic system. Recently, several selective TAAR 1 ligands have been described to possess antipsychotic and antidepressant-like activities. However, it is unknown of the role of these ligands in modulating psychostimulant-induced neurobehavioral plasticity. This study examined the effects of a selective TAAR 1 agonist, RO5263397, on cocaine induced behavioral sensitization in rats, a rodent model of drug-induced behavioral plasticity. Daily treatment with 15mg/kg cocaine (i.p., 7 days) induced robust locomotor sensitization in rats. RO5263397 (1-10mg/kg, i.p.) alone did not significantly alter the locomotor activity. Acute treatment with RO5263397 (3.2 and 10mg/kg) did not significantly modify cocaine-induced hyperactivity; however, the induction of locomotor sensitization was significantly blocked after 7 days of daily RO5263397 treatment. More importantly, the expression of locomotor sensitization remained significantly attenuated when rats were re-tested 7 days after the last drug treatment. The marked attenuation of cocaine sensitization was also evidenced by the suppression of the dose-effect function (3.2-32mg/kg) of cocaine sensitization. Together, these data represent the first to report a critical modulatory role of TAAR 1 agonists in cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity, which may be indicative of its potential role for altering other long-lasting behavioral maladaptations of cocaine including drug addiction.
