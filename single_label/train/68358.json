{"id":68358,"title":"Association between urinary cadmium and all cause, all cancer and prostate cancer specific mortalities for men: an analysis of national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES III) data.","abstract":"This study employed public use National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) data to investigate the association between urinary cadmium (UDPSI) and all cause, all cancer and prostate cancer mortalities in men.NHANES III household adult, laboratory and mortality data were merged. The sampling weight used was WTPFEX6, with SDPPSU6 applied for the probability sampling unit and SDPSTRA6 to designate the strata for the survey analysis.For prostate cancer death, the significant univariates were UDPSI, age, weight, and drinking. Under multivariate logistic regression, the significant covariates were age and weight. For all cause mortality in men, the significant covariates were UDPSI, age, and poverty income ratio. For all cancer mortality in men, the significant covariates were UDPSI, age, black and Mexican race.UDPSI was a predictor of all cause and all cancer mortalities in men as well as prostate cancer mortality.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528078","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.711976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.66658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.616307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.427163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.361725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.338342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.301923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"National Center for Health Statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Health_Statistics"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Cadmium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
