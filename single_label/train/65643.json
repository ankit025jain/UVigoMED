{"id":65643,"title":"Identification of specific Y chromosomes associated with increased prostate cancer risk.","abstract":"Evidence supports the possibility of a role of the Y chromosome in prostate cancer, but controversy exists.A novel analysis of a computerized population-based resource linking genealogy and cancer data was used to test the hypothesis of a role of the Y chromosome in prostate cancer predisposition. Using a statewide cancer registry from 1966 linked to a computerized genealogy representing over 1.2 million descendants of the Utah pioneers, 1,000 independent sets of males, each set hypothesized to share the same Y chromosome as represented in genealogy data, were tested for a significant excess of prostate cancer.Multiple Y chromosomes representing thousands of potentially at-risk males were identified to have a significant excess risk for prostate cancer.This powerful and efficient in silico test of an uncommon mode of inheritance has confirmed evidence for Y chromosome involvement in prostate cancer.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796687","annotations":[{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.52408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Utah","weight":0.433174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah"},{"name":"Genealogy","weight":0.426342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.219723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.159155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Inheritance","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"1966","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Independent set (graph theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)"},{"name":"Mode (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0156195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Mormon pioneers","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_pioneers"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Settler","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"}]}
