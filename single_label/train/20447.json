{"id":20447,"title":"Liposome-encapsulated ISMN: a novel nitric oxide-based therapeutic agent against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus in its biofilm form has been associated with recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis with significant resistance to conventional therapies. This study aims to determine if liposomal-encapsulation of a precursor of the naturally occurring antimicrobial nitric oxide (NO) enhances its desired anti-biofilm effects against S. aureus, in the hope that improving its efficacy can provide an effective topical agent for future clinical use.S. aureus ATCC 25923 biofilms were grown in-vitro using the Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) device and exposed to 3 and 60 mg/mL of the NO donor isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) encapsulated into different anionic liposomal formulations based on particle size (unilamellar ULV, multilamellar MLV) and lipid content (5 and 25 mM) at 24 h and 5 min exposure times. Biofilms were viewed using Live-Dead Baclight stain and confocal scanning laser microscopy and quantified using the software COMSTAT2.At 3 and 60 mg/mL, ISMN-ULV liposomes had comparable and significant anti-biofilm effects compared to untreated control at 24 h exposure (p?=?0.012 and 0.02 respectively). ULV blanks also had significant anti-biofilm effects at both 24 h and 5 min exposure (p?=?0.02 and 0.047 respectively). At 5 min exposure, 60 mg/mL ISMN-MLV liposomes appeared to have greater anti-biofilm effects compared to pure ISMN or ULV particles. Increasing liposomal lipid content improved the anti-biofilm efficacy of both MLV and ULVs at 5 min exposure.Liposome-encapsulated \"nitric oxide\" is highly effective in eradicating S. aureus biofilms in-vitro, giving great promise for use in the clinical setting to treat this burdensome infection. Further studies however are needed to assess its safety and efficacy in-vivo before clinical translation is attempted.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658315","annotations":[{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.787868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.724129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.717974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.572399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.505093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.478754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.411811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.397256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.32215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.0132532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"}]}
