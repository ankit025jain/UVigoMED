{"id":21756,"title":"Antibiotic use as a tragedy of the commons: a cross-sectional survey.","abstract":"Many believe antibiotic use results in a tragedy of the commons, since overuse may lead to antibiotic resistance and limiting use would benefit society. In contrast, mass antibiotic treatment programs are thought to result in community-wide benefits. A survey was conducted to learn the views of infectious disease experts on the individual- and societal-level consequences of antibiotic use.The survey instrument was designed to elicit opinions on antibiotic use and resistance. It was sent via SurveyMonkey to infectious disease professionals identified through literature searches. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.A total of 1,530 responses were received for a response rate of 9.9%. Nearly all participants believed antibiotic use could result in a tragedy of the commons, at least in certain circumstances (96.0%). Most participants did not believe mass antibiotic treatment programs could produce societal benefits in an antibiotic-free society (91.4%) or in the United States (94.2%), though more believed such programs would benefit antibiotic-free societies compared to the United States (P < 0.001).The experts surveyed believe that antibiotic use can result in a tragedy of the commons and do not believe that mass treatment programs benefit individuals or society.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24587818","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.789007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.768282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.618953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.603496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.515136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.474575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.37766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Tragedy of the commons","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0885189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0623561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"SurveyMonkey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SurveyMonkey"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"House of Commons of the United Kingdom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"The commons","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_commons"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Tragedy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy"},{"name":"Benefit society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_society"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"}]}
