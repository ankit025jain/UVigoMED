{"id":60139,"title":"[Clinical observation of haploidentical-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation combined with human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells for severe aplastic anemia-II].","abstract":"This study was purposed to investigate the efficacy and safety of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells (allo-HSCT) transplantation combined with human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell infusion (hUC-MSC) for severe aplastic anemia-II (SAA-II). Eight SAA-II patients received haploidentical allo-HSCT, the G-CSF mobilized peripheral hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells were selected as graft, the human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) were infused as the third party. Conditioning regimen consisted of rabbit anti-thymic lymphocytes protein(ATG), cyclophosphamide(CTX) and fludarabine(Flu). For two patients out of 8 SAA-II patients the conditioning regimen was combined with busulfan(BU). The graft versus host disease(GVHD) was prevented with CSA, MTX, ATG, CD25 and mycophenolate mofetil. The results showed that the average number of nucleated cells were 9.13×10(8)/kg, and number of CD34(+)cells were 3.76×10(6)/ kg. All the 8 SAA-II patients achieved hematopoietic reconstitution. The average time of neutrophils count>0.5×10(9)/L was 11.9 days, and average time of Plt level >20×10(9)/L was 14.6 days. The incidence of acute GVHD of I-II grade was 25%, and that of III-IVgrade was 12.5%, the transplantation-related mortality was 25%. It is concluded that haploidentical allo-HSCT combined with umbilical cord MSC infusion is an effective approach to cure SAA.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989293","annotations":[{"name":"CD34","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Mycophenolate mofetil","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolate_mofetil"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.781457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.64214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.565145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.521785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.310055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.107426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Word stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"}]}
