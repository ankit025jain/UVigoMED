{"id":87975,"title":"Serum biomarkers for traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"There is a lack of reliable serum biomarkers for routine use in the diagnostic workup of people with traumatic brain injury. Multiple biomediators and biomarkers have been described in the pertinent literature in recent years; however, only a few candidate molecules have been associated with high sensitivity and high specificity for risk stratification and outcome prediction after traumatic brain injury. This review was designed to provide an overview of the state of the art regarding established serum biomarkers in the field and to outline future directions of investigation.
