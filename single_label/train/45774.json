{"id":45774,"title":"Multimodal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the most common liver cancer with an increasing incidence and it accounts for the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Even though the clinical diagnosis and management of HCC improved significantly in the last decades, this malignant disease is still associated with a poor prognosis. It has to be distinguished between patients with HCCs, which developed from liver cirrhosis, and patients without underlying liver cirrhosis as classification systems, prognosis estimation and therapy recommendations differ in-between. In case of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis in Europe, treatment allocation and prognosis estimation are mainly based on the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. Based on this staging system different surgical, interventional radiological/sonographical and non-interventional procedures have been established for the multimodal treatment of HCC. The BCLC classification system represents a decision guidance; however because of its limitations in selected patients treatment allocation should be determined on an individualized rather than a guideline-based medicine by a multidisciplinary board in order to offer the best treatment option for each patient. This review summarizes the current management of HCC and illustrates controversial areas of therapeutic strategies.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666568","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.76437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.591405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.471262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.320291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Medical classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_classification"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Economic system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system"}]}
