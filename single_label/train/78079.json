{"id":78079,"title":"[Sensorineural deafness and vertebral artery aneurysm: endovascular management].","abstract":"Sensorineural deafness and vertigo have different causes among them immunological, vascular and infectious. Vascular causes of sensorineural hearing loss are unusual and among them are the vertebral artery aneurysms. Knowledge by neurosurgeons, neurointerventional and otolaryngologists aneurysms involving the development of sensorineural hearing loss is critical to establishing and determining a targeted therapeutics. We report the case of an adult handled with endovascular techniques and review the current literature of similar cases.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791362","annotations":[{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.717131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.700676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.695777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.501788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Vertebral artery","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_artery"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
