{"id":46833,"title":"Identification alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein precursor and tubulin beta chain as serology diagnosis biomarker of colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major worldwide cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality largely due to the insidious onset of the disease. The current clinical procedures utilized for disease diagnosis are invasive, unpleasant, and inconvenient. Hence, the need for simple blood tests that could be used for the early detection is crucial for its ultimate control and prevention.The present work is a case-control study focused on proteomic analysis of serum of healthy volunteers and CRC patients by the ClinProt profiling technology based on mass spectrometry. This approach allowed to identifying a pattern of proteins/peptides able to differentiate the studied populations. Moreover, some of peptides differentially expressed in the serum of patients as compared to healthy volunteers were identified by LTQ Orbitrap XL.A Quick Classifier Algorithm was used to construct the peptidome patterns (m/z 1208, 1467, 1505, 1618, 1656 and 4215) for the identification of CRC from healthy volunteers with accuracy close to 100% (>CEA, P?<?0.05). Peaks at m/z 1505 and 1618 were identified as alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein precursor and tubulin beta chain, respectively.Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein precursor and tubulin beta chain could be involved in the pathogenesis of CRC and perform as potential serology diagnosis biomarker.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here:
