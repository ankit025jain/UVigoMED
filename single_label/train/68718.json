{"id":68718,"title":"The restoration of kidney mitochondria function by inhibition of angiotensin-II production in rats with acute adriamycin-induced nephrotoxicity.","abstract":"Adriamycin (ADR) is commonly used for many solid tumor treatments. Its clinical utility is, however, largely limited by the adverse reactions, are known to be nephrotoxic. The mechanism by which it induces kidney damage is still not completely understood, but its nephrotoxicity might relate to increase reactive oxidant status (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction. Until now, neurohormonal activation of it is unclear. ADR might activate the renin angiotensin system. Angiotensin-II also induced ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether angiotensin-II production inhibition has the protective effect on attenuation of mitochondrial function in rats with acute ADR-nephrotoxicity or not. Rats were divided into five groups as a control, ADR, co-treated ADR with captopril (CAP), co-treated ADR with Aliskren, co-treated ADR with both CAP and Aliskren groups. Creatinine kinase (CK) levels were measured at the end of treatment period. The kidneys were homogenized and biochemical measurements were made in mitochondria, cytosol. Mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) and ATP levels were determined. ADR increased CK levels and oxidative stress in mitochondria too (p<0.05). ADR significantly decreased MMP and ATP level in kidney mitochondria (p<0.05). Co-administration with ADR and Aliskren and CAP improved the dissipation of MMP (p<0.05). The decrease in ATP level was restored by treatment with inhibitors of ACE and renin. We concluded that inhibitors of angiotensin-II are effective against acute ADR induced nephrotoxicity via the restoration of MMP and ATP production and prevention of mitochondrial damage in vivo.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital
