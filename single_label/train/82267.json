{"id":82267,"title":"GDF15 is a potential predictive biomarker for TPF induction chemotherapy and promotes tumorigenesis and progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Randomized trials have not shown major survival benefits when induction chemotherapy plus standard therapy is compared with standard therapy alone in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Induction chemotherapy is likely to be effective for biologically distinct subgroups and biomarker development may lead to identification of patients whose tumors are likely to respond to a particular treatment.We evaluated immunohistochemical staining for GDF15 in pretreatment biopsy specimens of 230 of 256 OSCC patients who were treated in a prospective, randomized, phase III trial on induction chemotherapy including docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF). Relationship between GDF15 intervention and cell proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation and tumorigenicity was analyzed using in vitro and in vivo OSCC models.Low GDF15 expression predicted a better survival in OSCC patients, especially overall survival [P = 0.049, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.597] and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; P = 0.031, HR = 0.562). cN+ patients with low GDF15 expression benefitted from induction TPF in overall survival (P = 0.039, HR = 0.247) and DMFS (P = 0.039, HR = 0.247), cN- patients with high GDF15 expression benefitted from induction TPF in overall survival (P = 0.019, HR = 0.231), disease-free survival (P = 0.011, HR = 0.281), locoregional recurrence-free survival (P = 0.035, HR = 0.347) and DMFS (P = 0.009, HR = 0.197). Decreased GDF15 expression in OSCC lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation and tumorigenesis through increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 (P < 0.05). Likewise, overexpression of GDF15 significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation through decreased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 (P < 0.05).","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669014","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.699177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.646163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.556969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.490425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.460235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.43416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
