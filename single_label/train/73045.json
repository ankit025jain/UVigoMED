{"id":73045,"title":"Oncogene dependency and the potential of targeted RNAi-based anti-cancer therapy.","abstract":"Cancers arise through the progression of multiple genetic and epigenetic defects that lead to deregulation of numerous signalling networks. However, the last decade has seen the development of the concept of 'oncogene addiction', where tumours appear to depend on a single oncogene for survival. RNAi has provided an invaluable tool in the identification of these oncogenes and oncogene-dependent cancers, and also presents great potential as a novel therapeutic strategy against them. Although RNAi therapeutics have demonstrated effective killing of oncogene-dependent cancers in vitro, their efficacy in vivo is severely limited by effective delivery systems. Several virus-based RNAi delivery strategies have been explored, but problems arose associated with high immunogenicity, random genome integration and non-specific targeting. This has directed efforts towards non-viral formulations, including delivery systems based on virus-like particles, liposomes and cationic polymers, which can circumvent some of these problems by immunomasking and the use of specific tumour-targeting ligands. This review outlines the prevalence of oncogene-dependent cancers, evaluates the potential of RNAi-based therapeutics and assesses the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to targeted RNAi delivery.
