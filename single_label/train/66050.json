{"id":66050,"title":"[Significance of serum cholesterol and fibrinogen in evaluating the risk of glomerulosclerosis in children with nephrotic syndrome].","abstract":"To investigate the significance of serum cholesterol and fibrinogen (Fib) in evaluating the risk of glomerulosclerosis in children with nephrotic syndrome.Sixty-three children with primary nephrotic syndrome were divided into two groups according to their pathological types: minimal change glomerulopathy (MCG) (n=39) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) groups (n=24). Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C and Fib and 24-hour urinary protein excretion were retrospectively analyzed.Serum levels of TC, non-HDL-C, and LDL-C were significantly higher in the FSGS group than in the MCG group (P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in HDL-C, Fib and 24-hour urinary protein excretion between the two groups (P>0.05). According to the results of logistic regression analysis, high levels of LDL-C, non-HDL-C and TC were risk factors for FSGS (P<0.05). In patients whose proteinuria did not disappear after taking enough glucocorticoid for 4 weeks, the level of non-HDL-C was significantly higher in the FSGS group than in the MCG group (P<0.05); there were no significant differences in TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and Fib between the MCG and FSGS groups (P>0.05).Serum cholesterol, especially non-LDL-C, is of great significance in evaluating the risk of glomerulosclerosis in children with nephrotic syndrome. There is no sufficient evidence to support serum Fib as a marker for predicting glomerulosclerosis in these children.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750829","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.865968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.806779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.461139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.38582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Melbourne Cricket Ground","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground"},{"name":"High-Level Data Link Control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
