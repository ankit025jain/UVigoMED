{"id":36644,"title":"Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus: past, present and future.","abstract":"This review aims to describe the past history, present techniques and future directions in transcatheter treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Transcatheter PDA closure is the standard of care in most cases and PDA closure is indicated in any patient with signs of left ventricular volume overload due to a ductus. In cases of left-to-right PDA with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, closure may be performed under specific conditions. The management of clinically silent or very tiny PDAs remains highly controversial. Techniques have evolved and the transcatheter approach to PDA closure is now feasible and safe with current devices. Coils and the Amplatzer Duct Occluder are used most frequently for PDA closure worldwide, with a high occlusion rate and few complications. Transcatheter PDA closure in preterm or low-bodyweight infants remains a highly challenging procedure and further device and catheter design development is indicated before transcatheter closure is the treatment of choice in this delicate patient population. The evolution of transcatheter PDA closure from just 40 years ago with 18F sheaths to device delivery via a 3F sheath is remarkable and it is anticipated that further improvements will result in better safety and efficacy of transcatheter PDA closure techniques.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560920","annotations":[{"name":"Patent ductus arteriosus","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.834958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Ductus arteriosus","weight":0.744811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.729313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.722296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.531229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.387979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.368677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.307549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.204122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypervolemia","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervolemia"},{"name":"Personal digital assistant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Coil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coil"},{"name":"Silent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
