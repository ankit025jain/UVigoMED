{"id":27540,"title":"Growth differentiation factor 15, ischemia modified albumin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A in patients with coronary artery disease.","abstract":"Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), ischemia modified albumin (IMA) might aid in the early diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), while pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) can serve as a useful marker of vulnerable plaques and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We sought to determine serum levels of GDF-15, IMA, PAPP-A and evaluate their diagnostic value in different types of CAD.We detected serum levels of GDF-15, IMA and PAPP-A in 348 patients with CAD and 205 controls. Levels of high-sensitivity C reactive protein, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T, which represent biomarkers of inflammation, damage or necrosis, were also evaluated.There were significant differences of GDF-15, IMA and PAPP-A in patients with CAD compared with the controls, where GDF-15 seemed to be associated with severity of CAD. GDF-15 demonstrated a sensitivity of 84.0% and specificity of 84.8% for diagnosis of UAP, while the negative predictive value was 87.4%. The sensitivity and specificity, negative predictive value of IMA in the diagnosis of UAP were 70.0%, 69.5%, and 70.0%, respectively. PAPP-A had the lowest sensitivity and negative predictive value compared with other markers.GDF-15 demonstrated a significant improvement in earlier prediction and assessment of overall patient risk of UAP comparing to IMA and PAPP-A.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016703","annotations":[{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Acute coronary syndrome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_coronary_syndrome"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.862549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Isozyme","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isozyme"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.777237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Blood proteins","weight":0.764848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_proteins"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.74359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.652751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.401066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.231061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Growth differentiation factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_differentiation_factor"},{"name":"Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy-associated_plasma_protein_A"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"American Cancer Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
