{"id":47194,"title":"Devil's claw root: ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding?","abstract":"Harpagophytum procumbens, or devil's claw, is an African plant whose root is used to relieve minor joint symptoms. Several cases of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of devil's claw root have been reported. A systematic review of the adverse effects of devil's claw root in about 20 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials showed mainly gastrointestinal effects: gastralgia and dyspepsia. In practice, devil's claw root exposes patients to the risk of sometimes serious upper gastrointestinal disorders, yet has no established efficacy beyond a placebo effect. It is best avoided.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600731","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Placebo effect","weight":0.775485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo_effect"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.722247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.703722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.622487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.594348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.354027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.306826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Harpagophytum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpagophytum"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Demon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon"},{"name":"Claw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
