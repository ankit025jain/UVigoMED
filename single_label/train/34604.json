{"id":34604,"title":"A single misstep in cardiac development explains the co-occurrence of tetralogy of fallot and complete atrioventricular septal defect in Down syndrome.","abstract":"Tetralogy of Fallot and a complete atrioventricular septal defect are thought to arise by distinct mechanisms, yet their co-occurrence is a recognized association. Analysis of the prevalence of co-occurrence in Down syndrome suggests a common developmental basis. Trisomy 21 may perturb cardiac progenitor cells before they enter the heart tube.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721467","annotations":[{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.637549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.508618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Atrioventricular septal defect","weight":0.42343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.124458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Tetralogy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy"},{"name":"Trisomy 21","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy_21"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Atrioventricular node","weight":0.0208776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_node"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Perturbation (astronomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"}]}
