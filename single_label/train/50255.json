{"id":50255,"title":"[Serum levels of endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide-II in type 2 diabetes mellitus].","abstract":"Endothelial dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of macrovascular complications of diabetes and atherosclerosis. Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide-II (EMAP-II) is a multifunctional polypeptide with proinflammatory and antiangiogenic activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum level of EMAP-II in obese and nonobese patients with type 2 diabetes. We found an increase of serum level of EMAP-II in obese diabetic patients compared to obese subjects without diabetes. Similar alterations were observed also in non-obese diabetic patients compared to control subjects. Moreover, it was significant elevation of serum EMAP-II in obese patients without diabetes compared to control subjects. In obese and non-obese patients with diabetes it was a significant correlation between HbAc1, blood glucose, body mass index and levels of EMAP-II, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides and EMAP-II. In obese non-diabetic patients it was significant correlation between BMI, triglycerides, total cholesterol and EMAP-II. The revealed change of EMAP-II serum level reflects an endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and obesity appear to be significant factors contributing to elevation of EMAP-II level.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809179","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.641556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endothelial dysfunction","weight":0.41898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelial_dysfunction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.401318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
