{"id":79135,"title":"[Application of electric coagulation treatment via bronchoscopy in the management of congenital vallecular cyst in children].","abstract":"To discuss the effect of electric coagulation through bronchoscopy in diagnosis and treatment of congenital vallecular cyst in children.Ten cases of congenital vallecular cyst in the study with age ranged from 21 days to 4 years and 10 months were treated with electric coagulation through bronchoscopy. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by endoscopic and clinical manifestation. And all the patients were followed-up for 6-12 months.All the patients obtained 3-5 times electric coagulation. After the operation, the cyst decreased in size, epiglottis softening was subsided, uplift uncompression, dyspnea and laryngeal stridor were improved obviously. After follow-up periods of 6-12 months, no capsule wall were left, and the activity of the epiglottis resumed.No severe complication was found in any patient.Electric coagulation through bronchoscopy is a simple, effective and safe method to treat congenital vallecular cyst in children.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484560","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.660011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.652446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Epiglottis","weight":0.317693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiglottis"},{"name":"Stridor","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridor"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Tectonic uplift","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_uplift"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"}]}
