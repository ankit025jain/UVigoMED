{"id":89061,"title":"Oral, jaw, and neck injury in infants and children: from abusive trauma or intubation?","abstract":"The objective of this study was to identify the incidence of oral, jaw, and neck injury secondary to endotracheal intubation in young children.This prospective observational study was conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit at a level 1 trauma center. From October 1998 to January 1999 and November 2007 to April 2008, all intubated patients younger than 3 years with no prior oral procedures were examined within 24 hours of intubation. A standardized form was used to record injuries. Separately, medical records were reviewed for prior injuries. Chi-square/Fisher exact test was used for statistical analysis.Of 105 patients included in the study, 12 had oral, jaw, or neck injury. One patient had a hard palate injury from a pen cap in his mouth during a seizure. Another broke a tooth biting the laryngoscope blade (the only injury directly attributable to intubation). The remaining 10 patients were determined to be those who experienced abusive trauma. The overall incidence of injury directly from intubation was 0.9%. Oral, jaw, and neck injuries were all significantly associated with abusive trauma (P < 0.001). Eleven patients had difficult intubations: 9 had no injuries, 1 experienced abusive trauma and the second was the patient who broke his tooth during intubation.Oral, jaw, or neck injury in young children is rarely caused by endotracheal intubation, regardless of difficulty during the procedure.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24759489","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.816307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.780078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.511358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.479186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.329167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.301251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Hard palate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_palate"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Domestic violence","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"}]}
