{"id":13794,"title":"Post-exposure efficacy of oral T-705 (Favipiravir) against inhalational Ebola virus infection in a mouse model.","abstract":"Filoviruses cause disease with high case fatality rates and are considered biological threat agents. Licensed post-exposure therapies that can be administered by the oral route are desired for safe and rapid distribution and uptake in the event of exposure or outbreaks. Favipiravir or T-705 has broad antiviral activity and has already undergone phase II and is undergoing phase III clinical trials for influenza. Here we report the first use of T-705 against Ebola virus. T-705 gave 100% protection against aerosol Ebola virus E718 infection; protection was shown in immune-deficient mice after 14 days of twice-daily dosing. T-705 was also shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection in cell culture. T-705 is likely to be licensed for use against influenza in the near future and could also be used with a new indication for filovirus infection.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462697","annotations":[{"name":"Ebola","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.66628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.467217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Aerosol","weight":0.446188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.361966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.216904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.158969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.153709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Filoviridae","weight":0.104468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filoviridae"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"License","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"}]}
