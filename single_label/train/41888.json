{"id":41888,"title":"Hepatitis C virus infection and coronary artery disease risk: a systematic review of the literature.","abstract":"While hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been implicated in increasing the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), conflicting reports exist regarding this association. We performed a systematic review to further investigate this association.We conducted a PubMed search of original research articles from January 1, 1995 to June 30, 2013 to identify case-control and cohort studies evaluating the association between HCV and CAD using keyword terms [\"hepatitis c\" or \"HCV\"] and [\"coronary artery disease\" or \"heart disease\" or \"atherosclerosis.\"] The primary CAD-related endpoints included myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, need for coronary artery bypass grafting, or transluminal percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Binary outcomes are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI).We identified five studies (four cohort studies and one case-control study) that met our inclusion criteria. A significant association between HCV and CAD was demonstrated in one cohort study (adjusted HR 1.27; 95 % CI 1.22-1.31). One cohort study demonstrated a decreased risk of CAD associated with HCV (adjusted OR 0.74; 95 % CI 0.71-0.76). The remaining studies did not find a significant association between HCV and risk of CAD.The current systematic review demonstrates that the association between HCV and CAD remains unclear. We need more large, long-term cohort studies with clear definitions of patient population and endpoints to better ascertain the association between HCV and CAD.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894512","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.837399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.701656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.587777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.577153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.484672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.436135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.39943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.285023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.225719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"}]}
