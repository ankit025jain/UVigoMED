{"id":34520,"title":"Pregnancy and delivery in women with Pompe disease.","abstract":"The obstetric risk in patients with Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II), a mainly skeletal muscle disorder, is unknown.The clinical course and the outcome of pregnancy, and the effect of pregnancy on disease manifestations or clinical signs and symptoms in Pompe disease were analyzed retrospectively using a questionnaire. Participating women with Pompe disease were recruited by the German and the UK sections of the International Pompe Association, and by centers associated within the German Pompe Group. The data was compared with information from the German statistical almanac, perinatal registry, and perinatal quality survey.66 of 136 women responded to the questionnaire (median age: 47 years, range: 18-74). In 10 of 52 women who had been pregnant, the symptoms of Pompe disease were present during pregnancy (n=7 1st, n=1 2nd, n=1 3rd pregnancy). Muscle weakness worsened in 3 women, and first presented in 3 others during the first pregnancy (4.5% each). Respiratory problems deteriorated in 2/10 women during pregnancy. These 10 symptomatic women had 17 pregnancies (15 deliveries, 2 miscarriages, no abortions). The 42 asymptomatic women (63.6%) had 109 pregnancies (72.4% deliveries, 19.3% miscarriages, 7.3% abortions). There were no significant differences between the mean duration of pregnancies or the mean birth weight in symptomatic and asymptomatic women, or compared to the data from the general population. The same was true of pregnancy and delivery complications (including Cesarean section).Our data show that women with Pompe disease do not appear to have an increased risk of pregnancy or delivery complications. However, muscle weakness and respiratory complications might manifest or worsen during pregnancy in some women.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726296","annotations":[{"name":"Glycogen","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"},{"name":"Glycogen storage disease","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_storage_disease"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.777127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.408618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.273347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.153002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Almanac","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
