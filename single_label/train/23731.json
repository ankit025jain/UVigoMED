{"id":23731,"title":"Candida famata-induced fulminating cholecystitis.","abstract":"Lithiasic cholecystitis is classically associated with the presence of enterobacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter, in the gallbladder. Cholecystitis associated with fungal infections is a rare event related to underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus, steroid use, and broad-spectrum antibiotic use for prolonged periods, as well as pancreatitis and surgery of the digestive tract. Here, we present the first reported case of a gallbladder infection caused by Candida famata.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474028","annotations":[{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.775131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Enterobacter","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacter"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.189179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.117504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Anabolic steroid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid"}]}
