{"id":54101,"title":"Serum interleukin-23 (IL-23) is increased in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.","abstract":"Recent studies have demonstrated that T-helper 17 lymphocytes (Th17), which produce mostly IL-17, play a major role in several autoimmune diseases commonly thought to be Th1-related, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). IL-23, a member of the IL-12 cytokine family, is known to guide T cells toward the Th17 phenotype and its serum levels are increased in several autoimmune disease. Few data are available in the literature on IL-23 in HT. Using IL-23 Quantikine ELISA Kit (lower limit of detection 2.7 pg/mL) we analyzed the serum levels of IL-23 in 81 HT patients (75 females and 6 males, aged 14-70; mean age 39±17 years), and an age- and sex-matched group of 80 healthy persons. Both patients and controls did not receive any treatment. The positive detection rates of serum IL-23 were significantly higher in patients with HT: 56% of HT patients had detectable IL-23 in serum compared to 36% of healthy subjects (Chi ?² test, p=0.014). Moreover, HT patients had significantly higher serum concentrations of IL-23 (157.38 ± 17.92 pg/mL) in comparison with healthy controls (21.46 ± 5.4 pg/mL; p <0.0001). No significant correlation was found between serum levels of IL-23 and Tg-Ab or TPO-Ab levels, as well as with TSH values, in HT patients. In conclusion, serum IL-23 is increased in euthyroid and untreated HT patients, as compared to healthy subjects. Our data suggest that IL-23 would play a role in the pathogenesis of HT.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476945","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.873192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.809475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.807432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.719717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.696126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.457828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.34386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Thyroiditis","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroiditis"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Euthyroid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyroid"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"1470","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1470"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
