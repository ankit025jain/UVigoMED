This study was designed to determine whether heterogeneous echogenicity of the thyroid parenchyma influences the diagnostic performance of US in the detection of multi-focality in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Between December 2010 and April 2011, 811 patients underwent pre-operative staging US for papillary thyroid carcinoma and surgery. Twelve radiologists performed the pre-operative US for T and N staging. Underlying parenchymal echogenicity and unilateral and bilateral multi-focality of the thyroid nodules were also evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the underlying echogenicity of the thyroid gland. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of US with respect to underlying echogenicity, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were calculated and compared between the two groups. Among the 811 patients included, US revealed underlying heterogeneous echogenicity of the thyroid parenchyma in 204 (25.2%) and underlying homogeneous echogenicity of the thyroid parenchyma in 607 (74.8%). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the diagnostic performance of pre-operative staging US in predicting unilateral multi-focality and bilaterality. Underlying heterogeneous echogenicity in a thyroid gland with Hashimoto's thyroiditis does not significantly influence the detection of multi-focality in papillary thyroid cancer on pre-operative US staging.
