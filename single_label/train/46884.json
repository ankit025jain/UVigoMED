{"id":46884,"title":"Tumor-associated mesothelial cells are negative prognostic factors in gastric cancer and promote peritoneal dissemination of adherent gastric cancer cells by chemotaxis.","abstract":"Peritoneal dissemination is highly frequent in gastric cancer. Damage to human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC) barriers provokes gastric cancer peritoneal dissemination (GCPD), the key events during GCPD, is characterized by fibroblastic development. In this study, we have studied the association between fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression in peritoneum and the pathological features of the primary tumor. The clinical prognosis of gastric cancer patients was evaluated according to FAP expression. In a gastric cancer cell-HPMC co-culture system, expression of E-cadherin, ?-smooth muscle actin, and FAP were evaluated by Western blotting. Gastric cancer cell migration and adhesion to HPMC were also assayed. Our results showed positive peritoneal staining of FAP in 36/86 cases (41.9 %), which was associated with a higher TNM stage in primary gastric cancer and higher incidence of GCPD (both p<0.05). Survival analysis showed FAP expression was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (p=0.02). Peritoneum of FAP-positive expression exhibited a distinct fibrotic development and expressed higher level of the mesenchymal marker ?-SMA, which was confirmed by the in vitro Western blot assay. In HPMC and gastric cancer cell adherence assay, SGC-7901 cells preferentially adhered to TA-HPMC at different cell densities (both p<0.05). Additionally, SGC-7901 cells were more prone to chemotaxis by FAP-expressed tumor-associated-human peritoneal mesothelial cells (TA-HPMC) compared with HPMC co-cultured with normal gastric glandular epithelial cells in a time-dependent manner (both p<0.05). Our study indicated a positive correlation between peritoneum FAP expression and GCPD. FAP-expressed TA-HPMC might be an important cellular component and instigator of GCPD.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615523","annotations":[{"name":"Mesothelium","weight":0.920421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelium"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.90179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.888734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.812169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.63852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.614568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.508178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.451722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.375049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.332067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Goblet cell","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_cell"},{"name":"Familial adenomatous polyposis","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_adenomatous_polyposis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.170315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
