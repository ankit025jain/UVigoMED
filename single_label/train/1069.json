{"id":1069,"title":"A comparison of the effects of lidocaine or magnesium sulfate on hemodynamic response and QT dispersion related with intubation in patients with hypertension.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of magnesium administered before induction on the hemodynamic response and QT dispersion (QTd) related with intubation in hypertensive patients and to compare it with lidocaine.Patients with essential hypertension who were under ? 65 years old, scheduled for elective surgery with a Mallampati score of I-II were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups; group M (n = 20) received magnesium sulfate, group L was prescribed lidocaine, and group C (control group) received saline. Standard 12-lead ECG readings were taken before the induction of anesthesia and at the first and fifth minutes following intubation.There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of age, sex and demographic characteristics. There was no significant difference in the QT interval values before induction and 5 minutes after intubation in all groups. In group M, QTd values were significantly lower at the first and fifth minutes than before induction. There were no statistically significant differences in QTd values at different times in group L and group C.QTd is not increased during tracheal intubation in hypertensive patients so there is no need for magnesium sulfate for these patients. But as QTd has been shown to increase during tracheal intubation for coronary artery disease patients, magnesium sulfate might be useful for those patients although future studies are required to confirm this statement.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470888","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Lidocaine","weight":0.792817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.705566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Magnesium sulfate","weight":0.545374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.495274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.47983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.449902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.416057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.367249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Essential hypertension","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_hypertension"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.227483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.168432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Elective surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
