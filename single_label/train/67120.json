{"id":67120,"title":"Mirabegron in the treatment of overactive bladder.","abstract":"Mirabegron is a selective ?3-adrenergic receptor agonist recently developed for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder (OAB), which offers an alternative pharmacological option to the well-established treatment with antimuscarinics (AMs).This review offers an explanation of the mechanism of action, of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mirabegron and gives readers a complete overview of Phase II and III studies on the clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety of this agent in the setting of OAB treatment.Both Phase II and III trials have shown that mirabegron is efficacious and safe in treating patients with OAB. Future research should focus on the assessment of mirabegron concentrations in the CNS and on the evaluation of the potential of the combination of mirabegron with AMs. Another field for future research is represented by the investigation of the interaction of mirabegron with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Furthermore, current literature completely lacks studies on the efficacy and safety of mirabegron in the pediatric population and such trials are awaited.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646053","annotations":[{"name":"CYP2D6","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.82664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.641068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.430081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.389381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Member of the National Assembly for Wales","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Adrenergic agonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_agonist"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Order of Attorneys of Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Attorneys_of_Brazil"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
