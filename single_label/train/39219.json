{"id":39219,"title":"Protective effect of Dillenia indica L. on acetic acid induced colitis in mice.","abstract":"The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic, immune mediated and chronic inflammation of the intestine. The study aimed to elucidate the ameliorative effect of methanolic extract of Dillenia indica (DIME), hexane fraction (HFDI) and chloroform fraction (CFDI) of Dillenia indica in acetic acid induced experimental colitis in mice. Macroscopic score, colon weight, colonic catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and histological changes were recorded after the treatment regimen of 7 days. Intra-rectal instillation of acetic acid caused enhanced macroscopic score, colon weight, colonic MPO, MDA, and TNF-alpha level. It caused significant decreased level of CAT, SOD and GSH. DIME (800 mg/kg), HFDI (200 mg/kg) and CFDI (200 mg/kg) treatment exhibited significant effect in lowering macroscopic score, colon weight, MPO, MDA, TNF-alpha levels and elevation of CAT, GSH and SOD levels. The results suggest that D. indica has ameliorating effects on experimental colitis by inhibiting the proinflammatory mediators like TNF-alpha production.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241587","annotations":[{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.891683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.881272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Chloroform","weight":0.84505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.800683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.779367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.668902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.422255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.269757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.16612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Hexane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexane"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Cannabis sativa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_sativa"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Immune-mediated disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune-mediated_disease"},{"name":"Instillation abortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instillation_abortion"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
