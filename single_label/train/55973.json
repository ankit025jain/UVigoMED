{"id":55973,"title":"Long-term efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty in patients on prostaglandin therapy.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to analyse the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty in patients on medical therapy and to evaluate a possible influence of prostaglandin therapy on intraocular pressure reduction.A retrospective chart review was undertaken of patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma who underwent selective laser trabeculoplasty between 3/2008 and 12/2010. Data were collected preoperatively, on the day of intervention, 1 day, 1 month and then every 3 months post selective laser trabeculoplasty. The main outcome measure was mean intraocular pressure reduction.109 eyes (76 on prostaglandins) were included. Mean preoperative intraocular pressure was 22.3 ± 4.5 mmHg (prostaglandin naïve) and 19.2 ± 4.8 mmHg (on prostaglandin) (p=0.003). Up to 1 year follow-up, intraocular pressure was statistically significantly reduced in both groups (p ? 0.019). Eyes with a higher preoperative intraocular pressure had a greater pressure reduction (Spearman rho=0.387, p=0.002). Eyes naïve to prostaglandins initially had a greater reduction in intraocular pressure, although after 1 year of follow-up the difference was no longer statistically significant.Selective laser trabeculoplasty significantly reduces intraocular pressure in patients already on medical therapy. A sustained influence of prostaglandin therapy on the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty was not found.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771166","annotations":[{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.593047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.584048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.516945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.473852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.325845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.319585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ocular hypertension","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_hypertension"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0560117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Nave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Pressure flaking","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_flaking"},{"name":"Rho","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho"},{"name":"Spearman, Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman,_Texas"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
