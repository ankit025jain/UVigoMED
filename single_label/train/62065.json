{"id":62065,"title":"ApoptomiRs expression modulated by BCR-ABL is linked to CML progression and imatinib resistance.","abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the presence of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) leading to expression of a BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene. The BCR-ABL protein has a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which is responsible for CML pathogenesis by promoting cell apoptosis resistance; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with BCR-ABL expression and apoptosis impairment in CML leukemic cells have not been fully elucidated.This study evaluated apoptomiRs and their predicted apoptotic genes in BCR-ABL(+) cells from patients in different phases of CML treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) according to their imatinib (IM) response by qPCR. Phosphotyrosine and c-ABL expressions in HL-60.BCR-ABL cells treated with TKI were done by Western blot.We found that dasatinib (DAS) modulated miR-let-7d, miR-let-7e, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-21, miR-130a and miR-142-3p expressions while IM modulated miR-15a and miR-130a levels. miR-16, miR-130a and miR-145 expressions were modulated by nilotinib (NIL). We observed higher miR-15a, miR-130b and miR-145; and lower miR-16, miR-26a and miR-146a expressions in CML-CP in comparison with controls. CML-AP patients showed low miR-let-7d, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-29c, miR-142-3p, miR-145, and miR-146a levels in comparison with CML-CP. We noted that the miR-26a, miR-29c, miR-130b and miR-146a expressions were downregulated in IM resistant patients in comparison with IM responsive patients.This study showed the modulation of apoptomiRs by BCR-ABL kinase activity and the deregulation of apoptomiRs and their predicted apoptotic target genes in different CML phases and after treatment with TK inhibitors. ApoptomiRs may be involved in the BCR-ABL(+) cell apoptosis regulation.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629639","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Philadelphia chromosome","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_chromosome"},{"name":"Myeloproliferative disease","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloproliferative_disease"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.855512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nilotinib","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilotinib"},{"name":"Dasatinib","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.799718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.711061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.619642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.564734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.327665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.274121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.215641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Philadelphia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"}]}
