Three studies were reviewed, evaluated, and summarized. The etiology and pathogenesis, pattern differentiation, medicine administration, and combination of TCM with Western Medicine were all examined.TCM had an advantage in treating OAS and had fewer adverse events than conventional treatments.Although TCM has an advantage in treating OAS and fewer adverse events, the efficacy of TCM and modern medicine on OAS is unsatisfactory.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417415","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.569005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.537535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"China","weight":0.450918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.423861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.331777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Narrative","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Organization of American States","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"}]}
