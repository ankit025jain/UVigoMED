{"id":30729,"title":"Downregulation of the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway is involved in manganese-induced neurotoxicity in rat striatum and PC12 cells.","abstract":"Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element. However, exposure to excessive Mn may cause neurodegenerative disorders called manganism. Accumulating evidence indicated that dysregulation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling was tightly associated with the onset of neurodegenerative disorders. However, whether aberrant Wnt/?-catenin signaling contributes to Mn-induced neurotoxicity remains unknown. The present study investigates the involvement of Wnt/?-catenin signaling in Mn-induced neurotoxicity. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses showed a remarkable downregulation of p-Ser9-glycogen synthase kinase-3? (GSK-3?) and ?-catenin in rat striatum after Mn exposure. TUNEL assay revealed significant neuronal apoptosis following treatment with 25 mg/kg Mn. Immunofluorescent staining showed that ?-catenin was expressed predominantly in neurons, and colocalization of ?-catenin and active caspase-3 was observed after Mn exposure. Furthermore, Mn exposure resulted in PC12 cells apoptosis, which was accompanied by reduced levels of cellular ?-catenin and p-GSK-3?. Accordingly, the mRNA level of the prosurvival factor survivin, a downstream target gene of ?-catenin, was synchronously decreased. More importantly, blockage of GSK-3? activity with the GSK-3? inhibitor lithium chloride could attenuate Mn-induced downregulation of ?-catenin and survivin as well as neuronal apoptosis. Overall, the present study demonstrates that downregulation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway may be of vital importance in the neuropathological process of Mn-induced neurotoxicity.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464479","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.941928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.928136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Glycogen","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.745549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.702153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.654331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Lithium","weight":0.575104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.560295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.558538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.501856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Manganese","weight":0.500503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"},{"name":"GSK-3","weight":0.491033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSK-3"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.464248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.314179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"GlaxoSmithKline","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline"},{"name":"Glycogen synthase","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_synthase"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Neuropathology","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Trace element","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_element"},{"name":"Lithium chloride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_chloride"},{"name":"Manganism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganism"},{"name":"PC12 cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC12_cell"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
