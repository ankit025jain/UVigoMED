{"id":91482,"title":"Classification tree analysis of the factors influencing injury-related disability caused by the Wenchuan earthquake.","abstract":"To identify the factors that influenced the risk of injury-related disability caused by the Wenchuan earthquake.A chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) classification tree analysis was used to retrospectively analyse clinical data from patients who underwent surgical treatment for earthquake-related injuries in the first 5 days after the earthquake. The CHAID classification tree explored the relationships between the development of disability and potential influencing factors including sex, age, time interval between injury and treatment, wound type, preoperative and postoperative haemoglobin levels, and operation time.A total of 334 patients underwent surgery; of these, 113 (33.8%) were discharged with varying degrees of permanent disability. The CHAID classification tree showed that children (? 17 years old), a long time interval between injury and treatment, an open wound and a low preoperative haemoglobin level were significant risk factors for disability.The results of this study can help to stratify patients according to their medical needs and to help allocate the available resources efficiently to ensure the best outcomes for injured patients during future earthquakes.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501163","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.673563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.515544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.478888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.278431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.121231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Decision tree learning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning"},{"name":"CHAID","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAID"},{"name":"2008 Sichuan earthquake","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Total permanent disability insurance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_permanent_disability_insurance"},{"name":"Stratification (water)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_(water)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Wenchuan County","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchuan_County"}]}
