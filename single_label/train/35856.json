{"id":35856,"title":"Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome: LIFR and associated cytokines in clinical course and etiology.","abstract":"Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome (STWS; OMIM #610559) is a rare bent-bone dysplasia that includes radiologic bone anomalies, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and hyperthermic episodes. STWS usually results in infant mortality, yet some STWS patients survive into and, in some cases, beyond adolescence. STWS is caused by a mutation in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) gene, which is inherited in an autosomally recessive pattern. Most LIFR mutations resulting in STWS are null mutations which cause instability of the mRNA and prevent the formation of LIFR, impairing the signaling pathway. LIFR signaling usually follows the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and is initiated by several interleukin-6-type cytokines. STWS is managed on a symptomatic basis since there is no treatment currently available.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618404","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.823166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.77158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.740189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.739684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.643164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.633355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.565585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.538815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.531806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.491594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.487436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.477993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Mendelian_Inheritance_in_Man"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.289636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.238896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Infant mortality","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"},{"name":"Leukemia inhibitory factor","weight":0.0961346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia_inhibitory_factor"},{"name":"Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia_inhibitory_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Null allele","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_allele"}]}
