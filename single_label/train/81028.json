{"id":81028,"title":"Radiologic findings and percutaneous treatment of a rare giant soft tissue hydatid cyst.","abstract":"The aim of this report is to present the radiologic findings and discuss the percutaneous treatment of an extremely rare giant soft tissue hydatid cyst located in the left thigh in a 44-year-old woman. Ultrasound showed a well circumscribed giant soft tissue cyst, and computed tomography revealed a well defined unilocular hypodense cystic mass originating from the adductor muscles and extending through the subcutaneous tissue without bony relations. On magnetic resonance imaging, the cystic mass was hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Percutaneous treatment was performed successfully by catheterization technique with hypertonic saline and alcohol. No complications and recurrence were observed during the procedure, in the postprocedure or in the follow up period.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479288","annotations":[{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.796656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.726553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.48578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
