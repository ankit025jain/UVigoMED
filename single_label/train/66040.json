{"id":66040,"title":"Can we deliver randomized trials of focal therapy in prostate cancer?","abstract":"Tissue-preserving focal therapies, such as brachytherapy, cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound and photodynamic therapy, aim to target individual cancer lesions rather than the whole prostate. These treatments have emerged as potential interventions for localized prostate cancer to reduce treatment-related adverse-effects associated with whole-gland treatments, such as radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy. In this article, the Prostate Cancer RCT Consensus Group propose that a novel cohort-embedded randomized controlled trial (RCT) would provide a means to study men with clinically significant localized disease, which we defined on the basis of PSA level (? 15 ng/ml or ? 20 ng/ml), Gleason grade (Gleason pattern ? 4 + 4 or ? 4 + 3) and stage (? cT2cN0M0). This RCT should recruit men who stand to benefit from treatment, with the control arm being whole-gland surgery or radiotherapy. Composite outcomes measuring rates of local and systemic salvage therapies at 3-5 years might best constitute the basis of the primary outcome on which to change practice.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751803","annotations":[{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Cryotherapy","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.786849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"High-intensity focused ultrasound","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_focused_ultrasound"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.605656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.5385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.452344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.222903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"}]}
