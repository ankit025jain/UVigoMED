{"id":72097,"title":"[Advanced radiation therapy project for cancer treatment--from Hokkaido to the world, the world access to Hokkaido].","abstract":"Cancer is the most major cause of death in Japan recently. In this symposium, we explained advanced treatment technology for cancer treatment, now used and that will be used in near future at the Hokkaido University Hospital. Intensity Moderated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) are considered to be the most promising and advanced technologies for cancer treatment. Various kinds of radiation treatment equipment and methods have been developed and constructed at the Hokkaido University. One of the most worlds wide famous one is the real time tumor tracking radiotherapy system. The FIRST (Funding for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology) Program has been supporting us to produce cutting-edge technology. We hope that this symposium would help the audience to understand the latest technology for cancer treatment especially in the field of radiation therapy and also we wish the audience would recognize the importance of the research aspect that have been performed at Hokkaido University and its Hospital.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000814","annotations":[{"name":"Proton therapy","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.569077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.237763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.118291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Hokkaido University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido_University"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Chord (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)"},{"name":"Moderation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Symposium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Audience","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience"},{"name":"For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Inspiration_and_Recognition_of_Science_and_Technology"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Hokkaido","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Telemetry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
