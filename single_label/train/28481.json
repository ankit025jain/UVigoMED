{"id":28481,"title":"Improving treatment for opioid dependence: a perspective from the Ohio Valley node of the NIDA Clinical Trials Network.","abstract":"Rates of adoption of evidenced-based practices, including the use of medications, to treat opioid dependence are low and severely limit secondary prevention efforts to curtail the prescription drug epidemic.The goal of this article was to describe how involvement in a research clinical trials network (CTN) facilitated the adoption of medications to treat opioid dependence at two community-based treatment programs (CTPs) affiliated with the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA) CTN.Participation in a CTN may facilitate adoption by providing the infrastructure for trialability and observability, but the most critical function may be the knowledge translation that occurs through the individual-level professional relationships that develop.Community-based treatment providers' involvement in research networks may increase the rate of evidence-based practice (EBP) adoption and improve outcomes for patients with opioid dependence.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859107","annotations":[{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.761432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.729816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.704189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.682831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.641477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.624215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Ohio","weight":0.281677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.108815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"National Institute on Drug Abuse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Drug_Abuse"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Observability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability"},{"name":"Crack epidemic (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_epidemic_(United_States)"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Ohio Country","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Country"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Emopamil binding protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emopamil_binding_protein"}]}
