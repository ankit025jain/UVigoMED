{"id":68799,"title":"[Epidemiologic study of the risk factors of the adult female urinary incontinence in Uygur of Kashi in Xinjiang].","abstract":"To evaluate the prevalence and associated risk factors of stress urinary incontinence(SUI) in adult women in Xinjiang.In the cross-sectional study, 3403 Uygur women aged over 20 years were interviewed through a questionnaire of International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Module (ICIQ-FLUTS) and the adult questionnaire were used in our research. All parts of the content were according to the characteristics of women in Xinjiang and the purpose of our research. The risk factors were studied by Logistic regression analysis.The prevalence of urinary incontinence(UI) was 41.96% (1428/3403) and 28.21% (960/3403) of SUI in Uygur women. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factors of SUI are body mass index (OR = 1.672, 95%CI:1.082-2.584), parity (OR = 5.092, 95%CI:3.889-6.666), neonatal birth weight (OR = 5.623, 95%CI:3.335-9.480), the mode of delivery (OR = 2.247, 95%CI:1.634-3.090), the lateral episiotomy (OR = 4.448, 95%CI:3.112-6.357), menopause(OR = 5.145, 95%CI: 3.613-7.328), chronic pelvic pain (OR = 3.869, 95%CI:1.051-14.250), pelvic organ prolapse (OR = 3.501, 95%CI:2.508-4.887).The incidence of SUI is related with multiple factors, especially with obesity and the obstetric factor.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495685","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.868302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.701987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.58647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Pelvic pain","weight":0.550086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_pain"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.540941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.509879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Episiotomy","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.381756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.224285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.12306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"}]}
