{"id":92771,"title":"Juvenile xanthogranuloma: diverse presentations of noncutaneous disease.","abstract":"Juvenile xanthogranulomas (JXGs) are benign cutaneous lesions of childhood that often spontaneously involute. They rarely present as a noncutaneous tumors. However, JXG tumors have been described in numerous noncutaneous anatomic sites, presenting with a variety of symptoms. The severity of symptoms and accurate preoperative diagnosis of JXG should determine operative and nonoperative treatment options of these uncommon, benign, and self-limiting tumors. We report 3 cases of symptomatic, noncutaneous JXG from disparate anatomic sites all treated with aggressive surgical resection.
