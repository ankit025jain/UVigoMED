{"id":55537,"title":"Survey of intravitreal injection techniques and treatment protocols among retina specialists in Canada.","abstract":"To describe intravitreal injection (IVI) techniques and treatment protocols by retina specialists in Canada from August 1, 2012, to October 1, 2012.Cross-sectional survey.All fellowship-trained retina specialists across Canada, as identified from the Canadian Ophthalmological Society directory and the Canadian Retina and Vitreous Society directory.An anonymous 28-question survey was sent to 125 retina specialists across Canada by email. Reminder letters were sent by email, mail, and fax as necessary.A total of 75 (63%) retina specialists responded to the survey. Most IVIs were performed in the office. Most surgeons did not use gloves (61%), sterile draping (91%), or surgical mask (71%). Antisepsis was used on conjunctiva by 100% and on periocular skin by 48%. Nearly all specialists used a sterile lid speculum (91%). Common anaesthetics included topical proparacaine or lidocaine drops (90%), topical lidocaine gel (25%), topical pledget (23%), and subconjunctival lidocaine injections (23%). Most (83%) dilate the pupil before IVI. Prophylactic topical antibiotics were used by 43%; 50% of these were started immediately after IVI. Injection location was estimated by visualization by 45%. A majority (63%) inject inferotemporally. Anterior chamber paracentesis was performed routinely by 5%. Optic nerve perfusion was formally assessed by 48%. The most common treatment protocol for age-related macular degeneration was treat and extend. For both diabetic and retinal vein occlusion-related macular edema, the most common protocol was 3 initial monthly injections with PRN follow-up.A wide variety of IVI practice patterns exist in terms of aseptic technique, anaesthetics, prophylactic antibiotics, postinjection monitoring, and treatment protocol.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Eye
