{"id":56144,"title":"Intravitreal aflibercept (Eylea(®)): a review of its use in patients with macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion.","abstract":"Aflibercept is a fully human, recombinant fusion protein that acts as a soluble decoy receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members, including VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placental growth factor (P1GF), thereby inhibiting downstream signalling mediated by these ligands. Aflibercept binds all isoforms of VEGF-A with high affinity, and a markedly higher affinity than that of ranibizumab or bevacizumab. A formulation of aflibercept developed specifically for intravitreal injection (Eylea(®)) is approved for use in several countries for the treatment of patients with macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). In clinical trials (GALILEO and COPERNICUS) in patients with this condition, intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg every month improved best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as measured by the proportion of study eyes with a gain of ?15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters from baseline, significantly more than sham injections at week 24 (primary analysis). The significant improvements achieved with intravitreal aflibercept compared with sham in the first 6 months were maintained in the second 6 months with as-needed (prn) dosing and monthly monitoring. Continued prn dosing with a reduced monitoring frequency was associated with decreased improvements. More data are needed to confirm the optimal monitoring frequency for use with prn dosing, subsequent to initial monthly injections, in order to maintain long-term efficacy. Intravitreal aflibercept was generally well tolerated in clinical trials and there is little potential for systemic drug accumulation. Thus, intravitreal aflibercept is an effective and generally well tolerated agent that extends the options available for the treatment of macular oedema secondary to CRVO.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Eye
