{"id":5430,"title":"Deletion of the ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptors accelerates cutaneous wound healing in mice.","abstract":"The ?2-adrenoceptors regulate the sympathetic nervous system, controlling presynaptic catecholamine release. However, the role of the ?2-adrenoceptors in cutaneous wound healing is poorly understood. Mice lacking both the ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptors were used to evaluate the participation of the ?2-adrenoceptor during cutaneous wound healing. A full-thickness excisional lesion was performed on the dorsal skin of the ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptor knockout and wild-type mice. Seven or fourteen days later, the animals were euthanized and the lesions were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded or frozen. Murine skin fibroblasts were also isolated from ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptor knockout and wild-type mice, and fibroblast activity was evaluated. The in vivo study demonstrated that ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptor depletion accelerated wound contraction and re-epithelialization. A reduction in the number of neutrophils and macrophages was observed in the ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptor knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. In addition, ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptor depletion enhanced the levels of nitrite and hydroxyproline, and the protein expression of transforming growth factor-? and vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptor depletion accelerated blood vessel formation and myofibroblast differentiation. The in vitro study demonstrated that skin fibroblasts isolated from ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptor knockout mice exhibited enhanced cell migration, ?-smooth muscle actin _protein expression and collagen deposition compared with wild-type skin fibroblasts. In conclusion, ?2A/?2C-adrenoceptor deletion accelerates cutaneous wound healing in mice.
