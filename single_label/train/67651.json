{"id":67651,"title":"Transvaginal repair using acellular collagen biomesh for the treatment of anterior prolapse.","abstract":"To determine the results and satisfaction of the patients underwent transvaginal repair of cystocele in our clinic.From January 2006 to October 2010, 15 patients with a mean age of 64 years (ranged 47-85 years) underwent transvaginal cystocele repair using acellular collagen biomesh. The patients were presented with vaginal mass in 10, dyspareunia and urge incontinence in 5 while 4 of them had both stress and urge incontinence. Grade 4 cystocele was determined in 2 patients, grade 3 in 9 and grade 2 in 4. Concomitant transobturator tape (TOT) was performed in 4 patients. Patient satisfactions were determined after the operation.The mean follow-up time was 23.5 (12-60) months. There was no postoperative complication in early follow- up period. Cystocele was recurrent in 1 patient. The success rate was 93.4%. Urinary incontinence was continued in 1 patient after TOT. Nearly all of the patients (14/15) were satisfied from the operation.Transvaginal cystocele repair with using acellular collagen biomesh appears to be a safe and effective method. Further prospective and randomized controlled studies including large series of patients are needed.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595936","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Dyspareunia","weight":0.759715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspareunia"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.41841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.154042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Cystocele","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystocele"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0241801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1415","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1415"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"1260","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1260"},{"name":"Natural satellite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"},{"name":"Fourth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_grade"},{"name":"Second grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_grade"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"TOT S.C.","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOT_S.C."},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Non-cellular life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life"}]}
