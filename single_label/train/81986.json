{"id":81986,"title":"Orthognathic surgery: pretreatment information and patient satisfaction.","abstract":"This study sought to (1) analyze the demographic profile of patients who completed combined orthodontic and surgical treatments at the Kuwait Ministry of Health dental clinics, (2) evaluate the source, type, amount and timing of preoperative patient information, (3) determine posttreatment patient satisfaction and (4) examine whether patient satisfaction is associated with preoperative information.Of the 145 patients who completed combined orthodontic and surgical treatments at least 6 months prior to the initiation of this study, 74 agreed to be interviewed by telephone by means of a structured survey including questions covering the study's objectives.The mean age of participants was 21.1 years; 52 (70.3%) were female and 22 (29.7%) were male. Of these 74 patients, 70 (94%) did not regret their decision to undergo orthognathic surgery and 62 (83.8%) would repeat the same treatment if it was needed. The majority of the respondents reported that the importance of treatment compliance had been explained very well prior to surgery, but that information about the associated functional and social problems was lacking. The orthodontist was the most prominent source of information before treatment began. As the presurgical orthodontic treatment phase progressed, the roles of the surgeon and orthodontist became more evenly distributed.The patients who underwent orthognathic surgery were satisfied and generally well informed. However, information regarding surgical risks and functional discomforts was not adequate. Participants were more likely to be satisfied when they were provided with more information about discomfort and surgical risks.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752213","annotations":[{"name":"Patient","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.740967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.345403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.173181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Orthognathic surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery"},{"name":"Kuwait","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Department of Health (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Social issues","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issues"},{"name":"Regret (emotion)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(emotion)"},{"name":"Ironman 70.3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3"}]}
