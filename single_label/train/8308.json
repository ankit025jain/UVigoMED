{"id":8308,"title":"The protective effect of dietary Arthrospira (Spirulina) maxima against mutagenicity induced by benzo[alpha]pyrene in mice.","abstract":"Benzo[alpha]pyrene (B[?]P) was used to test the possible antimutagenic effects of Arthrospira (Spirulina) maxima (SP) on male and female mice. SP was orally administered at 0, 200, 400, or 800?mg/kg of body weight to animals of both sexes for 2 weeks before starting the B[?]P (intraperitoneal injection) at 125?mg/kg of body weight for 5 consecutive days. For the male dominant lethal test, each male was caged with two untreated females per week for 3 weeks. For the female dominant lethal test, each female was caged for 1 week with one untreated male. All the females were evaluated 13-15 days after mating for incidence of pregnancy, total corpora lutea, total implants and pre- and postimplant losses. SP protected from B[?]P-induced pre- and postimplant losses in the male dominant lethal test, and from B[?]P-induced postimplantation losses in treated females. Moreover, SP treatment significantly reduced the detrimental effect of B[?]P on the quality of mouse semen. Our results illustrate the protective effects of SP in relation to B[?]P-induced genetic damage to germ cells. We conclude that SP, owing mainly to the presence of phycocyanin, could be of potential clinical interest in cancer treatment or prevention of relapse.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24787733","annotations":[{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Corpus luteum","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_luteum"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Mutagen","weight":0.728068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.709322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.691873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.633539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.613181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.314864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.289562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mating","weight":0.177041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Spirulina (dietary supplement)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina_(dietary_supplement)"},{"name":"Phycocyanin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycocyanin"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"}]}
