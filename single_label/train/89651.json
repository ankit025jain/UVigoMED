{"id":89651,"title":"Complex shoulder injuries in sports.","abstract":"A 26-year-old Olympic wrestling athlete presented with a pectoralis major muscle injury, glenohumeral instability and acromioclavicular joint dislocation separately. The patient underwent surgical treatment to repair these injuries. The pectoralis major muscle was reconstructed with a semitendinosus tendon graft using the endobutton technique, as described by Pochini et al. Treatment of the traumatic anterior instability was performed using the technique described by Bristow-Latarjet, and the acromioclavicular joint dislocation was repaired using the modified technique of Weaver-Dunn with the aid of an anchor. The athlete exhibited a rapid recovery and could return to normal activities 6 months after surgery. At present, 18 months postoperatively, the patient is asymptomatic.
