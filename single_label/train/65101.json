{"id":65101,"title":"Durability and complications of photoselective vaporisation of the prostate with the 120W high performance system GreenLight™ lithium triborate laser.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the durability of photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (PVP) with the 120W GreenLight HPS(®) laser (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN, US), and to examine the incidence, nature and factors associated with complications from the procedure.Clinical records of PVP patients were reviewed to compare details between patients who developed complications and those who did not. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess durability. Cox regression was used to examine associations between complications and perioperative factors.Successful outcomes were maintained in 84% of 117 patients at the 2-year follow-up appointment. Complication rates were low and comparable with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Complications were developed by 18 patients (15.4%) over a mean follow-up duration of 20.8 months. The most common complications were residual prostate requiring another surgery (5/117, 4.3%) and urethral stricture (4/117, 3.4%). Patients with complications had significantly longer catheterisation duration. Length of hospital stay, lasing energy, pre and postoperative levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), pre and postoperative maximum flow rate (Qmax), and age at surgery were not found to influence development of complications.Results from PVP with an HPS(®) laser are durable. Complications are low and compare favourably with TURP. Lasing energy, PSA, Qmax, patient age and length of stay are not associated with development of complications. However, a longer postoperative catheterisation after PVP is associated with development of complications.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992419","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.576564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.46932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.441528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.426571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.399276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Lithium","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Minnetonka, Minnesota","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnetonka,_Minnesota"},{"name":"Lithium triborate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_triborate"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Vaporization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporization"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Maximum flow problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Player versus player","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Helsingin Palloseura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingin_Palloseura"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
