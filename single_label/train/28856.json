{"id":28856,"title":"Rapid detoxification of benzodiazepine or Z-drugs dependence using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.","abstract":"Dependence on benzodiazepines (BZDs) or Z-drugs (zolpidem, zopicline and zaleplon) is a common clinical phenomenon. Traditional detoxification of BZDs dependence includes tapering used dose gradually and using equivalent doses of long-acting BZDs as substitutes. This kind of regimen tends to take a long time (up to 4weeks) and may require hospitalization. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been shown to reverse BZDs induced sedation. We propose that oral form acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) also posses the effect of inhibiting GABA receptors, and act as indirect antagonist, to be applied in the rapid detoxification treatment of BZDs and Z-drug dependence.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24774720","annotations":[{"name":"Zolpidem","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolpidem"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Galantamine","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galantamine"},{"name":"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Zaleplon","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaleplon"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rivastigmine","weight":0.677318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivastigmine"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.635772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Donepezil","weight":0.578049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donepezil"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase","weight":0.532117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor","weight":0.354182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.344178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.34323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Detoxification","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"GABA receptor","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Drug detoxification","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_detoxification"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"}]}
