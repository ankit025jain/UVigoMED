{"id":72335,"title":"Prevention of cancer recurrence in tumor margins by stopping microcirculation in the tumor and tumor-host interface.","abstract":"Combretastatins interrupt blood flow of solid tumor vascular networks and lead to necrosis by blocking nutrients. However, tumors recover from tumor blood flow interruption-induced damage and develop viable rims. To investigate why cancer recurs and its prevention, we used a combretastatin derivative, Cderiv (=AC7700), and analyzed changes in tumor-host interface (T-HI) vessels, which were closest to cancer cells in the tumor margin after tumor vessel disruption, and the microenvironment surrounding them. Treatment with Cderiv (10 mg/kg) interrupted tumor blood flow in all regions of LY80 (a variant of Yoshida sarcoma) tumor, but not T-HI vessel blood flow. The same Cderiv dose given 72 h after 5 Gy irradiation stopped T-HI vessel blood flow and prevented cancer recurrence. Treatment in the reverse order, however, did not affect T-HI vessel blood flow. The greatest difference between the two treatments was the occurrence of gradual T-HI edema with the former. Severe T-HI edema compressed T-HI blood vessels, so that circulation stopped. Thus, the distance between a tumor margin and its nearest functioning host vessel became much larger, and the tumor marginal region became a microenvironment that lacked a nutritional supply. Cancer cells in tumor margins received nutrients through two circulation routes: tumor vessels and T-HI vessels. Our starvation methods, which involved treatment with Cderiv 72 h after 5 Gy irradiation, blocked both circulation routes and may have great potential as a clinical strategy to prevent cancer recurrence.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981848","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.806801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.647588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.605737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.566537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.48284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.466526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.4616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.304431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Starvation","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Combretastatin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combretastatin"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Rim (wheel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rim_(wheel)"},{"name":"Light-year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year"},{"name":"Interrupt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
