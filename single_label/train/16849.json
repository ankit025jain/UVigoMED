{"id":16849,"title":"Neutrophils at work.","abstract":"In this Review we discuss data demonstrating recently recognized aspects of neutrophil homeostasis in the steady state, granulopoiesis in 'emergency' conditions and interactions of neutrophils with the adaptive immune system. We explore in vivo observations of the recruitment of neutrophils from blood to tissues in models of blood-borne infections versus bacterial invasion through epithelial linings. We examine data on novel aspects of the activation of NADPH oxidase and the heterogeneity of phagosomes and, finally, consider the importance of two neutrophil-derived biological agents: neutrophil extracellular traps and ectosomes.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24940954","annotations":[{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Phagosome","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagosome"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.661506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","weight":0.643049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.614581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.330747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"NADPH oxidase","weight":0.216373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADPH_oxidase"},{"name":"Biological warfare","weight":0.195083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"Steady state","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state"}]}
