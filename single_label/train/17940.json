{"id":17940,"title":"[Fatigue and reduction in motor performance in sportspeople or overtraining syndrome].","abstract":"The main goal of training activities is to improve motor performance. After strenuous workouts, it is physiological to experience fatigue, which relieves within two weeks, and then induce an improvement in motor capacities. An overtraining syndrome is diagnosed when fatigue is postponed beyond two weeks, and affects mainly endurance athletes. It is a condition of chronic fatigue, underperformance and an increased vulnerability to infection leading to recurrent infections. The whole observed spectrum of symptoms is physiological, psychological, endocrinogical and immunological. All play a role in the failure to recover. Monitoring of athletes activities helps to prevent the syndrome with days with no sports. Rest, patience and empathy are the only ways of treatment options.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834618","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.530912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.319813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Overtraining","weight":0.318828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtraining"},{"name":"Endurance","weight":0.286659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance"},{"name":"Empathy","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0822264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Patience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience"}]}
