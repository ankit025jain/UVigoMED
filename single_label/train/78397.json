{"id":78397,"title":"Imaging for headache: what the otolaryngologist looks for.","abstract":"Diagnosing a rhinogenic cause of headache or facial pain outside of the classic definitions of chronic, acute, and subacute sinusitis can be challenging for the practicing otolaryngologist. Contact-point headaches have been clinically characterized as causing facial pain secondary to abutting mucosal contact from the lateral nasal wall to the septum. Imaging landmarks may help identify these potential contact points radiographically through revealing anatomic variants such as septal spurs and abnormally large lateral nasal structures. However, other potential rhinologic sources, such as barosinusitis, recurrent barotrauma, or recurrent acute sinusitis occurring between active episodes, are challenging to identify through hallmark imaging findings.
