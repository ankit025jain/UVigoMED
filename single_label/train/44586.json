{"id":44586,"title":"The prevalence of malnutrition and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in chronic pancreatitis.","abstract":"Patients with chronic pancreatitis are at risk of malnutrition and nutrient deficiency due to malabsorption, pain, and poor diet. We sought to examine fat-soluble vitamin levels and malnutrition parameters in patients with chronic pancreatitis.In a prospective controlled cohort study, 128 subjects (62 chronic pancreatitis patients and 66 age-/sex-matched controls) were recruited. Body mass index (BMI), handgrip strength (measure of functional capacity), fat stores (triceps skin fold), muscle stores (mid-arm muscle circumference), exocrine function, and serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E) were measured.Half of patients in the chronic pancreatitis group were overweight or obese, although the mean BMI was lower in patients than in controls (P = .007). Handgrip strength (P = .048), fat stores (P = .000), and muscle stores (P = .001) were lower in patients than in controls. Of the patients, 14.5% and 24.2% were deficient in vitamins A and E, respectively. Nineteen percent of patients had excess serum vitamin A levels.Despite the prevalence of overweight and obesity, patients had lower muscle stores, strength, and abnormal vitamin levels. Detailed nutrition assessment including anthropometry and vitamin status is warranted in chronic pancreatitis.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727205","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.800237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Malabsorption","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabsorption"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.763603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Exocrine gland","weight":0.403169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.240539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0693032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0524275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.0524275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Skin fold","weight":0.0524275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_fold"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"GCE Advanced Level","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
