{"id":30216,"title":"TAK1 kinase switches cell fate from apoptosis to necrosis following TNF stimulation.","abstract":"TNF activates three distinct intracellular signaling cascades leading to cell survival, caspase-8-mediated apoptosis, or receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-dependent necrosis, also called necroptosis. Depending on the cellular context, one of these pathways is activated upon TNF challenge. When caspase-8 is activated, it drives the apoptosis cascade and blocks RIPK3-dependent necrosis. Here we report the biological event switching to activate necrosis over apoptosis. TAK1 kinase is normally transiently activated upon TNF stimulation. We found that prolonged and hyperactivation of TAK1 induced phosphorylation and activation of RIPK3, leading to necrosis without caspase activation. In addition, we also demonstrated that activation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 promoted TAK1 activation, suggesting a positive feedforward loop of RIPK1, RIPK3, and TAK1. Conversely, ablation of TAK1 caused caspase-dependent apoptosis, in which Ripk3 deletion did not block cell death either in vivo or in vitro. Our results reveal that TAK1 activation drives RIPK3-dependent necrosis and inhibits apoptosis. TAK1 acts as a switch between apoptosis and necrosis.
