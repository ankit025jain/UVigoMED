{"id":61862,"title":"Serum levels of cytokines and prevalence of autoantibodies in lymphoma patients and their prognostic value.","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that cytokines and autoantibodies that have an important role in pathogenesis of lymphoma can be used as prognostic markers. In this study, we aimed to determine the prognostic significance of a large panel of serum cytokines and compare them with a control group, and also to see for any relationship with known classical prognostic factors, the frequency of autoantibody positivity and autoimmune phenomena in patients with untreated non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).For cytokine studies blood samples were obtained in the morning after fasting for at least 8-12 h. We used empty tubes for serum and EDTA-containing tubes for plasma samples. Blood samples were then transferred to laboratory in 5-10 min, plasma and sera were separated by centrifugation, and stored at -75 ?C until assayed. Then, all sera were warmed to room temperature. All the cytokine levels were studied with Panomics Company ProcartaTM Human Cytokine multiplex kits.In lymphoma patients INF-ggr; was related with thyroglobulin antibody positivity and IL-6 with direct Coombs positivity. IL-6 was the most important cytokine connected with lymphopenia and B symptoms in lymphoma patients. IL-1?, INF-?, IL-2 and IL-4 were markers associated with poor prognosis in HL. At least one autoantibody was positive in 50% of NHL and HL patients. At least one antiphospholipid antibody (APA) was positive in 26% of NHL and 38% of HL patients.TNF-? and IL-6 are poor prognostic factors that may be included in the International Prognostic Index (IPI). To understand the effects of autoantibodies in the prognosis of HL and NHL, long-term patient follow-up studies are required.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659663","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.823164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lymphocytopenia","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytopenia"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Centrifugation","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.621393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.598289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.473598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"B symptoms","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_symptoms"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.156268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Room temperature","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"House of Lords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"American Psychiatric Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
