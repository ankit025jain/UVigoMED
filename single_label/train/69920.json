{"id":69920,"title":"Detection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) using semi-quantitative [68Ga]DOTATOC PET in combination with multiphase contrast-enhanced CT.","abstract":"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) pose a diagnostic challenge with respect to the physiologic somatostatin receptor expression in the uncinate process representing a potential pitfall for receptor imaging with PET/CT.We identified 49 PNETs from a total of 316 consecutive [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT examinations for whom the detections rates of PET and multiphase contrast enhanced (CE-) CT could be retrospectively compared and 38 PNETs for which SUVmax and SUVmax target-to-liver ratios could be calculated for the tumors and the uncinate process.The detection rate of PET (83.7%) was higher than of the different CT phases (arterial: 59.2%, P=0.017; portal-venous: 38.8%, P<0.001; venous: 46.9%, P=0.001; multiphase: 71.4%, P=0.286). Compared to the other method PET revealed 28.6% additional lesions and multiphase CE-CT 16.3%. The portal-venous phase revealed only lesions that were also detected in the arterial or venous phase. The detection rate for PNETs in the uncinate process (N.=9) was 66.7% for PET versus 55.6% for multiphase CE-CT. SUVmax and SUVmax target-to-liver ratios differed significantly (P<0.001) for PNETs (mean, range: SUVmax, 14.6, 1.4-69.3; SUVmax target-to-liver ratio, 3.2, 0.69-23.1) and uncinate process (4.32, 0.8-13.5; 0.94, 0.51-1.56), however with a wide overlap.Patients with PNETs should undergo [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT with at least an arterial and venous phase CT scan. SUVmax and SUVmax target-to-liver ratios provide additional information but do no reliably separate PNETs from normal tracer uptake in the uncinate process.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265251","annotations":[{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.86265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.812614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.795517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.499681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.409076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.380205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.144383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0381353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Somatostatin receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin_receptor"},{"name":"Primitive neuroectodermal tumor","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"286","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/286"},{"name":"813","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/813"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Iron sight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_sight"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Bohr model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
