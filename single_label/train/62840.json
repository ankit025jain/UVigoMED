{"id":62840,"title":"[Effect of miR-202 on the growth of multiple myeloma cells via regulating B cell-activating factor and the underlying mechanism].","abstract":"To explore the regulating effect of miR-202 on B cell-activating factor, and check whether the regulation influences the growth of multiple myeloma cells.The potential binding sites of BAFF for miR-202 were predicted using bioinformatics software. Luciferase reporter gene analysis was used to evaluate the regulatory effect of miR-202 on BAFF. Human multiple myeloma U266 cells were transfected with has-miR-202-mimics, has-miR-202-inhibitor, siBAFF and their negative controls, respectively. After above treatments, BAFF mRNA and protein levels were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, and the proliferation and apoptosis in the multiple myeloma (MM) cells were examined by WST-1 and annexin V-FLUOS assay, respectively.The BAFF mRNA expression levels in the untransfected group, has-miR-202-3P-mimics transfected group, has-miR-202-3P-inhibitor transfected group and siBAFF transfected group were 1.040 ± 0.057, 0.573 ± 0.073, 1.205 ± 0.097 and 0.368 ± 0.052, respectively. BAFF mRNA expressions in U266 cells transfected with has-miR-202-3P-mimics and siBAFF were significantly decreased compared with that in the untransfected group (P < 0.05). The BAFF protein expression level of each group was consistent with the mRNA assay result. The absorbance value in 450 nm of the untransfected group, has-miR-202-3P-mimics transfected group, has-miR-202-3P-inhibitor transfected group and siBAFF transfected group were 1.063 ± 0.052, 0.714 ± 0.045, 0.936 ± 0.066 and 0.764 ± 0.053, respectively. In comparison with the untransfected group, the absorbance value at 450 nm of has-miR-202-3P-mimics and siBAFF transfected groups was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The cell apoptosis rates of untransfected group, has-miR-202-3P-mimics transfected group, has-miR-202-3P-inhibitor transfected group and siBAFF transfected group were 26.2%, 49.6%, 21.1% and 30.7%, respectively. Therefore, the cell apoptosis rate of has-miR-202-3P-mimics transfected group was significantly increased than that of the untransfected group (P < 0.05). p-JNK protein expression level was decreased in the has-miR-202-3P-mimics transfected cells.MiR-202 can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis in MM cells via regulating BAFF. JNK/SAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of BAFF by miR-202.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506956","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Reporter gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter_gene"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.825046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.703271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.700925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.578124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.375305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
