{"id":38992,"title":"Gastroprotective agent underuse in high-risk older daily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users over time.","abstract":"To examine whether older adults taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decreased the underuse of gastroprotective agents over time.Before-and-after study.Health, Aging and Body Composition Study.Daily users of a NSAID (prescription and over the counter (OTC)) at visits in 2002-03 (preperiod; n = 404) and 2006-07 (postperiod; n = 172). The sample had a mean ± standard deviation age of 78.2 ± 2.7 at the preperiod visit and 81.9 ± 2.7 at the postperiod visit. The majority were white and female and had 12 or more years of education.Underusers were defined as persons taking nonselective NSAIDs who were at risk of peptic ulcer disease (PUD; because of current warfarin or glucocorticoid use or history of PUD) and not using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or persons taking cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective NSAIDs and aspirin who were at risk of PUD (having at least one risk factor) and not using a PPI.Daily NSAID use decreased from 17.6% to 11.3% (P < .001), and gastroprotective agent underuse decreased from 23.5% to 15.1% (P = .008). Controlling for important covariates, having prescription insurance was somewhat protective against underuse in the preperiod (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.46-1.34; P = .37), but more so and significantly in the postperiod (AOR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.18-0.93; P = .03). Having prescription insurance was more protective in the post- than in the preperiod (less gastroprotective agent underuse; adjusted ratio of OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.22-1.29; P = .16), but this increased protection was not statistically significant.In older daily NSAID users at high risk of PUD, having prescription insurance and adequate gastroprotective use was more common in the post- than in the preperiod.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25284702","annotations":[{"name":"Warfarin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.90032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.873017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.771778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Over-the-counter drug","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.668063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.654841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.551017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.486032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.468469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.412806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.343158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.273912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"}]}
