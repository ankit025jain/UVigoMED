{"id":67727,"title":"To treat or not to treat, that is the question: the role of bone-targeted therapy in metastatic prostate cancer.","abstract":"The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 62-year-old construction site manager experienced 6 weeks of back pain that was not responsive to over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. He visited his wife's primary care physician for evaluation. He denied neurologic symptoms or worsening of pain while lying down. He smoked (30 pack-years, quit 4 years ago), and drinks 3 beers each evening and more on weekends (up to a six-pack). He has had two lower extremity fractures from falls at construction sites. At the time of the physical examination, he was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 194 pounds. He was alert, oriented, and in mild distress. He had no percussion tenderness of his spine, and a neurologic examination was negative. A digital rectal examination revealed an enlarged prostate with an area of induration of the left, normal rectal tone, and guaiac-negative stool. Laboratory studies included normal blood counts, electrolytes, and renal and liver function tests (including lactic acid dehydrogenase and total protein). The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 114 ng/mL; he had no prior PSA test. A bone scan showed diffuse bony involvement including the T7 vertebral body and left pedicle, ribs, pelvis, and calvarium. Magnetic resonance imaging of his spine confirmed bone metastases but showed no evidence of extension into the epidural space or spinal cord compromise. A prostate biopsy revealed Gleason 4+4 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Androgen deprivation therapy with leuprolide acetate was initiated, and the addition of a bone-targeted agent was considered.
