{"id":16646,"title":"An unusual presentation of listeriosis: anemia and cutaneous manifestations.","abstract":"Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogen causing food-borne disease. It usually affects the young as well as immunocompromised individuals and is associated with high mortality rates. Cutaneous manifestations have rarely been described. We describe an interesting case of a traveller from the tropics presenting with cutaneous listeriosis and anemia.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968680","annotations":[{"name":"Listeria monocytogenes","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Listeriosis","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeriosis"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.821006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.586975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.362412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"}]}
