{"id":9497,"title":"Gammadelta (??) T lymphocytes do not impact the development of early atherosclerosis.","abstract":"Gammadelta (??) T cells are a subset of pro-inflammatory innate-like T lymphocytes that serve as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. ?? T cells are highly enriched in cholesterol compared to ?? T cells. In this study, we aimed to identify the role of ?? T cells in atherosclerosis, a cholesterol and inflammation-driven disease.We found that the percentages of ?? T cells are increased in ApoE(-/-) mice fed a Western diet. We generated TCR?(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice and fed them either rodent chow or a Western diet for ten weeks for the assessment of atherosclerosis.The atherosclerotic lesion size in diet-fed TCR?(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice was similar to that of diet-fed ApoE(-/-) mice. There were no differences in cytokine production or numbers of ?? T cells in aorta of TCR?(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice. Plasma lipoprotein profiles were unchanged by the absence of ?? T cells.Our data suggest that ?? T cells do not contribute to early atherosclerotic plaque development.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704628","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.826984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.779448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Atheroma","weight":0.761326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheroma"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.753434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.7471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.734911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.660562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.586317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.156525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Western pattern diet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_pattern_diet"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
