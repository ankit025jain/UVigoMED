{"id":36767,"title":"Aplasia cutis congenita: approach to evaluation and management.","abstract":"Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) refers to any condition in which there is absence of skin at birth. This can be isolated ACC occurring on the scalp, with or without underlying ectopic neural tissue, or ACC can be associated with other conditions such as Adams-Oliver syndrome or epidermolysis bullosa. We discuss the different types of ACC and associated anomalies along with an approach to diagnosis and management.
