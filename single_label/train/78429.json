{"id":78429,"title":"[The treatment and clinical therapeutic effect analysis in 59 cases of advanced supraglottic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma].","abstract":"To compare the therapeutic effect of postoperative radiotherapy with surgery alone in advanced supraglottic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).According to the treatment methods, 59 patients with advanced supraglottic LSCC were divided into surgery plus radiotherapy group (S+R group) (33 cases) and surgical group (S group) (26 cases). In S+R group, total laryngectomy was performed on 27 patients and partial laryngectomy on 6 patients, 27 of whom underwent lateral neck dissections; while in S group, total laryngectomy was performed on 23 patients and partial laryngectomy on 3 patients, 24 of whom underwent lateral neck dissections.The 3-year overall survival rate of S+R and S group were 62.6% and 62.6% respectively, and the 5-year overall survival rate of S+R and S group were 43.8% and 40.5% respectively. But there was no statistically significant difference of survival rate between two groups by Log-rank test (P > 0.05). In S+R group, recurrence happened in 5 cases and the recurrent rate was 15.1%; in S group, recurrence happened in 10 patients and the recurrent rate was 38.5%, statistically significant difference was found between the two recurrent rates (P < 0.05).Surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy could not improve the 3-year-or 5-year overall survival rate, but could significantly reduced tumor recurrence rate.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669687","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.713328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.532683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.518911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
