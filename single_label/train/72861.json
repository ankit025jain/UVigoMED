{"id":72861,"title":"Mammaglobin A: review and clinical utility.","abstract":"Mammaglobin A is a protein that belongs to the secretoglobin superfamily. It has highly specific expression in cells from most breast cancers and may be used to detect circulating or disseminated tumor cells. In addition, mammaglobin A is currently under inves tigation as a potential therapeutic target for immune therapies that target breast cancer. The present review will highlight our current understanding of mammaglobin A at the genetic and protein level and its potential clinical applications. Characteristics of breast cancer and methods used to isolate and detect circulating tumor cells will also be presented.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24938021","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"}]}
