{"id":56424,"title":"Roles of three common VEGF polymorphisms in the risk of age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"Associations between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms (rs833061, rs1413711, and rs3025039) and risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have been extensively studied, but the currently available results are contentious rather than conclusive. Therefore, we performed the present meta-analysis to further assess the associations. Literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted until April 2013. The strength of the associations between VEGF polymorphisms and AMD risk was estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Both models of fixed effects and random effects were performed to summarize the pooled ORs. All data were analyzed by Stata software 12.0. The meta-analysis results based on nine case-control studies with 2427 cases and 2037 controls showed that rs833061 had protective effects on AMD risk (TT vs. CT+CC: OR=0.58, 95% CI=0.41-0.81), whereas rs1413711 (TT vs. CT+CC: OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.10-1.93) and rs3025039 (TT vs. CC: OR=1.87, 95% CI=1.15-3.02; TT vs. CT+CC: OR=2.09, 95% CI=1.30-3.37) represented as risk factors for AMD. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity suggested significantly reduced risk in Caucasians (TT vs. CT+CC: OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.36-0.99; T vs. C: OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.78-1.00) and Asians (TT+CT vs. CC: OR=0.57, 95% CI=0.34-0.96; TT vs. CT+CC: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.33-0.90) for rs833061, yet elevated risk in Caucasians (TT vs. CT+CC: OR=2.05, 95% CI=1.24-3.38) for rs1413711 and in Asians (TT vs. CC: OR=2.06, 95% CI=1.24-3.43; TT vs. CC: OR=2.34, 95% CI=1.42-3.89) for rs3025039. In stratified analysis by type of AMD, rs833061 was observed to decrease wet AMD risk, while rs1413711 and rs3025039 were found to increase the risk of wet AMD. Based on the currently available data, this meta-analysis suggests that the VEGF polymorphisms may be associated with risk of AMD, particularly wet AMD.
