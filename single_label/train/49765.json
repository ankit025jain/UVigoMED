{"id":49765,"title":"Schmidt's syndrome presenting as a generalised anxiety disorder: a case report.","abstract":"Schmidt's syndrome or autoimmune polyglandurar syndrome type 2 represents an uncommon endocrine disorder composed by Addison's disease with autoimmune thyroid disease and/or type 1 diabetes mellitus. The syndrome usually affects women in the fourth decade of their lives. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious complications. We present the case of a 64-year-old woman with generalised anxiety, facing socio-economic problems. Her symptoms attributed to stress led to a late diagnosis. Physicians involved have to be aware about endocrine disorders of which first manifestations may have atypical components mimicking mental health problems.
