{"id":87023,"title":"[Intrafollicular infection of mammals and human oocytes by the herpes simplex virus].","abstract":"The goal of this work was to study the capacity of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) of infecting ovary with disease in case of the intravaginal experimental animals. The results of the study demonstrated that the ascending HSV infection in mice lead to modification of all the cells of the ovary, including follicular cells synthesizing estrogen and progesterone. The two hormones influence the development of the disease. Estrogens provide the protective effects against the virus. Progesterone does not modify the body sensitivity to HSV, but reduces the effectiveness of the antiviral immunity, resulting in increased mortality of animals. We demonstrated that infection of oocytes in ovarian follicles of female mice during infection with HSV modified the process in vitro and for the first time demonstrated the detection of viral antigens in mature oocytes in patient with infertility. During the intracytoplasmic sperm injection into the infected oocytes (ICSI), the failure of fertilization was observed. These results are of interest, because there is no available literature on whether HSV infection of oocytes can have a direct negative impact on the process of fertilization in humans.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065146","annotations":[{"name":"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection"},{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.841674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.744401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.487163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.481203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.443227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.42139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.415605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.405764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.253525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.246925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Follicular cell","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_cell"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
