{"id":61256,"title":"[Treatment of cancer chemotherapy-associated anemia in Japan - conditions and issues].","abstract":"Cancer chemotherapy-induced anemia(CIA)is observed in approximately 70%of patients treated with cytotoxic chemo- therapy. The hemoglobin concentration in the peripheral blood is C10 g/dL in 40% of these patients, and C8 g/dL in 23% of these patients. Red blood cell transfusion is performed in 16% of these patients. Since erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA)are not approved in Japan, blood transfusion is the only choice of treatment for CIA. In Northwestern countries, ESA have been utilized for the treatment of CIA for >20 years. Recently, however, the use of ESA has become regulated towing to concerns about the potential life-shortening effects, although ESA are still the treatment of choice for CIA. In this paper, the characteristics of CIA in Japan and the underlying issues have been discussed.
