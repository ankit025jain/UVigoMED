{"id":82194,"title":"Licochalcone A as a potent antitumor agent suppresses growth of human oral cancer SCC-25 cells in vitro via caspase-3 dependent pathways.","abstract":"The majority of anticancer drugs are of natural origin. However, it is unknown whether licochalcone A is cytotoxic towards oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. The goal of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of licochalcone A on the human OSCC SCC-25 cells and to identify the underlying molecular mechanism. Exposure of SCC-25 cells to licochalcone A dose- and time-dependently decreased cell viability by arresting cell cycle at the S and G2/M phase as well as inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, the proapoptotic activity of licochalcone A was revealed by DNA fragmentation. Concomitantly, we observed activation of the effector caspases-3, induced by activation of the initiator caspases -8 and -9, which subsequent trigger both death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in licochalcone A-mediated SCC-25 cell apoptosis. Besides, treatment with 50 ?g/mL of licochalcone A for 36 h led to the cleavage of PARP, an indicator of apoptosis induction. Therefore licochalcone A may be a good candidate for development as a possible chemopreventive agent against OSCC.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691971","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"M phase","weight":0.766946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_phase"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.728732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.602309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.596785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.589692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.451825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.437795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.424989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.396729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.360065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Restriction digest","weight":0.0542089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_digest"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"G2 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G2_phase"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
