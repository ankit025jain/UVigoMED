{"id":22478,"title":"[Healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic resistance: a global challenge for the 21st century].","abstract":"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. They represent one of the biggest Public Health problems today as they prolong hospital stay, reduce quality of life and increase mortality. The frequency and severity of HAIs have increased due to increased severity of patients being admitted to hospitals, increased use of vascular catheterization and progressive spread of antibioticresistant strains. In Italy, there are wide regional variations in antibiotic consumption and in the incidence of infections by multiresistant germs. This suggests the need to not only limit consumption of antibiotics but also to improve their appropriate use. Unfortunately, not all HAIs are preventable: it is therefore advisable to selectively monitor those that are attributable to problems in the quality of care. Prevention of HAIs is obviously aimed at protecting the health of patients; however, occupational exposure of healthcare workers (HCW) has also been receiving increased attention. This has resulted in the dissemination of guidelines and operating instructions aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to biological agents, through the implementation of general and specific infection control measures. The authors also highlight that litigation related to HAIs is a trend that should be kept in mind by every HCW, especially in light of the fact that the frequency of malpractice liability claims is increasing.
