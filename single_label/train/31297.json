{"id":31297,"title":"New approach to the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction.","abstract":"Much progress has been made in the last decade in the understanding the neural substrates of drug addiction, transmitters involved, epigenetic background and their relation to learning and memory but much remains to be elucidated and strong effort is necessary to integrate the rich information at the molecular, cellular systems, and behavioral levels to further clarify the mechanisms and therapy of this complex disease. The aim of this review is to collect and interpret the latest opinions in the development, the underlying mechanisms and therapy of addiction as a disease of central nervous system. The neurocircuitry, the transmitters and the epigenetics of addiction are discussed.
