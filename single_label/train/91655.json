{"id":91655,"title":"Lower genitourinary trauma in modern warfare: the experience from civil violence in Iraq.","abstract":"Reports on genitourinary (GU) trauma during the Iraqi conflict have been limited to battlefield injuries. We sought to characterise the incidence, mechanism of injury, wounding pattern, and management of lower GU injuries sustained in civil violence during the Iraqi war.A total of 2800 casualties with penetrating trauma to the abdomen and pelvis were treated at the Yarmouk Hospital, Baghdad from January 2004 to June 2008. Of the casualties 504 (18%) had GU trauma including 217 (43%) with one or more injuries to the lower GU organs.Among the 217 patients there were 262 lower GU injuries involving the bladder in 128 (48.8%) patients, bulbo-prostatic urethra in 21 (8%), penis in 24 (9.2%), and scrotum in 89 (34%). Injuries to the anterior urethra and genitals were inflicted by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in 53-67% of cases and by individual firearms in 33-47%, while injuries to the posterior urethra and bladder were inflicted by IEDs in 17-22% of cases and by firearms in 78-83%. All penile wounds were repaired save 3 (12.5%) patients who underwent total penectomy. Of 63 injured testicles 54 (86%) could be salvaged and 9 (14%) required unilateral orchiectomy. The leading cause of death was an associated injury to major blood vessels in 26 (84%) of 31 patients who died.Injuries to the anterior urethra and genitals were commonly caused by IEDs, while injuries to the posterior urethra and bladder were usually caused by individual firearms. Testis injury was almost always salvageable. Associated trauma to major blood vessels was the leading cause of death in these casualties.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485550","annotations":[{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Scrotum","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.822236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.677464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Inguinal orchiectomy","weight":0.677318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_orchiectomy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.621298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Iraq","weight":0.621261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Penectomy","weight":0.553049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penectomy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Baghdad","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.262636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Iraq War","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.156906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.132571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Penetrating trauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrating_trauma"},{"name":"War","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Firearm","weight":0.0245813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Civil war","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war"},{"name":"Siege","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Improvised explosive device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
