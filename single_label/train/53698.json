{"id":53698,"title":"Quantitative and qualitative bone assessment of the posterior mandible in patients with diabetes mellitus: a cone beam computed tomography study.","abstract":"Evaluation of mandibular bone features is very important for the diagnosis, treatment planning and management of dental procedures such as osseointegrated implants.To evaluate the bone quantity and quality of the posterior region of the mandible using the CBCT technique for implant planning in patients with diabetes mellitus.Twenty-three patients with diabetes mellitus and 27 control subjects participated in the study. Mandibular bone measurements were performed on the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. One previously calibrated oral radiologist with CBCT experience measured the distance from mandibular canal to alveolar ridge and the distance from bucal to lingual cortical wall. Also, it was assessed the bone quality of each region of interest, by measuring the bone mineral density. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee.The study revealed the presence of significant correlations between bone quality and values ofglycosylated hemoglobin and a significant association between patient gender and bone type. There is a significant inverse correlation between the values of cortical and trabecular bone density in the posterior region of the mandible and HbA1c.In conclusion the use of CBCT in preoperative bone measurements will help provide valuable information about the quantity and quality of bone before the placement of dental implants.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502082","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.729478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.713482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.683537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.584962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Osseointegration","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration"},{"name":"Mandibular canal","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_canal"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.40456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.333384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.323418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.299158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.261232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.251367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dental alveolus","weight":0.177193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_alveolus"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.160801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Calibration","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibration"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Spiral computed tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
