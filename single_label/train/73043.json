{"id":73043,"title":"Predictions for the future of kallikrein-related peptidases in molecular diagnostics.","abstract":"Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) form a cancer-related ensemble of serine proteases. This multigene family hosts the most widely used cancer biomarker that is PSA-KLK3, with millions of tests performed annually worldwide. The present report provides an overview of the biomarker potential of the extended KLK family (KLK1-KLK15) in various disease settings and envisages approaches that could lead to additional KLK-driven applications in future molecular diagnostics. Particular focus is given on the inclusion of KLKs into multifaceted cancer biomarker panels that provide enhanced diagnostic, prognostic and/or predictive accuracy in several human malignancies. Such panels have been described so far for prostate, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers. The role of KLKs as biomarkers in non-malignant disease settings, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, is also commented upon. Predictions are given on the challenges and future directions regarding clinically oriented KLK research.
