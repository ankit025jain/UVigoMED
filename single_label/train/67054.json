{"id":67054,"title":"Innovative strategy with potential to increase hemodialysis efficiency and safety.","abstract":"Uremic toxins are mainly represented by blood urine nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Crea) whose removal is critically important in hemodialysis (HD) for kidney disease. Patients undergoing HD have a complex illness, resulting from: inadequate removal of organic waste, dialysis-induced oxidative stress and membrane-induced inflammation. Here we report innovative breakthroughs for efficient and safe HD by using a plasmon-induced dialysate comprising Au nanoparticles (NPs)-treated (AuNT) water that is distinguishable from conventional deionized (DI) water. The diffusion coefficient of K3Fe(CN)6 in saline solution can be significantly increased from 2.76, to 4.62 Ã— 10(-6) cm s(-1), by using AuNT water prepared under illumination by green light-emitting diodes (LED). In vitro HD experiments suggest that the treatment times for the removals of 70% BUN and Crea are reduced by 47 and 59%, respectively, using AuNT water instead of DI water in dialysate, while additionally suppressing NO release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cells.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651843","annotations":[{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.783621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.68333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.657154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.537941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.519817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.444256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.403423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.299636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Blood urea nitrogen","weight":0.274118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_urea_nitrogen"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.141683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lighting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting"},{"name":"Brownian motion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion"},{"name":"Organic matter","weight":0.0248507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_matter"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Purified water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
