{"id":30193,"title":"Semantic processing to identify adverse drug event information from black box warnings.","abstract":"We utilized a semantic natural language processing approach to extract adverse drug event information from FDA black box warnings. Overall performance was 90% precision, 51% recall, and 0.65 F-Score. Information extracted can be stored in a structured format and may be useful to support clinical decision support systems.
