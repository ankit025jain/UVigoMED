{"id":90915,"title":"Treatment of massive rotator-cuff tears with a polyester ligament (LARS) patch.","abstract":"We describe and analyse the results of our technique for repairing chronic massive tears (Goutallier grade 3 or 4) of the rotator cuff using a ligament augmentation and reconstruction system. This prospective, single surgeon series included 29 symptomatic patients (21 male, 8 female) with a mean age of 67.1 years who underwent 31 ligament augmentation and reconstruction system procedures (two bilateral procedures) with a mean follow-up period of 3 years. All patients had clinical, radiographic, magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopic evidence of a chronic massive rotator cuff tear. The primary outcome measure was assessed using the Oxford Shoulder Score and visual analogue score pre-operatively and at follow-up. Postoperative overall Oxford shoulder score and visual analogue score results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement at follow-up, compared with pre-operative values (p < 0.0001). Post-operative acromio-humeral interval showed a statistically significant increase when compared to pre-operative radiographs (p = 0.0004). Two patients required revision with good postoperative results. We believe that, in the appropriate age group, the ligament augmentation and reconstruction system repair offers a good option for chronic, primary, non-closable rotator cuff defects in terms of pain relief and function.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563965","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance
