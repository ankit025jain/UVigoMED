{"id":44835,"title":"High expression of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is associated with favorable prognosis after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"The expression of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) is frequently downregulated in numerous cancers. 5-hmC and IDH2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has yet to be determined.The immunohistochemical expression of 5-hmC and IDH2 were analyzed in tissue microarrays containing samples from 646 patients who had undergone hepatectomy for histologically proven HCC. The prognostic value of 5-hmC and IDH2 were evaluated by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses.We discovered that low 5-hmC and IDH2 expression was associated with malignant behaviors. Low 5-hmC or IDH2 expression alone and combined 5-hmC and IDH2 expression were associated with lower overall survival (OS) rates and higher cumulative recurrence rates. Multivariate analysis indicated that 5-hmC or IDH2 and 5-hmC/IDH2 were independent prognostic indicators for OS and time to recurrence (TTR), which was confirmed in an independent validation cohort.5-hmC and IDH2 correlate with less aggressive tumor behavior in HCC. When 5-hmC and IDH2 are considered together, they serve as a prognostic marker in patients with surgically resected HCCs.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716838","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.626425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.601946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.494631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.330127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.302517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Isocitrate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isocitrate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Isocitric acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isocitric_acid"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"646","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/646"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Transthyretin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
