{"id":91007,"title":"Complex care: Ventilation management when brain injury and acute lung injury coexist.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to explore the management of coexisting brain insult and acute lung injury to help guide clinicians in balancing what may appear to be competing goals. First, contemporary management of mechanically ventilated patients with either brain or lung injury diagnoses is reviewed, followed by a review of intracranial pressure and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The article ends with a discussion of a literature review regarding possible treatment balance when the two conditions coexist.
