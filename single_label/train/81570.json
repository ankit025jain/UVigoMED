{"id":81570,"title":"Permanent mandibular canine(s) impaction: expansion of our understanding.","abstract":"Eruption disturbances, tooth size and specific malocclusions are known to be genetically influenced. The clinical association between these traits may indicate common genetic controls.A cross-sectional clinical study was designed to test the null hypothesis that the maximum mesiodistal crown diameter (MMD) of maxillary and mandibular central and lateral incisors and the prevalence of various classes of incisor relationships (Class I, II/1, II/2 and III) do not differ between the subjects with and without permanent mandibular canine(s) impaction.Dental models of 43 subjects diagnosed with mandibular canine(s) impaction (Impaction Group - IG) were compared with those of 86 subjects of a control reference sample (Control Group - CG). Independent t-test and chi-square tests were used to determine the association between mandibular canine(s) impaction and the MMD of the incisors and the incisor relationship, respectively. The likelihood of various incisor relationships between the IG and CG were evaluated according to odds ratios.A fourfold increase (p < 0.0001) in the overall frequency of Class II/2 incisor relationship was observed in the IG when compared to controls.The null hypothesis was rejected. Subjects with mandibular canine(s) impaction appeared to be characterised with wider incisors and a remarkably high rate of Class II/2 malocclusion. This information assists the understanding of genetically controlled dental anomalies, which are likely to coexist with mandibular canine(s) impaction.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968644","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.708469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.653839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.548175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.329115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.314591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.262912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.205791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.136567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Null hypothesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis"},{"name":"Maxillary lateral incisor","weight":0.0224886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_lateral_incisor"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Movement for Multi-Party Democracy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Multi-Party_Democracy"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Computer-generated imagery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery"},{"name":"Impaction","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaction"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Crown (tooth)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(tooth)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
