{"id":72743,"title":"[Clinical observation on two-way quintuple puncture in the treatment of ganglion].","abstract":"To explore the better therapy in the treatment of ganglion.Ninety cases of ganglion were randomized into a two-way quintuple puncture group, a common quintuple puncture group and a fire needling group, 30 cases in each one. In the two-way quintuple puncture group, the \"9-in-1\" multiple penetrating needling technique was used. In the common quintuple puncture group, the traditional \"5-in-1\" multiple penetrating needling technique was applied. In the fire needling group, the traditional multiple fire needling technique was adopted. The treatment was given once a day, 3 treatments made one session and the efficacy was analyzed statistically after 1 session treatment in the three groups.All of the three therapeutic methods achieved the efficacy on ganglion. The curative rate was 96. 7% (29/30) in the two-way quintuple puncture group, which was better obviously than 66.7% (20/30) in the common quintuple puncture group and 60. 0% (18/30) in the fire needling group (both P<0. 01).The two-way quintuple puncture technique achieves the remarkably superior efficacy on ganglion as compared with the common quintuple puncture technique and fire needling technique.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946633","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.736147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.34266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Fire","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.0290314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"1830","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1830"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"5\"/38 caliber gun","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5\"/38_caliber_gun"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Tuple","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
