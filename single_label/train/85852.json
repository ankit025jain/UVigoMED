{"id":85852,"title":"Are stroke cases affected by sleep disordered breathings all the same?","abstract":"Sleep disordered breathings (SDB) worsens the clinical prognosis of stroke patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a promising effective treatment. Unfortunately, not all patients are compliant with CPAP, suggesting that it is not appropriate for all patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) after stroke. People with the highest likelihood of benefiting have to be identified. We present a classification of cases with stroke and SDB to be adopted in order to identify the best responders to CPAP treatment. We propose to classify patients in four subgroups: (1) patients who terminate the apnoea by arousing from sleep; these cases are those affected either by an anatomical or a functional obstruction of upper airways that may precede or are the consequence of stroke; (2) cases that alternate OSA to central sleep apnoea (CSA) cause of an altered loop gain; (3) cases in whom ischemic damages have altered the sleep microstructure (CAP); (4) cases that manifest a CSA as the direct consequence of stroke on the central neuronal drive to breath. So far, no study has investigated the consequences of stroke on sleep microstructure. In order to better elucidate these relationships, when reviewing the PSG tracings of stroke patients, the microstructure of sleep should be systematically analysed.
