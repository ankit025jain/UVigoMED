{"id":86689,"title":"[Pulmonary resection using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery--20 years experience].","abstract":"Major lung resection using minimally invasive techniques - video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) - was first described 20 years ago. However, its development has been slow in many countries because the value of this approach has been questioned. Different techniques and definitions of VATS are used and this can be confusing for physicians and surgeons. The benefit of minimally invasive thoracic surgery was not always apparent, while many surgeons pointed to suboptimal operative outcomes. Recently, technological advances (radiology, full HD monitor and new stapler devices) have improved VATS outcomes. The objectives of this review are to emphasize the accepted definition of VATS resection, outline the different techniques developed and their results including morbidity and mortality compared to conventional approaches. Minimally invasive thoracic surgery has not been proven to give superior survival (level one evidence) compared to thoracotomy. A slight advantage has been demonstrated for short-term outcomes. VATS is not a surgical revolution but rather an evolution of surgery. It should be considered together with the new medical environment including stereotactic radiotherapy and radiofrequency. VATS seems to be more accurate in the treatment of small lung lesions diagnosed with screening CT scan. In the academic field, VATS allows easier teaching and diffusion of techniques.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750952","annotations":[{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.758691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.757355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Thoracic surgery","weight":0.72518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.592691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.304947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.278344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Video monitor","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_monitor"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Revolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"}]}
