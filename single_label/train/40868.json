{"id":40868,"title":"Use of sirolimus in the treatment of refractory autoimmune hepatitis.","abstract":"Corticosteroids and azathioprine are widely accepted as the initial therapy for autoimmune hepatitis. However, the disease is refractory to steroids in about 10%-20% of patients, for whom currently there is no standardized treatment. Here we describe our experience with sirolimus in treatment of steroid refractory autoimmune hepatitis.This is a longitudinal follow-up study. Between November 2007 and January 2014, 5 subjects with steroid refractory autoimmune hepatitis were treated with sirolimus at our institution.A response, defined as a sustained >50% fall in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, was achieved in 4/5 patients. A complete response, sustained normalization of ALT levels, was achieved in 2/5 patients. The need for steroids was significantly reduced in all patients (P < .05).In this small series, sirolimus appears to be useful in the treatment of patients with steroid refractory autoimmune hepatitis.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979741","annotations":[{"name":"Azathioprine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine"},{"name":"Autoimmune hepatitis","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.846737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.628222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.542605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.280041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.111569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1020"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
