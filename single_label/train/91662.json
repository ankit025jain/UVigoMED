{"id":91662,"title":"Role of oral fluids in DNA investigations.","abstract":"The assay of oral fluid (OF), a biofluid historically well-studied biochemically and physiologically, is a growing area of research with implications for basic and clinical purposes. In the last decade, it has gained considerable attention and lately, the use of OF has provided a substantial addition as an investigative tool in forensic and/or legal procedures. This article is an appraisal of various applications of OF sourced DNA in the field of forensic analysis. We have discussed the significance of different collection methods and their variations along with the application of specific analytical methods based on the condition of the sample. It is likely that the germaneness of OF assays will continue to expand thus providing a new instrument for investigation in criminal/legal proceedings.
