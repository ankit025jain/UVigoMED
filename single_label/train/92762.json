{"id":92762,"title":"An investigator-initiated, double-blind, vehicle-controlled pilot study: assessment for tachyphylaxis to topically occluded halobetasol 0.05% ointment in the treatment of psoriasis.","abstract":"Topical corticosteroids are the most common first-line treatment for psoriasis. Tachyphylaxis, a decreased response to treatment with repetitive application of the drug, is a controversial phenomenon associated with topical corticosteroid treatment.We sought to prove or disprove tachyphylaxis to occluded halobetasol 0.05% versus vehicle.Patients with plaque psoriasis were recruited to this study. The study involved 3 phases (1, 2A, and 2B) with each phase being separated by a treatment vacation period. In phases 1 and 2A, 2 plaques were randomized to either halobetasol 0.05% or vehicle ointment application. In phase 2B, halobetasol 0.05% was applied to both. Target Lesion Severity Scale was used for clinical assessment.Twenty patients were enrolled. No difference in time to clearance (P=.88) or time to recurrence (P=.92) of the treated plaques was found between phases 1 and 2A. Percentage of improvement was higher in phase 2A compared with phase 1 (89.4%, P<.05 vs 71%, P<.05), as a result of reduction of vehicle effect. In phase 2B, a greater improvement was found for previously corticosteroid-treated plaques.Limitations are small sample size and 1 corticosteroid tested.No evidence of tachyphylaxis to the topical corticosteroid halobetasol 0.05% ointment treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis was found.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929883","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.908125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.813961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.248859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tachyphylaxis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyphylaxis"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0733665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0541379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ulobetasol","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulobetasol"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.020818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Second baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"In phase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_phase"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Target Corporation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Engineering tolerance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"}]}
