{"id":61431,"title":"Autologous stem cell transplantation in elderly patients with multiple myeloma: past, present, and future.","abstract":"High-dose melphalan (200 mg/m(2)) as conditioning regimen followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) rescue has been established as a standard treatment for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) younger than 65 years of age. However, the role of ASCT in elderly patients older than 65 years remains controversial in the era of novel agents such as thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide. The efficacy and feasibility of ASCT have been shown in elderly patients by reducing the dose of melphalan to 100-140 mg/m(2). Although the clinical benefit of reduced-intensity ASCT in elderly patients has not been clearly established in comparison with that of novel agent-based induction therapy, recent studies have demonstrated that sequential strategies of novel agent-based induction therapy and reduced-intensity ASCT followed by consolidation/maintenance with novel agents translate into better outcome in the management of elderly patients. Thus, ASCT could also be a mainstay in the initial treatment of elderly MM patients, and its indication should be evaluated based on performance status and the presence of complications and/or comorbidities of each elderly patient with MM.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719860","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Melphalan","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melphalan"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Autologous stem cell transplantation","weight":0.798715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.713197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.70335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.521643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.479809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.359427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.332137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.268384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"}]}
