{"id":81499,"title":"Malocclusion and socioeconomic indicators in primary dentition.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of malocclusion and associations with socioeconomic indicators among preschoolers. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 732 children 3 to 5 years of age in the city of Campina Grande, Brazil. Three dentists underwent a calibration exercise (K = 0.85–0.90) and diagnosed malocclusion based on the criteria proposed by Foster & Hamilton and Grabowski et al. Parents/guardians answered a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic aspects. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and bivariate Poisson regression (PR; ? = 5%). The prevalence of malocclusion was 62.4%. The most frequent types were increased overjet (42.6%), anterior open bite (21%) and deep overbite (19.3%). An association was found between malocclusion and age: the prevalence of malocclusion was greater among younger children, with the highest prevalence among 3-year-olds (PR = 1.116; 95%CI = 1.049–1.187). The prevalence of malocclusion was high. Mother's schooling and household income were not associated with malocclusion. Socioeconomic factors were also not associated with the occurrence of malocclusion.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000602","annotations":[{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.24812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.218346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.167041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Calibration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibration"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Campina Grande","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campina_Grande"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Open bite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_bite"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"732","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/732"},{"name":"850","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/850"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Household income in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Campina (company)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campina_(company)"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"}]}
