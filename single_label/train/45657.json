{"id":45657,"title":"The expression of programmed death-1 in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during hepatitis B virus infection progression and its correlation with clinical baseline characteristics.","abstract":"Programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression was investigated in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients at the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection, liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stages.PD-1 expression in circulating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was detected by flow cytometry. The correlations between PD-1 expression and HBV viral load, alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) levels and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0.PD-1 expression in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was significantly increased in both the CHB group and advanced-stage group (LC plus HCC). In the CHB group, PD-1 expression in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was positively correlated with the HBV viral load, ALT, and AST levels. However, in the LC plus HCC group, significant correlations between PD-1 expression and the clinical parameters were nearly absent.PD-1 expression in peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells is dynamic, changes with HBV infection progression, and is related to HBV viral load and liver function, especially in CHB. PD-1 expression could be utilized as a potential clinical indicator to determine the extent of virus replication and liver injury.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672661","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.791478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.743199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.713313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.554331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.533837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.458945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.430815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.273267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.252246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"}]}
