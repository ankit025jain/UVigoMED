{"id":2155,"title":"Comparative study of the QUEST questionnaire and GerdQ questionnaire for Japanese students.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to comparatively examine the convenience of use of the QUEST and GerdQ questionnaires as self-administered diagnostic instruments.This was a two-way crossover study conducted from December 2011 to April 2012. The subjects were 70 third-year nursing students of Yokohama Soei University in Yokohama, Japan. They were randomly assigned to fill in either of the study questionnaires first, and then the other on a later.A significant difference was observed in the questionnaire completion time between the QUEST and GerdQ questionnaires (125.5 vs. 44 seconds, P < 0.0001) and also in the number of subjects asking questions while completing the questionnaires (26 vs. 1 subject, respectively: P < 0.0001). To detect GERD based on a QUEST score of ?4, ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve for the GerdQ score of 0.616. The optimal cutoff value of the GerdQ score was 6, and the sensitivity and specificity calculated using this cutoff value were 0.842 and 0.312, respectively.This study revealed that Japanese subjects may find it easier to complete the GerdQ than the QUEST questionnaire.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436350","annotations":[{"name":"Japan","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.200698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Yokohama","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"842","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/842"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Crossover (music)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(music)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Metalworking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Quest (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(TV_channel)"}]}
