{"id":92493,"title":"Preclinical evaluation of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel for treatment of pediatric bone sarcoma.","abstract":"The combination of docetaxel and gemcitabine is frequently used to treat recurrent bone sarcoma. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is less toxic and more active than docetaxel or paclitaxel for breast cancer patients. The combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine has preclinical synergy and is approved to treat pancreatic cancer. We observed growth inhibition and improved survival with nab-paclitaxel in a Ewing sarcoma xenograft, and activity was additive with gemcitabine in an osteosarcoma model. Primary Ewing sarcoma tumors expressed the transport protein SPARC, previously associated with nab-paclitaxel activity. These findings provide rationale for further evaluation of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine for bone sarcoma.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24753077","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.821372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.798171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.682151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.424789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.21971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Ewing's sarcoma","weight":0.200136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewing's_sarcoma"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"SPARC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
