{"id":76793,"title":"Impact of obesity and physical activity on functional outcomes in the elderly: data from NHANES 2005-2010.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to (a) to examine whether the association between obesity and physical functioning among older adults is moderated by physical activity (PA) and (b) to test whether this moderating effect varies by gender.Data from adults (aged >60 years) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2005-2010) were analyzed. Using multivariate logistic regression, we estimated the prevalence ratio (PR) of functional limitations and impairment in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, by body mass index and PA, while adjusting for age, educational level, and a comorbidity index.The sample included 5,304 subjects (mean age = 70.4 years), and 50.5% were female. Overweight and obesity were associated with higher levels of functional limitations when compared with normal weight individuals regardless of the PA status (PR = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.17, 1.85], and PR = 2.71, 95% CI [2.00, 3.67], respectively) even after adjustment for confounders.Overweight and obesity are associated with impairment in functional outcomes irrespective of PA.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24913317","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic
