{"id":74763,"title":"Factors associated with tender point count in Puerto Ricans with fibromyalgia syndrome.","abstract":"To examine the factors associated with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) tender point count (TPC) in a group of Hispanic patients from Puerto Rico.A cross-sectional study was performed in 144 FMS patients as determined using American College of Rheumatology [ACR] classification). Sociodemographic features, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, and pharmacologic agents were determined during the study visit. Tender points were assessed as described in the ACR classification for FMS. A t-test and one-way ANOVA test were used to examine the relationships between continuous, dichotomous, and nominal variables.The mean (standard deviation, [SD]) age of the FMS patients in this study was 50.2 (9.9) years; 95.1% were females. The mean (SD) TPC was 15.0 (4.7). Dysmenorrhea, the sicca syndrome, subjective swelling, increased urinary frequency, shortness of breath, headache, constipation, paresthesia, cognitive dysfunction, arthralgia, tiredness, morning stiffness, depression, and anxiety were associated with higher TPC. No associations were seen between socio-demographic features and FMS pharmacologic therapies.In this group of Puerto Ricans with FMS, TPC was associated with several FMS symptoms and comorbidities. This study suggests that TPC may be a simple and effective tool for assessing disease severity in FMS patients.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244879","annotations":[{"name":"Fibromyalgia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia"},{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"American College of Rheumatology","weight":0.776192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Rheumatology"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Dysmenorrhea","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmenorrhea"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Joint stiffness","weight":0.480724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_stiffness"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Frequent urination","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent_urination"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0623561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Dichotomy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy"}]}
