{"id":56826,"title":"Long non-coding RNAs: new players in ocular neovascularization.","abstract":"Pathological neovascularization are the most prevalent causes of moderate or severe vision loss. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a novel class of regulatory molecules involved in numerous biological processes and complicated diseases. However, the role of lncRNAs in ocular neovascularization is still unclear. Here, we constructed a murine model of ocular neovascularization, and determined lncRNA expression profiles using microarray analysis. We identified 326 or 51 lncRNAs that were significantly either up-regulated or down-regulated in the vaso-obliteration or neovascularization phase, respectively. Based on Pearson correlation analysis, lncRNAs/mRNAs co-expression networks were constructed. GO enrichment analysis of lncRNAs-co-expressed mRNAs indicated that the biological modules were correlated with chromosome organization, extracellular region and guanylate cyclase activator activity in the vaso-obliteration phase, and correlated with cell proliferation, extracellular region and guanylate cyclase regulator activity in the neovascularization phase. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that MAPK signaling was the most significantly enriched pathway in both phases. Importantly, Vax2os1 and Vax2os2 were not only dynamically expressed in the vaso-obliteration and neovascularization phases, but also significantly altered in the aqueous humor of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), suggesting a potential role of lncRNAs in the regulation of ocular neovascularization. Taken together, this study provided novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ocular neovascularization. The intervention of dysregulated lncRNA could become a potential target for the prevention and treatment of ocular vascular diseases.
