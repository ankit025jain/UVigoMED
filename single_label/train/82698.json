{"id":82698,"title":"Spindle cell lipoma of the mandibular mucogingival junction: a case report of unusual oral neoplasm.","abstract":"Spindle cell lipoma (SCL) is a benign lipomatous neoplasm typically located in the posterior neck and back of older males. It presents as a well-circumscribed mass in the buccal mucosa, tongue, floor of the mouth or hard palate. There are only two case reports of SCL in the gingiva and alveolar ridge. Here, we report a case of SCL in the mandibular mucogingival junction of a 68-year-old male. Clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings are presented. Although oral SCL is rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell neoplasms occurring in the oral cavity.
