{"id":80306,"title":"Taenia multiceps brain cyst removal in two wild Nubian ibex (Capra nubianas).","abstract":"Two wild adult Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) were captured and admitted to the Hebrew University Veterinary Teaching Hospital with various neurologic signs, including alerted mentation, head tilt, and pathologic nystagmus. The lesion in the central nervous system was localized to the forebrain in one ibex and to the cerebellum of the other. Both ibex's were diagnosed with brain cyst using computed tomography (CT). Craniectomy was performed to remove the cysts, and both animals returned to their natural environment after a rehabilitation period. Parasitologic examination revealed cysts of Taenia multiceps coenurus. This is the first report to describe the neurologic signs, CT findings, surgical procedure, and follow-up postsurgery information in wild Capra nubiana.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712185","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Pathologic nystagmus","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_nystagmus"},{"name":"Decompressive craniectomy","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompressive_craniectomy"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.810215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.714493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.499584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.299542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Forebrain","weight":0.267195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forebrain"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem"}]}
