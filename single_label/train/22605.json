{"id":22605,"title":"Synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of amide derivatives of benzodifuran-2-carboxylic acid.","abstract":"We have synthesized various amide derivatives of benzodifuran-2-carboxylic acid from resorcinol. Reaction of 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin with chloroacetone in anhydrous K2CO3 and dry acetone gave ether derivative of 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin 3 which on reaction with N-bromosuccinimide in chloroform gave corresponding 3-bromo derivative 4. Cyclization of bromo derivative in 10% ethanolic KOH gave benzodifuran-2-carboxylic acid 5. This acid was converted into acid chloride using oxalyl chloride and then substituted with different amines in presence of base, triethylamine to give amide derivatives of benzodifuran-2-carboxylic acid 6. All compounds were screened for antimicrobial activity against two Gram positive bacteria Staphylococus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, two Gram negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa and one fungus Candida albicans.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530493","annotations":[{"name":"Gram-negative bacteria","weight":0.912788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria"},{"name":"Carboxylic acid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid"},{"name":"Acyl chloride","weight":0.902221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyl_chloride"},{"name":"Bromine","weight":0.898005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine"},{"name":"Chloroform","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"},{"name":"Triethylamine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triethylamine"},{"name":"Acetone","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Amide","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide"},{"name":"Gram-positive bacteria","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-positive_bacteria"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.783055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Anhydrous","weight":0.775701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhydrous"},{"name":"Resorcinol","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resorcinol"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Ether","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether"},{"name":"Potassium hydroxide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Cyclic compound","weight":0.678288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.599778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Substitution reaction","weight":0.563859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_reaction"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Bacillus subtilis","weight":0.436055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_subtilis"},{"name":"Oxalyl chloride","weight":0.368637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalyl_chloride"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.178294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0229109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
