{"id":65432,"title":"CtBP2 could promote prostate cancer cell proliferation through c-Myc signaling.","abstract":"C-terminal binding protein-2 (CtBP2) is a CtBP-family member which plays a significant role in tumor initiation, progression and response to therapy. However, little has been known about the potential oncobiological role of CtBP2 and its mechanism in human prostate cancer. In this study, we observed the overexpression of CtBP2 in prostate cancer and demonstrated that its expression was closely correlated with several malignant behaviors, e.g., increased serum PSA level, advanced tumor stage (T3), higher Gleason scores and poor outcome. Furthermore, downregulation of CtBP2 expression in prostate cancer PC3 cells could markedly inhibit their proliferation by inducing apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, CtBP2 inhibition could decrease the level of c-Myc and its direct transcriptional target, HSPC111. Taken together, our investigations demonstrated that low-expression of CtBP2 could highly inhibit proliferation of prostate cancer by c-Myc induced signaling, suggesting that targeting CtBP2 may yield a viable anti-tumor strategy by restraining tumor progression in prostate cancer.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24835310","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.597988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.522917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.412444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.329779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.329308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.240107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"}]}
