{"id":73218,"title":"[The use of SPECT-CT in the diagnosis of cancerous lesions of axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer].","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to explore the possibilities of a new hybrid technology of SPECT-CT in the diagnosis of metastatic regional lymph nodes (LN) in patients with breast cancer (BC). There were examined 57 primary patients. All patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection and /or biopsy of sentinel LN followed by histological examination of the material. Metastases in LN were verified in 20 (35%) of 57 examined patients. Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of SPECT-CT in the combined use of anatomical and functional criteria for assessing the state of LN accounted for 75%, 89% and 84%, respectively. Sensitivity of SPECT-CT in the diagnosis of massive axillary LN lesion (more than two) in breast cancer patients was 95%. Thus, the new hybrid technology of SPECT-CT, combining functional and anatomical techniques for assessing of pathological changes, is highly informative in the diagnosis of metastatic lesions of regional LN in patients with breast cancer.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919262","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.752763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.323585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.24872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
