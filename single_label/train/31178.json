{"id":31178,"title":"Design and optimization of self-nanoemulsifying delivery system to enhance quercetin hepatoprotective activity in paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity.","abstract":"The present study aimed to develop optimized quercetin (QT)-loaded self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) that offers protective effect against liver damage. Solubility study of QT in different oils, surfactants, and cosurfactants was performed. Ternary phase mixtures of the selected components were constructed to select a suitable range for each component. Experimental mixture design was utilized to optimize SNEDDSs that possess smaller globule size with enhanced emulsification and dissolution rates. QT SNEDDS was compared with QT suspension control and silymarin. In vivo evaluation and histopatholgical study of the selected QT SNEDDSs were achieved after administration of paracetamol over dosage to albino rats. Two optimized formulations were selected; one based on Sefsol and the other based on linoleic acid as an oily phase, Tween(Â®) 80 and polyethylene glycol 400 as surfactant and cosurfactant, respectively. Both Sefsol and linoleic-acid-optimized SNEDDS formulation showed no symptoms associated with toxicity and offered protective effect against paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity by scavenging free radicals, attenuating lipid peroxidation, and enhancing the activity of antioxidants. The histopatholgical observations revealed that the inflammatory infiltrations induced by paracetamol were significantly ameliorated.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24395640","annotations":[{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Surfactant","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"},{"name":"Linoleic acid","weight":0.896074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.611027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.46174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Vegetable fats and oils","weight":0.451825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_fats_and_oils"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Silibinin","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.37038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.355971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.2682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Polysorbate 80","weight":0.174844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysorbate_80"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.174422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Scavenger (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_formulation"},{"name":"Drop (liquid)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_(liquid)"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"}]}
