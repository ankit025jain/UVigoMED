{"id":69129,"title":"Evolution of the Southampton Enhanced Recovery Programme for radical cystectomy and the aggregation of marginal gains.","abstract":"To describe and assess the evolution of an enhanced recovery programme (ERP) for open radical cystectomy.We introduced a mentored ERP for radical cystectomy in January 2011. The programme underwent service evaluation and multiple changes in August 2012 that we define as marginal gains. We present a retrospective review of 133 consecutive patients undergoing open radical cystectomy, grouped according to the three stages of the ERP from October 2008 to April 2013: (1) non-ERP group (October 2008 to December 2010): n = 69; (2) ERP-1 group (January 2011 to July 2012): n = 37; and (3) ERP-2 group (August 2012 to April 2013): n = 27. Primary outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOS), readmission, morbidity at 90 days using the Clavien classification system and mortality. Secondary outcomes were time to flatus, ileus rates, re-operation rates and oncological outcomes.There were no differences in patient demographics among any of the groups for: age, gender, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists score and the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. There were no differences in readmission, morbidity and mortality rates. The overall 90-day mortality was six patients (4.5%). There were significant differences in ileus rates between the non-ERP, the ERP-1 and the ERP-2 groups: 44.9% (31 patients), 29.7% (11 patients) and 14.8% (four patients), respectively (P = 0.017). There was a significant difference in the presence of pathological lymphadenopathy in the ERP-2 group: non-ERP group, 10.1%; ERP-1 group, 16.2%; and ERP-2 group, 44.4%; P = 0.002. There was also a difference in the mean (sd) lymph node yield in ERP-2: non-ERP group, 8.4 (5.4) nodes; ERP-1, 8.2 (6.4) nodes; and ERP-2, 16.7 (5.4) nodes (P < 0.001). The median (range) LOS was 14 (7-91) days, 10 (6-55) days and 7 (3-99) days in the non-ERP, ERP-1 and ERP-2 groups, respectively (P < 0.001).Auditing an already successful ERP and implementing a number of marginal gains has led to a significant decrease in the median LOS for radical cystectomy. The LOS for open radical cystectomy at University Hospital Southampton has halved. In the second phase of our ERP, our median LOS is 7 days.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Male Urogenital
