{"id":44949,"title":"Lack of association between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) -1722T/C (rs733618) polymorphism and cancer risk: from a case-control study to a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The association between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) gene -1722T/C polymorphism (rs733618) and cancer has been widely assessed, and a definitive conclusion remains elusive. We first performed a hospital based case-control study to measure this association of esophageal cancer with CTLA-4 -1722T/C polymorphism in Han Chinese population, and then carried out a meta-analysis to obtain a comprehensive evaluation for this issue.This case-control study involved 629 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases and 686 age and gender well matched cancer-free controls. PCR-LDR (polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reactions) method was used to identify genotypes. Meta-analysis was conducted by STATA (v12.0) software. This case-control study showed no significant difference in the genotype and allele distributions of CTLA-4 -1722T/C polymorphism between esophageal cancer cases and control subjects, in accord with the findings of the further meta-analysis in all genetic models. Evidence of large heterogeneity was observed among all eligible studies in the recessive model. Further subgroup analyses by ethnicity, cancer type and system, detected null associations in this meta-analysis.This case-control study and the further meta-analysis, failed to identify the association between CTLA-4 -1722T/C polymorphism and cancer risk.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710335","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.789718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.649337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.571239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.561886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.525607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.495937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.419348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.380205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.369363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"China","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.0387277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"CTLA-4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTLA-4"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Null hypothesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
