{"id":44868,"title":"Multivariate prognostic factors analysis for second-line chemotherapy in advanced biliary tract cancer.","abstract":"The role of second-line chemotherapy (CT) is not established in advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC). We investigated the outcome of aBTC patients treated with second-line CT and devised a prognostic model.Baseline clinical and laboratory data of 300 consecutive aBTC patients were collected and association with overall survival (OS) was investigated by multivariable Cox models.The following parameters resulted independently associated with longer OS: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (P<0.001; hazard ratio (HR), 0.348; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.215-0.562), CA19.9 lower than median (P=0.013; HR, 0.574; 95% CI 0.370-0.891), progression-free survival after first-line CT ? 6 months (P=0.027; HR, 0.633; 95% CI 0.422-0.949) and previous surgery on primary tumour (P=0.027; HR, 0.609; 95% CI 0.392-0.945). We grouped the 249 patients with complete data available into three categories according to the number of fulfilled risk factors: median OS times for good-risk (zero to one factors), intermediate-risk (two factors) and poor-risk (three to four factors) groups were 13.1, 6.6 and 3.7 months, respectively (P<0.001).Easily available clinical and laboratory factors predict prognosis of aBTC patients undergoing second-line CT. This model allows individual patient-risk stratification and may help in treatment decision and trial design.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System
