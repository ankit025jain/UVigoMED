{"id":70236,"title":"The role of microRNAs in the control of innate immune response in cancer.","abstract":"Ligands for receptors of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), such as the inhibitory nonclassical HLA-G, the activating stress-induced major histocompatibility complex class I-related antigens MICA and MICB, and/or the UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs), are often aberrantly expressed upon viral infection and neoplastic transformation, thereby preventing virus-infected or malignant-transformed cells from elimination by immune effector cells. Recently, it has been shown that ligands of both NK and CD8(+) T cells are regulated by a number of cellular and/or viral microRNAs (miRs). These miRs are involved in shaping the antiviral and/or antitumoral immune responses as well as neoplastic growth properties. This review summarizes the expression pattern and function of miRs directed against selected NK and T cell receptor ligands, their putative role in shaping immune surveillance and tumorigenicity, and their clinical relevance. In addition, the potential role of RNA-binding proteins in the post-transcriptional gene regulation of these ligands will be discussed.
