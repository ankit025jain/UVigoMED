{"id":26843,"title":"Clinical and epidemiological assessment of the incidence of arterial hypertension in a permanent medical center.","abstract":"The present study shows the results of monitoring, evaluation and prediction of health status in a patient group with hypertension (HTN) seeking care in a permanent medical center.The study evaluated 144 patients registered at the Permanent Medical Center of the Plugari village, Ia?i County, who were diagnosed with HTN between 2011 and 2013. The study group included 80 male patients with an average age of 51.25 years with a diagnosis of essential hypertension (EHTN) stage I, II or III and 64 female patients (group II), with an average age of 48.4 years.44 patients (30.55% of the total number of patients) were diagnosed with HTN stage I, of whom 27 were female (61.36%) and 17 were male (38.64%); 69 patients (47.93%) had HTN stage II, of whom 21 were female (30.43%) and 48 were male (69.57%), and 31 patients (21.52%) had HTN stage III, of whom 16 were female (51.61%) and 15 were male (48.39%).Patients at high risk for HTN and those with mild and moderate clinical forms were surveyed and were early treated. Economic and social benefits were achieved due to lower hospitalization costs, fewer days of temporary disability and reduced medical retirements. In our study groups, HTA had a higher prevalence, especially in men.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076717","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.78311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.701747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.586032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.369795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.369795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.238398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Welfare","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Center (basketball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Iaido","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iaido"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
