{"id":87183,"title":"Comparison of effects of inhibitors of viral and cellular protein kinases on human cytomegalovirus disruption of nuclear lamina and nuclear egress.","abstract":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) kinase UL97 is required for efficient nuclear lamina disruption during nuclear egress. However, cellular protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in this process in other systems. Comparing the effects of UL97 and cellular kinase inhibitors on HCMV nuclear egress confirms a role for UL97 in lamina disruption and nuclear egress. A pan-PKC inhibitor did not affect lamina disruption but did reduce the number of cytoplasmic capsids more than the number of nuclear capsids.
