{"id":87483,"title":"Bone remodeling after supracondylar humeral fracture in children.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate bone remodeling in treated supracondylar humeral fractures in children. The study was carried out at the Department of Pediatric Surgery of University Hospital Rijeka on 58 patients with an average of 6.2 years, followed up during 1 to 7 years. The Baumann angle of the humerus was measured by five observers on the anteroposterior radiographs of the injured elbow right after the surgery, and on routine follow-up. The results obtained were compared with the results of the Baumann angle on the healthy arm, and statistically processed. There was a significant difference in number of cases that showed an increase of Baumann angle, when related to cases with no change of the angle or its decrease. The mean value change of Baumann angle in cases of its increase was 4.22 degrees and in cases of its decrease 2.65 degrees. Because of relatively low mean values of the angles of remodelation, we concluded that an adequate reduction is essential to prevent malunion in supracondylar humeral fractures.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144995","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.470755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.443781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.436007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.303673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0478254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Rijeka","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijeka"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Pediatric surgery","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_surgery"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Home (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_(Angel)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
