{"id":61235,"title":"Functional deregulation of KIT: link to mast cell proliferative diseases and other neoplasms.","abstract":"In this review, the authors discuss common gain-of-function mutations in the stem cell factor receptor KIT found in mast cell proliferation disorders and summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these transforming mutations may affect KIT structure and function leading to altered downstream signaling and cellular transformation. Drugs targeting KIT have shown mixed success in the treatment of mastocytosis and other hyperproliferative diseases. A brief overview of the most common KIT inhibitors currently used, the reasons for the varied clinical results of such inhibitors and a discussion of potential new strategies are provided.
