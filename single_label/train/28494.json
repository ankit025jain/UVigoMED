{"id":28494,"title":"Quitting patterns and predictors of success among participants in a tobacco cessation program provided by pharmacists in New Mexico.","abstract":"Tobacco use causes hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States each year. Pharmacists are available in the community to provide tobacco cessation interventions. Between 2004 and 2010, the New Mexico Pharmaceutical Care Foundation (NMPCF) provided a pharmacist-led tobacco cessation program to residents in New Mexico.To (a) obtain point prevalence quit rates at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-up for participants enrolled in the NMPCF program; (b) differentiate between the quitting patterns of enrolled participants; and (c) identify predictors associated with the quitting patterns.Seven-year data were combined for the pattern analysis. Four quitting patterns were defined, including immediate quitters, delayed quitters, once quitters, and never quitters. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify characteristics of participants with different quitting patterns.The analysis included 1,437 participants. The average point prevalence quit rate at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months was 29.3%, 23.3%, and 18.0%, respectively. Based on our definition for quitting patterns, the study sample consisted of 145 (10.1%) immediate quitters, 113 (7.9%) delayed quitters, 298 (20.7%) once quitters, and 881 (61.3%) never quitters. Multinomial logistic regression identified associations between quitting patterns and demographics, tobacco use and restrictions, baseline confidence in successful quitting, and pharmacotherapy aids used to quit. Relationships varied between quitting patterns.The study findings showed that having community pharmacists provide smoking cessation interventions resulted in quitting success rates similar to other health care professionals, which ranged from 9.9% to 26.0%. Since pharmacists are a widely available resource for their patients, managed care organizations may be able to improve the health, and avoid subsequent tobacco-related adverse health outcomes, of their members by implementing a program similar to the NMPCF Tobacco Cessation Program.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856596","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.696422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.639916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.587584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.515964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.459635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.454259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"New Mexico","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.326849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.285833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Managed care","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_care"},{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"Point prevalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_prevalence"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"881","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/881"},{"name":"298","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/298"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Pattern recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Quitting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quitting"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Gulf War syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War_syndrome"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"}]}
