{"id":56053,"title":"Refractive surgery for accommodative esotropia: 5-year follow-up.","abstract":"To assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of refractive surgery with LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for treating accommodative esotropia in adults.All patients with accommodative esotropia treated with LASIK or PRK until December 2007 and with a minimum follow-up of 5 years were retrospectively included.LASIK was performed on 44 eyes of 22 patients (12 women, 10 men; mean age: 22.7 ± 2.9 years). Mean postoperative follow-up was 62.1 ± 3.2 months. PRK was performed on 16 eyes of 8 patients (4 women, 4 men; mean age: 23.7 ± 1.7 years). Mean postoperative follow-up was 61.3 ± 2.8 months. At the 5-year follow-up, the mean cycloplegic refraction was more hyperopic in the PRK group (0.3 ± 0.8 vs 0.06 ± 0.3 diopters, P = .01). Correction of esotropia to esophoria or orthotropia was present in 21 patients (95.4%) treated with LASIK and in all patients treated with PRK.Both LASIK and PRK were effective in the long-term reduction of accommodative esotropia.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763477","annotations":[{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.861631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Hyperopia","weight":0.816944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia"},{"name":"Refractive surgery","weight":0.771716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_surgery"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.628461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.627113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Cycloplegia","weight":0.609609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloplegia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.605537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Esotropia","weight":0.345962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotropia"},{"name":"Esophoria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophoria"},{"name":"Accommodation (eye)","weight":0.0296383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_(eye)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Photorefractive effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_effect"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
