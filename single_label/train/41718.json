{"id":41718,"title":"Utilization of colonoscopy and pathology reports for identifying patients meeting the world health organization criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome.","abstract":"Serrated polyposis syndrome is a rare syndrome associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer. The World Health Organization criteria were established to standardize the diagnosis and management of patients afflicted with serrated polyposis. Although useful, the criteria may not be ideal for the initial screening of at-risk populations.The aim of this study was to examine the use of a minimal cutoff point of serrated lesions to increase the yield of serrated polyposis cases.This was a retrospective review of colonoscopy and pathology reports to identify patients who met the World Health Organization criteria for serrated polyposis.This study was conducted at a tertiary cancer care referral center.Five hundred patients who had at least 2 pathologically confirmed hyperplastic polyps and/or sessile serrated adenomas/polyps diagnosed between 1999 and 2009 were assessed.The primary outcome measure was the number of serrated polyposis cases.Forty of the 500 (8%) patients met the World Health Organization criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome. Patients underwent a median of 4 colonoscopies (range, 1-23) before satisfying the criteria, and only 1 (3%) patient met the criteria for diagnosis during the initial colonoscopy. All 16 patients with a history of colorectal cancer were only diagnosed with serrated polyposis either at the time of their cancer diagnosis or during postoperative colonoscopies. Only 5 of the 40 (13%) patients were enrolled in our institutional Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Family Registry before our study for prospective serrated lesion tracking and colorectal cancer screening.This tool requires validation in a prospective setting.The cutoff point of at least 2 pathologically confirmed serrated lesions can serve as a screening tool for identifying patients meeting the World Health Organization criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome who would otherwise go undetected.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901685","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.863472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.456724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.427476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.38892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Polyposis","weight":0.308467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyposis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Health organization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_organization"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"}]}
