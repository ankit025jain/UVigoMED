{"id":17124,"title":"[Effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assays in the tuberculosis contact investigation of elderly people].","abstract":"To confirm the effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) in the tuberculosis (TB) contact investigation of elderly people, we analyzed the results of the QuantiFERON TB Gold in tube (QFT-3G) test, which is a commercially available IGRA.We analyzed the results of the QFT-3G test in 2,420 subjects who were in close contact with TB patients. We investigated subjects with latent TB infection and those showing the onset of TB among the QFT-3G-positive subjects.The QFT-3G-positive rate was 7.3% (95% confidence interval, 6.2%-8.3%). In addition, we demonstrated that the QFT-3G-positive rate increased with age (P < 0.001).The QFT-3G-positive rate was high, particularly in elderly people (> or = 60 years), but the rate was significantly lower than the predicted prevalence of TB infection. Therefore, it was assumed that the QFT-3G test does not always provide a positive result, even in cases of subjects with a previous TB infection. Furthermore, data from the QFT-3G-positive subjects indicated that approximately one half of subjects aged 60-69 years, approximately one-third of those aged 70-79 years, and approximately one-quarter of those aged over 80 years have had recent TB infections. In conclusion, the results of the QFT-3G test in elderly people need to be carefully evaluated according to the contact situation with TB patients; nevertheless, the QFT-3G test is useful for the screening of latent TB infection in elderly people who were in close contact with TB patients.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908811","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.817072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.594771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"3G","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"},{"name":"QuantiFERON","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuantiFERON"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Tuberculosis diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Quantum field theory","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory"}]}
