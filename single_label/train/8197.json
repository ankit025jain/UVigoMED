{"id":8197,"title":"Pathology of US porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain PC21A in gnotobiotic pigs.","abstract":"To understand the progression of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection, we inoculated gnotobiotic pigs with a newly emerged US strain, PC21A, of the virus. At 24â€“48 hours postinoculation, the pigs exhibited severe diarrhea and vomiting, fecal shedding, viremia, and severe atrophic enteritis. These findings confirm that strain PC21A is highly enteropathogenic.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795932","annotations":[{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.697924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Enteritis","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteritis"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.542891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.275466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"New islands","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_islands"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"Moulting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting"}]}
