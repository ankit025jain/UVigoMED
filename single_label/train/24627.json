{"id":24627,"title":"[Who observes out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Germany?].","abstract":"It still remains unknown why there are so poor rates of lay-resuscitation in Germany. We wanted to find out who observes the out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) in Germany.All patients who were admitted in our hospital between January, 1st 2008 and December, 31st 2013 following non-traumatic OHCA were identified and the patients' data were stored on a central data base.Data on 204 patients (124 male [60,8?%], 80 female [39,2?%], aged 69,1?±?14,2 years [range 18-97 years]) were analysed. Altogether, 137 OHCA were witnessed (67,2?%): 83 cases (40,7?%) by laypersons and 54 further cases (26,5?%) by medical professionals. Among laypersons, most OHCA were witnessed by the partner (17,2?%) and further relatives (11,8?%) but resuscitation rates among partner (3,9?%) and relatives (5,9?%) were poor. Altogether, immediate resuscitation attempts were started in 93 patients, hereunder in 35 cases (17,2?%) by layperson and 58 cases (28,4?%) by medical professionals.Rates of lay-resuscitation remain poor despite high rates of witnessed events: unfortunately, especially partner and relatives act too rarely. However, the motivation to approve their knowledge in first-aid and resuscitation might rise among lays if they are informed that it is more likely to observe a partner's or relative´s OHCA than a stranger's.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25334073","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.495686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.318828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.208523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Layman","weight":0.0829597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layman"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"January 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_31"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"1897","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1897"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Crime statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_statistics"},{"name":"Military base","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_base"},{"name":"Underdevelopment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdevelopment"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Laity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity"}]}
