{"id":39000,"title":"5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) cellular sequestration during chronic exposure delays 5-HT3 receptor resensitization due to its subsequent release.","abstract":"The serotonergic synapse is dynamically regulated by serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) with elevated levels leading to the down-regulation of the serotonin transporter and a variety of 5-HT receptors, including the 5-HT type-3 (5-HT3) receptors. We report that recombinantly expressed 5-HT3 receptor binding sites are reduced by chronic exposure to 5-HT (IC50 of 154.0 ± 45.7 ?M, t½ = 28.6 min). This is confirmed for 5-HT3 receptor-induced contractions in the guinea pig ileum, which are down-regulated after chronic, but not acute, exposure to 5-HT. The loss of receptor function does not involve endocytosis, and surface receptor levels are unaltered. The rate and extent of down-regulation is potentiated by serotonin transporter function (IC50 of 2.3 ± 1.0 ?M, t½ = 3.4 min). Interestingly, the level of 5-HT uptake correlates with the extent of down-regulation. Using TX-114 extraction, we find that accumulated 5-HT remains soluble and not membrane-bound. This cytoplasmically sequestered 5-HT is readily releasable from both COS-7 cells and the guinea pig ileum. Moreover, the 5-HT level released is sufficient to prevent recovery from receptor desensitization in the guinea pig ileum. Together, these findings suggest the existence of a novel mechanism of down-regulation where the chronic release of sequestered 5-HT prolongs receptor desensitization.","date":"2014-11-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281748","annotations":[{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.921307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Serotonin transporter","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_transporter"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Serotonergic","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonergic"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.773912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"5-HT3 receptor","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT3_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.608692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.591466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.377582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.328267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Allosteric regulation","weight":0.279334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosteric_regulation"},{"name":"Guinea pig","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.211135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.172373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.151211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0894997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Texas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"}]}
