{"id":82438,"title":"Proposing a novel protocol for halitosis assessment.","abstract":"This is a review paper intended to develop a simple protocol for the comprehensive yet rapid assessment of halitosis.An extensive protocol was developed through a review of literature to identify all possible etiological factors as have been identified by previous workers. The resulting protocol was presented as a form including extensive medical and dental history as well as oral and periodontal examination. Relevant medical aspects, an otolaryngology (ENT) consultation section as well as a gastrointestinal consultation were also included. Every bit of evidence gathered from literature was included in order to develop a list that's as inclusive of all possible contributing factors as possible. Factors discovered from the experience of the authors were also included in the protocol.A long list of factors was identified in literature including medical, dental, periodontal, diet and others. All these were included in the resulting form and a pre-evaluation checklist was also included.Halitosis is multifaceted in etiology. A simple easy-to-use protocol helps in an extensive yet rapid evaluation of halitosis.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624640","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.475208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.279314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Halitosis","weight":0.178312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halitosis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.159749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.13895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Checklist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"},{"name":"Review journal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_journal"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Bit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Public consultation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_consultation"}]}
