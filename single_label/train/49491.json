{"id":49491,"title":"Assessment of antioxidant supplementation on the neuropathic pain score and quality of life in diabetic neuropathy patients - a randomized controlled study.","abstract":"Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. The appropriate goals in the management of diabetes include maintaining blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible, minimizing the adverse effects of free radicals by enhancing antioxidant defenses. Supplementation with appropriate vitamins may therefore be of value in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.A total of 92 patients with diabetic neuropathy were enrolled in this randomized controlled study from the general medicine department of a tertiary care hospital. Patients were randomized into two groups viz., usual care (n = 46) and intervention group (n = 46). Usual care group patients received pregabalin with oral hypoglycemic agents. Patients in the intervention group received vitamin-E along with their regular medicines. Pain intensity and quality of life (QoL) of patients were assessed using Neuropathy Pain Score and RAND 36 questionnaire. Blood samples were analyzed for the levels of random blood sugar level and HbA(1c) at the baseline and on the 12th week.Significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the random blood sugar level was observed in intervention group when compared with the usual care group and a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in total pain score, and a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in physical health after 12 week treatment of vitamin-E was observed.The study concluded that vitamin-E is a natural antioxidant and it is found to be effective in reducing pain score in diabetic neuropathy patients. The future studies may be directed towards extended duration of action.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905305","annotations":[{"name":"Pregabalin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.729417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.7269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Neuropathic pain","weight":0.711048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.494288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.491302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.310276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Sugars in wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugars_in_wine"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
