{"id":19185,"title":"Risk factors for pneumococcal carriage in day care centers: a retrospective study during a 10-year period.","abstract":"In this retrospective epidemiologic study, we present pneumococcal carriage data from 109 Swedish day care centers over a period of 10 years. Aspects of season, age, personnel and group size were studied. We found a significant seasonal variation in pneumococcal carriage. Group size was a significant risk factor for pneumococcal carriage. Pneumococcal carriage was 4.5 % in personnel.
