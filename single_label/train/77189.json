{"id":77189,"title":"Oral magnesium supplementation improves the metabolic profile of metabolically obese, normal-weight individuals: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"We undertook this study to determine the efficacy of oral magnesium supplementation in the improvement of the metabolic profile and blood pressure in metabolically obese, normal-weight (MONW) individuals.A total of 47 MONW individuals with hypomagnesemia were enrolled in clinical a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Individuals in the intervention group received 30 mL of MgCl2 5% solution (equivalent to 382 mg of magnesium) and individuals in the control group 30 mL of placebo solution, once daily during 4 months. In the absence of obesity or overweight, the presence of fasting glucose levels ?100 mg/dL, HOMA-IR index ?3, triglyceride levels ?150 mg/dL and/or systolic and diastolic blood pressure ?140 and 90 mmHg defined the presence of the MONW phenotype. Hypomagnesemia was defined by serum magnesium concentration ?1.8 mg/dL.At basal conditions there were no significant differences between groups. At the end of follow-up, changes in the mean of systolic (-2.1 vs. 3.9% mmHg, p <0.05) and diastolic (-3.8 vs. 7.5% mmHg, p <0.05) blood pressures, HOMA-IR index (-46.5 vs. -5.4%, p <0.0001), fasting glucose (-12.3 vs. -1.8% mg/dL, p <0.05) and triglyceride levels (-47.4% vs. 10.1% mg/dL, p <0.0001) were significantly lower in the subjects who received MgCl2 compared with individuals in the control group.Oral magnesium supplementation improves the metabolic profile and blood pressure of MONW individuals.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830937","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.839721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.652683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.54117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.474518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.44672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.294432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Hypomagnesemia","weight":0.285607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomagnesemia"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.261899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.174844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Blood Pressures","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Pressures"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
