{"id":22221,"title":"Vaccine against tuberculosis: what's new?","abstract":"one of the World Health Organization Millennium Development Goal is to reduce tuberculosis incidence by 2015. However, more of 8.5 million tuberculosis cases have been reported in 2011, with an increase of multidrug-resistant strains. Therefore, the World Health Organization target cannot be reach without the help of a vaccine able to limit the spread of tuberculosis. Nowadays, bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin is the only vaccine available against tuberculosis. It prevents against meningeal and disseminated tuberculosis in children, but its effectiveness against pulmonary form in adolescents and adults is argued.a systematic review was performed by searches of Pubmed, references of the relevant articles and Aeras and ClinicalTrial.gov websites.100 articles were included in this review. Three viral vectored booster vaccines, five protein adjuvant booster vaccines, two priming vaccines and two therapeutic vaccines have been analyzed.Several vaccines are in the pipeline, but further studies on basic research, clinical trial and mass vaccination campaigns are needed to achieve the TB eradication target by 2050.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564340","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.725549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Millennium Development Goals","weight":0.69991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.668416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.560464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.487328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.430486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Meninges","weight":0.31664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.150837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Aeras","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeras"},{"name":"Pipeline transport","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport"},{"name":"Pure research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_research"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"}]}
