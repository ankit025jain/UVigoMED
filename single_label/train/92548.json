{"id":92548,"title":"Total hip replacement due to primary osteoarthritis in relation to cumulative occupational exposures and lifestyle factors: a nationwide nested case-control study.","abstract":"To investigate the risk of total hip replacement (THR) due to primary osteoarthritis in relation to cumulative occupational mechanical exposures and lifestyle factors.Using register information, we identified first-time THR cases within the Danish working population in 2005-2006. For each case, 2 age- and sex-matched controls were drawn. Persons within 2,500 randomly selected case-control sets received a questionnaire about job history, weight at age 25 years, present weight and height, smoking, and sports activities at age 25 years. The job history was combined with a job exposure matrix. Cumulative exposure estimates were expressed according to the pack-year concept of smoking (e.g., cumulative lifting was expressed as ton-years). We used conditional logistic regression for statistical analyses.In total, 1,776 case-control sets (71%) were available for analysis. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for exposure to ?20 ton-years was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.05-1.74) for men and 1.00 (95% CI 0.73-1.41) for women. Standing/walking and whole body vibration showed no associations. The adjusted OR for body mass index (BMI) ?30 kg/m(2) at age 25 years was 2.44 (95% CI 1.38-4.32) for men and 5.12 (95% CI 2.30-11.39) for women. The corresponding adjusted ORs for an increase in BMI of ?10 kg/m(2) since age 25 years were 2.16 (95% CI 1.25-3.70) and 2.46 (95% CI 1.47-4.13). Sports participation showed weak positive associations, while pack-years of smoking showed no associations.The results indicated a modest increase in risk of THR in relation to cumulative lifting among men and an increased risk in relation to a high BMI at age 25 years and to a gain in BMI in both sexes.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Musculoskeletal
