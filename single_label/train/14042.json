{"id":14042,"title":"Structure and biological properties of lentztrehalose: a novel trehalose analog.","abstract":"A new trehalose analog, lentztrehalose [4-O-(2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)trehalose], was isolated from an actinomycete Lentzea sp. Lentztrehalose is only weakly hydrolyzed by the trehalose-hydrolyzing enzyme, trehalase, so can be regarded as an enzyme-stable analog of trehalose. Although lentztrehalose does not show apparent toxicity to mammalian cells and microbes, it has antitumor activity in mice bearing S-180 sarcoma and Ehrlich carcinoma cells. In ovariectomized mice, lentztrehalose displayed a bone reinforcement effect in the femur that was superior to trehalose and induced non-morbid suppression of weight gain comparable with trehalose. These results indicate that enzyme-stable analogs of trehalose, such as lentztrehalose, may be more beneficial for human health and thus have potential as substitutes for trehalose as a sweetener.
