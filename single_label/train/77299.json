{"id":77299,"title":"[Study on prevalence of occupational musculoskeletal disorders and their risk factors among workers in three industries in Zhongshan, China].","abstract":"To determine the prevalence of occupational musculoskeletal disorders (OMSD) and its risk factors among workers in three manufacturing industries in Zhongshan, China by cross-sectional epidemiological investigation.A total of 2 035 workers from the industries of metals (1001 persons), electrical appliances (455 persons), and furniture (579 persons), including 1 402 males and 633 females, were selected; the mean age was 32.9 ± 8.2 years, and the mean length of service was 6.4 ± 5.6 years. A revised Northern Europe Standardized Questionnaire was used for cross-sectional epidemiological investigation of OMSD.The results showed that OMSD in these workers was primarily located in the neck, waist, and shoulder, with annual prevalence rates of 23.1%, 20.1%, and 15.8%, respectively. The overall prevalence of OMSD was 43.1% in metal industry, 44.0% in electrical appliance industry, and 26.6% in furniture industry. OMSD prevalence showed significant differences between different industries (?(2) = 54.2, P < 0.01). The prevalence of OMSD in the shoulder and back increased with working years (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for OMSD were working age >10 years, safety behavior such as \"bending down when lifting heavy things from the ground\", and different types of industries.OMSD is mainly manifested by neck pain, waist pain, and shoulder pain among front-line manufacturing workers in Zhongshan, and working age, poor labor posture, and different types of industries were risk factors for waist pain.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25169222","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.754166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.573927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.572813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.523819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.397777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.389795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Furniture","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"Metalworking","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Small appliance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_appliance"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Zhongshan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Home appliance","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"}]}
