{"id":86754,"title":"Effect of vitamin D-binding protein genotype on the development of asthma in children.","abstract":"Potential vitamin D-related influences on inflammatory diseases such as asthma are controversial, including the suggestion that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased asthma morbidity. Vitamin D-binding protein transports vitamin D metabolites in the circulation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the GC gene encoding vitamin D-binding protein are associated with circulating vitamin D metabolite levels in healthy infants and toddlers.To test the hypothesis that GC single nucleotide polymorphisms encoding the D432E and T436K variants predict subsequent development of asthma in healthy children.A retrospective medical record review was performed to determine the development of asthma in 776 children in whom GC genotype, vitamin D-binding protein concentration, and circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D had been determined at 6 to 36 months of age. Demographic and detailed current clinical data were collected and criteria for asthma were recorded.GC genotype was available for 463 subjects. After an initial analysis of all subject data, the analysis was limited to the predominant Hispanic population (72.1%) to minimize potential confounding effects of ethnicity. Asthma was diagnosed in 87 children (26%). Subjects with the GC genotype encoding the ET/ET (Gc1s/Gc1s) variant had lower odds of developing asthma, representing a protective effect compared with subjects with the DT/DT (Gc1f/Gc1f) variant.In the Hispanic population of inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, the ET/ET (Gc1s/Gc1s) genotype of vitamin D-binding protein might confer protection against the development of asthma compared with the wild-type genotype DT/DT (Gc1f/Gc1f).","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745702","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin
