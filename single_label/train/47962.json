{"id":47962,"title":"Prevalence of resistant occipital lobe epilepsy associated with celiac disease in children.","abstract":"Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disorder caused by intolerance to ingested gluten. Increased frequency of CD has been reported in occipital lobe epilepsy. The aim of the present study is to investigate the frequency of CD among children followed up due to epilepsy and diagnosed with epileptic activity in the occipital lobe in at least one electroencephalography (EEG) test.For this research, 90 pediatric epilepsy patients with epileptic activity in the occipital lobe were enrolled in the study group, while the control group comprised of 100 healthy children. In addition to the EEG examination, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody was determined on duodenal biopsy.None of the healthy children in the control group was positive in terms of the tTG antibody test used to scan CD. In the group with epileptic activity in the occipital lobe, two patients out of 90 were tTG antibody positive. The seroprevalence was 1/45 (2.22 %) in this group. These two patients were diagnosed with CD based on the endoscopic duodenal biopsy. In these patients, the seizures were uncontrollable through monotherapy.Our results showed that the prevalence of CD is observed to be higher than the normal population among the patients with occipital lobe epilepsy. This type of seizure disorder seems to be more resistant to monotherapy, compared with other types of occipital epilepsy. Therefore, screening for CD is recommended in children with resistant epileptic activity in the occipital lobe.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566676","annotations":[{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.717004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.666623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Gluten","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.638055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.499803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.493689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.357346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Transglutaminase","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transglutaminase"},{"name":"Tissue transglutaminase","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_transglutaminase"},{"name":"Occipital lobe","weight":0.218357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.217446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.147589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Food intolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
