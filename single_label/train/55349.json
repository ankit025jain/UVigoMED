{"id":55349,"title":"Photoreceptor perturbation around subretinal drusenoid deposits as revealed by adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy.","abstract":"To describe the microscopic structure of photoreceptors impacted by subretinal drusenoid deposits, also called pseudodrusen, an extracellular lesion associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO).Observational case series.We recruited 53 patients with AMD and 10 age-similar subjects who had normal retinal health. All subjects underwent color fundus photography, infrared reflectance, red-free reflectance, autofluorescence, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Subretinal drusenoid deposits were classified by a 3-stage OCT-based grading system. Lesions and surrounding photoreceptors were examined by AOSLO.Subretinal drusenoid deposits were found in 26 eyes of 13 patients with AMD and imaged by AOSLO and spectral-domain OCT in 18 eyes (n = 342 lesions). Spectral-domain OCT showed subretinal drusenoid deposits as highly reflective material accumulated internal to the retinal pigment epithelium. AOSLO revealed that photoreceptor reflectivity was qualitatively reduced by stage 1 subretinal drusenoid deposits and was greatly reduced by stage 2. AOSLO presented a distinct structure in stage 3, a hyporeflective annulus consisting of deflected, degenerated or absent photoreceptors. A central core with a reflectivity superficially resembling photoreceptors is formed by the lesion material itself. A hyporeflective gap in the photoreceptor ellipsoid zone on either side of this core shown in spectral-domain OCT corresponded to the hyporeflective annulus seen by AOSLO.AOSLO and multimodal imaging of subretinal drusenoid deposits indicate solid, space-filling lesions in the subretinal space. Associated retinal reflectivity changes are related to lesion stages and are consistent with perturbations to photoreceptors, as suggested by histology.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907433","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Adaptive optics","weight":0.841418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.838542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.763079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.753378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.720168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Ellipsoid","weight":0.560932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid"},{"name":"Ophthalmoscopy","weight":0.512416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmoscopy"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.473598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.334241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Reflectivity","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectivity"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.12065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Annulus (mathematics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_laser_ophthalmoscopy"},{"name":"Autofluorescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofluorescence"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Transverse mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_mode"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
