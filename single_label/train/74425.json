{"id":74425,"title":"Treatment of insomnia with hypnotics resulting in improved sexual functioning in post-menopausal women.","abstract":"This study sought to determine whether trazodone used in hypnotic doses, compared to the hypnotic agent zopiclone, had any specific positive effect on sexual function in non-depressive post-menopausal women with insomnia.Fifty (50) subjects participated in the study. Insomnia and sexual performance were evaluated before and after 4 weeks of hypnotic treatment.At week four, both treatments improved sleep quality to a similar degree. Sexual function also improved significantly with both treatments, with no significant difference between the groups.In post-menopausal women, sexual problems and sleep problems may be related and solving sleep problems may help sexual functioning, independently of depression.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377370","annotations":[{"name":"Trazodone","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trazodone"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Hypnotic","weight":0.74294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.716565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Zopiclone","weight":0.598088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zopiclone"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.413135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.377511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Sexual attraction","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
