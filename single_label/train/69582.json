{"id":69582,"title":"Nutritional therapy, phosphate control and renal protection.","abstract":"Dietary management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) focusses on limiting the intake of substances that might accumulate to toxic levels (such as potassium, phosphorus or salt) and, although still a matter of debate for some, restricting dietary protein to retard kidney damage. Recent evidence brings the opportunity to revisit the role of a healthy diet on disease progression and on some of the cardiometabolic complications of moderate/advanced CKD, such as inflammation or oxidative stress control. This review provides a brief overview of dietary strategies that delay CKD progression and CKD complications, and discusses currently limited data addressing the development of malnutrition and protein-energy wasting before dialysis initiation.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434650","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Phosphorus","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.568416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Healthy diet","weight":0.469809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.335547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Protein (nutrient)","weight":0.189263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)"},{"name":"Cachexia","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cachexia"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
