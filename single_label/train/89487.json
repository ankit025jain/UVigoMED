{"id":89487,"title":"Phloroglucinol inhibits ultraviolet B radiation-induced oxidative stress in the mouse skin.","abstract":"Previously we demonstrated that phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) protected human HaCaT keratinocytes against ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-320 nm)-induced oxidative stress in vitro by scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The current study investigated whether phloroglucinol could similarly protect the mouse skin against UVB-induced oxidative tissue damage in vivo.Male 7-week-old Balb/c mice were divided into the following untreated normal control, phloroglucinol only-treated, vehicle plus UVB (30 or 60 mJ/cm(2))-exposed, and phloroglucinol (10 or 50 mg/ml) plus UVB (30 or 60 mJ/cm(2))-treated groups. Following UVB exposure, phloroglucinol or phosphate buffered saline vehicle was applied to the dorsal skin of each mouse daily for 3 days. Studies were conducted at 24 h after the last of the UVB exposures. Histopathological analyses of dorsal skin lesions were performed on all mice. In addition, the levels of UVB-provoked injury to cellular components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids were detected by levels of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), protein carbonyls, and 8-isoprostane. Apoptosis were assessed by using western blot for B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (Bax) and activated caspase-3 expression, by using immunohistochemistry.UVB radiation increased the thickness of the epidermis and the dermis, and also stimulated the accumulation of mast cells in the irradiated skin. However, treatment with phloroglucinol significantly decreased all of these parameters. Furthermore, phloroglucinol decreased UVB-provoked injury to cellular components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids; down-regulated the expression of phospho-histone H2A.X in the injured skin; and reduced the UVB-generated levels of 8-oxoG, protein carbonyls, and 8-isoprostane, which are all markers of oxidative stress. In addition, phloroglucinol attenuated the UVB-induced expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax protein, and activated caspase-3.These results suggest that phloroglucinol safeguards the mouse skin against UVB-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Wounds and
