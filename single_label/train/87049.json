{"id":87049,"title":"Household use of insecticide consumer products in a dengue-endemic area in México.","abstract":"To evaluate the household use of insecticide consumer products to kill mosquitoes and other insect pests, as well as the expenditures for using these products, in a dengue-endemic area of México.A questionnaire was administered to 441 households in Mérida City and other communities in Yucatán to assess household use of insecticide consumer products.A total of 86.6% of surveyed households took action to kill insect pests with consumer products. The most commonly used product types were insecticide aerosol spray cans (73.6%), electric plug-in insecticide emitters (37.4%) and mosquito coils (28.3%). Mosquitoes were targeted by 89.7% of households using insecticide aerosol spray cans and >99% of households using electric plug-in insecticide emitters or mosquito coils. Products were used daily or every 2 days in most of the households for insecticide aerosol spray cans (61.4%), electric plug-in insecticide emitters (76.2%) and mosquito coils (82.1%). For all products used to kill insect pests, the median annual estimated expenditure per household that took action was 408 Mexican pesos ($MXN), which corresponded to approximately 31 $US. These numbers are suggestive of an annual market in excess of 75 million $MXN (>5.7 million $US) for Mérida City alone.Mosquitoes threaten human health and are major nuisances in homes in the study area in México. Households were found to have taken vigorous action to kill mosquitoes and other insect pests and spent substantial amounts of money on insecticide consumer products.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25040259","annotations":[{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.794512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Insecticide","weight":0.530556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide"},{"name":"Mexican peso","weight":0.490777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_peso"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.364669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Insect","weight":0.355374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Aerosol spray","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol_spray"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.181385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Money","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"},{"name":"Consumer product","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_product"},{"name":"Aerosol","weight":0.0421175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Pest (organism)","weight":0.0242619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"408","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/408"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS in South Africa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Plug-in (computing)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)"},{"name":"Electromagnet","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Canning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"}]}
