{"id":21752,"title":"Acceptability of interferon-gamma release assays among healthcare workers who receive routine employee tuberculosis testing.","abstract":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) undergo annual testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).Compare acceptability of tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) among HCWs.HCWs at four medical centers in the US were administered an acceptability questionnaire including a brief objective description of both tests and eliciting attitudes regarding TST and IGRAs, confidence in results, and likelihood of taking LTBI treatment.Of 406 participants, 75% had never heard of IGRAs. IGRAs were preferred to TST. Belief in accuracy of hypothetical positive results of TST or IGRA and willingness to accept LTBI treatment were similar across tests. When presented with hypothetical discordant results, HCWs expressed more confidence in IGRAs. Perceived accuracy of results was the most important factor in test preferences.Although HCWs preferred and indicated more confidence in IGRAs, the likelihood that HCWs would believe LTBI diagnosis and initiate treatment based on positive results was similar for TST and IGRAs.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588038","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.717234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.238729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_diagnosis"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Employee","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee"},{"name":"Discordant","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordant"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Willingness to accept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingness_to_accept"}]}
