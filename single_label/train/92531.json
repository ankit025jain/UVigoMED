{"id":92531,"title":"Predictors of endothelial dysfunction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","abstract":"We investigated the predictors of endothelial dysfunction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD). The study population included 50 patients with RA and 30 controls. Disease activity score (DAS28) was calculated for patients with RA. An FMD response <7% was accepted as impaired FMD. Brachial artery Doppler study revealed that in patients with RA, FMD% was significantly lower as compared with controls (6.6% ± 3.5% vs 9.7% ± 41%, P = .002). After multivariate logistic regression analysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; OR: 1.086, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.012-1.167, P = .023), duration of RA (OR: 1.392, 95% CI: 1.044-1.856, P = .024), and DAS28 (OR: 3.335, 95% CI: 1.067-10.42, P = .038) were independent predictors of impaired FMD in patients with RA. Endothelial function is impaired in patients with RA. Disease duration, DAS28, and ESR indicating active inflammation are independent predictors of impaired FMD in patients with RA.
