{"id":23153,"title":"[Management of patients with Helicobacter pylori-related illness in the ordinary clinical practice. Intermediate results of monitoring program].","abstract":"In publication presented the interim results of the observation program with aim to evaluate key aspects of use of anti-Helicobacter therapy, including proton pump inhibitors, bismuth, josamycin and amoxicillin in the treatment of H. pylori-associated diseases in routine clinical practice.The program included patients with H. pylori-associated diseases whom quadruple anti-helicobacter therapy was prescribed. Survey plan, instrumental and laboratory tests and monitoring the of treatment determined by physician within the frame of his daily practice. Intervals of three visits were not fixed.In interim results analysis were included 417 patients, mean age was 44 years. For detection of H. pylori invasive methods were used in 65% patients and non-invasive methods were used 47% patients. For confirmation of eradication non-invasive tests were applied more commonly (74%) than invasive (30%). Deviations from the current clinical recommendations in eradication monitoring have been identified in 71%. Overall eradication rate was 89%. Scheme tolerability was evaluated by physicians as good in 84% of patients. Further monitoring the routine management of patients with H. pylori infection is needed.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501953","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Bismuth","weight":0.608823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.535303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.506403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.396406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.214493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.151625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0779046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Josamycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josamycin"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Scheme (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Ordinary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary"},{"name":"Quadruple","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
