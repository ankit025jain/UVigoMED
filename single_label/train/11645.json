{"id":11645,"title":"Pediatric seizure disorders in dogs and cats.","abstract":"Seizure disorders in young animals pose different considerations as to cause and therapeutic decisions compared with adult animals. Infectious diseases of the nervous system are more likely in puppies and kittens compared with adults. The diagnosis of canine distemper is often based on clinical signs. Idiopathic epilepsy typically occurs in dogs between 1 and 5 years of age; however, inflammatory brain diseases such as necrotizing encephalitis and granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis also commonly occur in young to middle-aged small-breed dogs. The choice of which anticonvulsant to administer for maintenance therapy is tailored to each individual patient.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24580991","annotations":[{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.566255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.541068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.496718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.465255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.2576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Canine distemper","weight":0.103079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_distemper"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
