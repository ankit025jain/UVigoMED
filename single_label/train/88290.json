{"id":88290,"title":"Which measure should be used to assess the patient's functional outcome after distal radius fracture?","abstract":"The Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scores appear most frequently in the literature when assessing functional outcome after distal radius fracture. We aimed to evaluate if the two questionnaires correlate. We reviewed 258 cases of adults who sustained a distal radius fracture over a one year period. At mean follow-up of 17 months the disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) and the patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) scores were recorded. The outcome scores for each group were not statistically different (DASH p = 0.86, PRWE p = 0.80). The results of both questionnaires correlated strongly (Spearman's coefficient = 0.90). As the DASH score is potentially influenced by concomitant upper limb problems we suggest that the specific patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) be the sole instrument for assessing the functional outcome of distal radius fractures. This will reduce questionnaire fatigue and standardise the literature.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873095","annotations":[{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.619353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.425805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.36771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.325714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.286132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.233715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.196775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"258","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/258"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
