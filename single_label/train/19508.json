{"id":19508,"title":"Retrospective analysis of 15 cases of Penicilliosis marneffei in a southern China hospital.","abstract":"We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and clinical characteristics of 15 patients diagnosed with Penicilliosis marneffei (PSM) between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2012, at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The most common symptoms of PSM were fever (14/15, 93 %), cough (13/15, 87 %), and sputum production (6/15, 40 %), weight loss (14/15, 60 %), lymph node enlargement (9/15, 60 %), hepatosplenomegaly (7/15, 47 %), anemia (7/15, 47 %), and hemoptysis (4/15, 26 %). The most common underlying diseases in patients diagnosed with PSM were AIDS (9/15, 60 %), post-organ transplantation (3/15, 20 %), rheumatic autoimmune disease (2/15, 13 %), and hematological malignancy (1/15, 7 %). All patients, except those with AIDS, were treated with immunosuppressant drugs. White blood cell counts were increased in 10/15 (67 %) patients, while hemoglobin concentrations were decreased in 8/15 (53 %) patients. The ratios of CD4(+)/total T lymphocytes and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes declined in all the 11 test cases. Nodular lesions or masses were the most common anomalies detected during computed tomography scans, but disseminated inflammation and interstitial changes were also seen. Clinical samples with positive culture results were obtained from sputum or secretions obtained by bronchoscopy, venous blood, percutaneous pulmonary puncture, bone marrow, or skin lesions. Between 1993 and 2003, only four cases of PSM, all connected with AIDS, were diagnosed, while 11 cases of PSM, with or without concurrent AIDS, were diagnosed between 2003 and 2012. Amphotericin B was used to control the disease in some cases. In conclusion, the occurrence of PSM, especially in patients without concurrent AIDS, has increased. The early culture of Penicillium marneffei from clinical samples is critical for correct diagnosis of PSM, and amphotericin B is recommended as the first choice for treatment.
