{"id":66145,"title":"Mentha piperita in nephrotoxicity--a possible intervention to ameliorate renal derangements associated with gentamicin.","abstract":"Free radical generation has a strong role in the pathogenesis of renal damage associated with the use of gentamicin. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the renoprotective effect of Mentha piperita against gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity.A total of 24 male rabbits were divided into 4 groups receiving normal saline, gentamicin, M. piperita extract and co-therapy of extract and gentamicin respectively. Gentamicin was provided as 80 mg/kg/day intramuscularly and extract was given 200 mg/kg/day orally for a period of 21 days. Serum and urinary biochemical parameters and histological changes were studied for each group. The impact of the extract on the antibacterial action of gentamicin was also evaluated.Animals treated with gentamicin showed derangements in serum and urinary biochemical parameters. These alterations were reversed by treatment with M. piperita extract. The histological changes showed in gentamicin group were also reverted by treatment with the extract. Further the plant did not influence the efficacy of gentamicin with respect to its antimicrobial properties.Co-therapy of M. piperita with gentamicin successfully attenuated biochemical kidney functioning derangements and morphological changes associated with gentamicin.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741187","annotations":[{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.847324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.727672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.588959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.588649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mentha","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.302246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.142337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0673439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Peppermint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"}]}
