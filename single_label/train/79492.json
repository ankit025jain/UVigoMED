{"id":79492,"title":"Correlation between subjective and objective results in nasal surgery.","abstract":"There is a lack of medical literature demonstrating a positive correlation between subjective and objective results in functional nasal surgery.The author presents his experience measuring nasal function subjectively and objectively before and after functional nasal surgery.Between March 2011 and June 2012, a total of 119 consecutive patients with nasal obstruction underwent rhinoplasty with a variety of septorhinoplasty techniques. Results were evaluated with a scientifically validated patient questionnaire as well as pre- and postoperative rhinomanometry measurement comparisons. Preoperative and postoperative rhinomanometry measurements were standard protocol, and the rhinomanometry measurements were designed as a prospective study.Ninety of the 119 patients had postoperative rhinomanometry measurements that could be compared with preoperative values, and these patients were included in the study. Statistically significant subjective and objective functional improvements were reported in 98.9% and 95.6% of patients, respectively, while 94.4% of patients had both subjective and objective statistically significant functional improvement. A statistically significant correlation between the subjective and objective improvements was noted.The findings provide statistically significant evidence to support surgical treatment of nasal obstruction.3.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413288","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.344178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.335884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Rhinoplasty","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoplasty"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Origin of birds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_birds"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Empirical validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_validation"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"}]}
