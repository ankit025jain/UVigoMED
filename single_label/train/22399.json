{"id":22399,"title":"Multiple pulmonary nodules caused by Corynebacterium striatum in an immunocompetent patient.","abstract":"Nondiphtherial corynebacteria are ubiquitous in nature and commonly colonize the skin and mucous membranes of humans, however they rarely account for clinical infection. We present the first reported case of multiple pulmonary nodules caused by Corynebacterium striatum. The infection occurred in a 72-year-old immunocompetent female, and the diagnosis was obtained by Gram's stain and culture of lung biopsy. C. striatum should be recognized as a potential pathogen in both immunocompromised and normal hosts in the appropriate circumstances.
