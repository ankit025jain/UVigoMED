The diagnosis of urinothorax was confirmed by demonstrating a pleural fluid to serum creatinine ratio of greater than one. Management of ureteric injury by insertion of Double J (DJ) stents on both sides resulted in resolution of the pleural effusion.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772756","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.533837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.529215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.503435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.429832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Transudate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transudate"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Double (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Disc jockey","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
