{"id":66038,"title":"Proximal tubule toll-like receptor 4 expression linked to inflammation and apoptosis following hypoxia/reoxygenation injury.","abstract":"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a key role in mediating kidney damage during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and its expression is enhanced following renal I/R injury. Our study focused on TLR4 silencing-mediated downstream antiapoptotic pathways during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and investigated whether TLR4 overexpression exacerbates the renal damage induced by I/R injury.Proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs) were isolated and H/R injury mediated by ATP depletion, and replenishment was performed to mimic in vivo I/R injury. PTECs were transfected with either TLR4 siRNA or TLR4-overexpressing vectors to determine the contribution of TLR4 to H/R injury-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response.H/R injury significantly enhanced PTEC apoptosis (p < 0.01) and the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? and interleukin (IL)-8; however, TLR4 silencing significantly reversed these effects (p < 0.05). Moreover, compared to PTECs or PTECs-siCon exposed to H/R injury, overexpression of TLR4 further upregulated TNF-? and IL-8 (p < 0.05), but did not enhance apoptosis. The expression of cytochrome C and caspases 3, 8, and 9 was decreased in the siTLR4 group compared to controls after H/R injury, whereas TLR4 silencing did not alter CHOP expression. TLR4 overexpression failed to promote the expression of cytochrome C and caspases 3, 8, and 9, and reduced the expression of CHOP and GPR78.Knockdown of TLR4 could protect PTECs from H/R injury via inhibiting mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. TLR4 overexpression did not increase PTEC apoptosis induced by H/R injury due in part to the downregulation of CHOP.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751828","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.823615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Cytochrome c","weight":0.770479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.672514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.601022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.480975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.474473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0842719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
