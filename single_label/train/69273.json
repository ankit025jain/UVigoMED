{"id":69273,"title":"Comparison of testicular volume differential calculations in adolescents with varicoceles.","abstract":"We aimed to develop a conversion formula between different calculations for testicular volume asymmetry.Male adolescents with varicoceles who underwent scrotal ultrasound were studied. Two formulas were analyzed: (1) testicular volume differential, TVDiff = (RTV - LTV)/(TTV), and (2) atrophy index, AI = (RTV - LTV)/(RTV). RTV, LTV, and TTV represent the right, left, and total testicular volume. Through transformations and regression a conversion formula between the calculations was derived.Based on 248 ultrasounds, a clear relationship between the two formulas was demonstrated: AI = ln[(1.97 Ã— TVDiff) + 1], (p < 0.0001).Differential testicular volumes can easily be converted from one formula to another with near-perfect accuracy. The formulas are essentially identical and interchangeable.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456820","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.727416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Formula","weight":0.254146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.150375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.11378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Scrotum","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Natural logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Transformation (function)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(function)"},{"name":"Synonym","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Retro Television Network","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Television_Network"},{"name":"Taiwan Television","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Television"}]}
