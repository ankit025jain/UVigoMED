{"id":67459,"title":"Defining prostate cancer risk after radical prostatectomy.","abstract":"Prostate cancer encompasses a wide spectrum of tumor phenotypes with differing prognoses and a part of these patients are at risk of experiencing tumor recurrence after initial treatment. This review discusses the parameters that determine PCa risk for failure after radical prostatectomy and also focuses on the ability of currently available post-treatment nomograms to predict treatment outcomes, and probability of treatment failure. The use of predictive nomograms may be therefore helpful in the complex decision making process.
