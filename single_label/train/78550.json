{"id":78550,"title":"Increased association between febrile convulsion and allergic rhinitis in children: a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study.","abstract":"Febrile convulsions and allergic rhinitis are both common childhood disorders and both are considered as generally benign disorders. Yet, especially in the case of allergic rhinitis, adverse effects on school performance and limited socialization are found. The relationship between febrile convulsions and allergic rhinitis has not been previously reported; thus, this article seeks to explore the association between these two disorders by collecting data from the Taiwanese nationwide cohort database.A total of 1304 children with febrile convulsions were identified as the case cohort, and controls were matched based on age, sex, urbanization levels, and parents' occupation on a 1 to 4 ratio. Cox's proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio and confidence interval of allergic rhinitis disorder among children with febrile convulsions.During an average 6.7 years follow-up period, the incidence of allergic rhinitis in the febrile convulsions case group was higher (65.16 vs 51.45 per 1000 person-years). After 11 years of follow-up, the allergic rhinitis incidence in the febrile convulsion patients was approximate 4% higher than controls (log-rank test P < 0.0001). Risk of allergic rhinitis in the febrile convulsions group was found to be 1.21 times higher than in the control group (95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.36). This risk of allergic rhinitis development is further increased (0.94 vs 18.9) with frequency of febrile convulsions-related medical visits (one to three visits vs more than three visits, P < 0.0001).Febrile convulsions may be associated with allergic rhinitis occurrence in children. Children with more than three febrile convulsion-related medical visits had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of allergic rhinitis. Both disorders have previously been reported to have similar cytokine profiles and specific viral infection association. More studies are required to explore a possible link between the two disorders.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630280","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.790876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.704693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.654842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Convulsion","weight":0.591611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsion"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Febrile seizure","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_seizure"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.424734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.242983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0548502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Urbanization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Socialization","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization"}]}
