{"id":88878,"title":"Fixation of delayed union or non-union posterior cruciate ligament avulsion fractures.","abstract":"To report the outcome of fixation for delayed union or non-union posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fractures.Seven men and 4 women aged 24 to 35 (mean, 28) years underwent lag screw or suture fixation for non-union or delayed union of avulsion fracture of PCL tibial attachment after a mean delay of 8.6 (range, 4-14) months. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Functional outcome was evaluated using the Lysholm scale.The mean follow-up period was 17 (range, 8-36) months. The mean Lysholm score improved from 82 preoperatively to 92 at the final follow-up (p=0.34), the mean range of knee motion improved from 82ยบ to 87ยบ (p=0.008), and the mean VAS score for patient satisfaction improved from 4.3 to 7.4 (p=0.0004). All patients but one achieved bone union after a mean of 7.5 (range, 7-9) weeks. Functional outcome was excellent for 6 patients, good for 4, and fair for one. Posterior drawer test was positive (grade I laxity) in 3 patients whose outcome was good for 2 and fair for one. The latter had non-union after Ethibond suture repair for a communited fracture. There were no instances of wound complications or implant loosening.Fixation with lag screw or suture combined with bone grafting for delayed union or non-union of PCL avulsion fractures achieves acceptable functional outcome.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781618","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.732289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.620243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.590595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Avulsion fracture","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_fracture"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.121984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Posterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0250317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"414","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/414"},{"name":"836","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/836"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Lag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Drawer test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawer_test"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Drawer (furniture)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawer_(furniture)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"}]}
