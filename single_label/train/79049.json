{"id":79049,"title":"Statistical study on the incidence of allergic diseases treated with desloratadine and levocetirizine at \"Atopia\" Allergology Medical Center, Ia?i, Romania.","abstract":"Allergies and allergic manifestations are a major health problem in our country and around the world. Epidemiological data have reported an increased incidence of allergic diseases up to 10-30% over the past decades.To evaluate the incidence of the most common allergic diseases treated with desloratadine or levocetirizine, second-generation antihistamines.For diagnosis and assessment of treatment with the two antihistamines the following tests were performed: allergy skin testing, immunoglobulin E blood levels, evaluation of target organ for allergic reaction (lung function tests, nasal and conjunctival examination, assessment of bronchial inflammation).We conducted a retrospective study that included 365 patients (64% women and 36% men) diagnosed with different types of allergy in the \"Atopia\" Allergology Medical Center at Ia?i during the interval August 2012-August 2013. Patients were aged 2 to 90 years (mean age group 35.98 years; 39.55 years for women, and 29.74 years for men).The majority of patients were from urban areas (82%). The most common allergic diseases in the study group were: urticaria (21%), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (14%), allergic bronchitis (14%) and allergic asthma (12%).","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502085","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.840208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.823007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.815539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Bronchitis","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Histamine antagonist","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_antagonist"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.733822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.645783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.506431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.414229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.359623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Allergic conjunctivitis","weight":0.163187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Levocetirizine","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levocetirizine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Desloratadine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desloratadine"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
