{"id":85667,"title":"Athletic altitude training protocols and their application in preparation for mountainous operations.","abstract":"In recent years, small scale counter-insurgency and expeditionary operations have frequently taken place in mountainous, high-altitude areas. Preparation of soldiers for these environments has typically focussed on extended stays at altitude to ensure physiological acclimatisation. However, with the likelihood that future UK deployments may be unpredictable and thus with little time for preparation, is there a means by which the same acclimatisation may be achieved? The field of athletics has been researching such adaptations since the rise of the elite North African long-distance runners in the 1960s. These athletes all lived high above sea level and had become accustomed to performing in the relatively hypoxic environment found at high altitudes. The research has focussed on eliciting physiological acclimatisation in as short a time as possible, while maintaining the ability to train at the correct intensity. In the following review of altitude training we highlight areas for future investigation and assess whether protocols developed for athletes can be applied to military personnel.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881430","annotations":[{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.559514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.441137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Sea level","weight":0.422766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Above mean sea level","weight":0.234341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.162983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.15594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.139894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Athletics (sport)","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_(sport)"},{"name":"1960s","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s"},{"name":"Sea","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Train","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train"},{"name":"North Africa","weight":0.0333333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa"},{"name":"Running","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Counter-insurgency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-insurgency"},{"name":"Elite","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"},{"name":"Acclimatization","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"1960","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960"},{"name":"Thermosphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Expeditionary warfare","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expeditionary_warfare"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Altitude training","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_training"}]}
