{"id":37239,"title":"Characterization of transcription factor AP-2 ? mutations involved in familial isolated patent ductus arteriosus suggests haploinsufficiency.","abstract":"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is one of the most common congenital heart defects. Transcription factor AP-2 beta (TFAP2B) mutations are associated with the Char syndrome, a disorder associated with PDA, and with facial and fingers abnormalities. Recently, we identified two TFAP2B mutations in two families without Char syndrome phenotype, c.601+5G>A and c.435_438delCCGG, and these TFAP2B mutations were associated with familial isolated PDA. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of these mutations on TFAP2B function.Plasmids containing the wild-type or mutated TFAP2B were constructed and transfected in cells. Plasmids containing the TFAP2B coactivator, Cpb/p300-interacting transactivator 2 (CITED2), was also transfected. TFAP2B expression was detected by luciferase expression and by Western blot analysis.These mutations resulted in loss of transactivation function, which could not be improved by Cpb/p300-interacting transactivator 2. The c.601+5G>A mutated gene did not express any protein, whereas the c.435_438delCCGG mutation did not impact the transactivation function activated by the wild-type TFAP2B.These results suggest that a haploinsufficiency effect of TFAP2B could be involved in familial isolated PDA.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507797","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Haploinsufficiency","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haploinsufficiency"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.717586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Coactivator (genetics)","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coactivator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.488503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.453327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.334454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Transactivation","weight":0.288198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactivation"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Patent ductus arteriosus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Tea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
