{"id":11253,"title":"Egr1 mediated the neuronal differentiation induced by extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields.","abstract":"There is a specific frequency of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) that promotes neuronal differentiation. Although several mechanisms are known to regulate ELF-EMF-induced neuronal differentiation, a key factor that mediates neurogenic potentials by the ELF-EMF is largely unknown. Also, the potential use of ELF-EMF exposure in cell transplantation assays is yet to be determined, including their possible use in ELF-EMF based therapy of neurological diseases. The aim of this study is to understand the underlying mechanisms that mediate ELF-EMF-induced neuronal differentiation and also to harness these mechanisms for cell transplantation assays.Human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) were exposed to ELF-EMF (50 Hz frequency, 1mT intensity) for 8 days. The hBM-MSC derived neurons were then analyzed by general molecular biology techniques including immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. To assess changes in gene expression induced by ELF-EMF exposure, we analyzed the transcriptome of neuronal cells after an 8-day ELF-EMF exposure (50 Hz, 1 mT) and compared the transcriptional profiles to control cells.We found that early growth response protein 1 (Egr1) is one of the key transcription factors in ELF-EMF-induced neuronal differentiation. In addition, we show that transplantations of ELF-EMF-induced neurons significantly alleviate symptoms in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease.These findings indicate that a specific transcriptional factor, Egr1, mediates ELF-EMF-induced neuronal differentiations, and demonstrate the promise of ELF-EMF based cell replacement therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603130","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.924931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.864258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.630919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"EGR1","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGR1"},{"name":"Electromagnetic field","weight":0.264178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.241231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Electromagnetic radiation","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"},{"name":"Tesla (unit)","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
