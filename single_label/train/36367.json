{"id":36367,"title":"Prevalence of Prader-Willi syndrome among infants with hypotonia.","abstract":"To investigate the prevalence of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in infants with hypotonia between the ages of 0 and 2 years.Karyotyping studies were performed in all infants with hypotonia. The study group was composed of infants with hypotonia for whom the karyotyping was found to be normal. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and methylation analysis were performed simultaneously in the study group. Molecular studies for uniparental disomy were undertaken in the patients without deletions with an abnormal methylation pattern.Sixty-five infants with hypotonia with a mean age of 8 months were enrolled. A deletion was detected in 6 patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Only 1 patient had no deletion but had an abnormal methylation pattern. A maternal uniparental disomy was observed in this patient. PWS was diagnosed in 10.7 % (7/65) of the infants with hypotonia.The prevalence of PWS syndrome is high among infants with hypotonia. PWS should be considered by pediatricians and neonatologists in the differential diagnosis of all newborns with hypotonia. Early diagnosis of PWS is important for the management of these patients.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582009","annotations":[{"name":"Hypotonia","weight":0.895066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Uniparental disomy","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniparental_disomy"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.826211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.614078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.567912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.476844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.448994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.422117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.402348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.290105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Neonatology","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"765","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/765"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"PWS (aircraft manufacturer)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWS_(aircraft_manufacturer)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mother","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother"}]}
