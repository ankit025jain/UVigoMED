{"id":54804,"title":"Tear menisci after laser in situ keratomileusis with mechanical microkeratome and femtosecond laser.","abstract":"To investigate the effect on tear menisci after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) with flap creation by either microkeratome or femtosecond laser.Sixty eyes of 30 myopes were analyzed. Fifteen patients underwent LASIK with Moria II microkeratome, and the other 15 patients with 60-KHz IntraLase femtosecond laser. Upper and lower tear meniscus parameters of height (UTMH, LTMH) and area (UTMA, LTMA) were measured by SD-OCT preoperatively and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively.Compared with the baseline values, all tear meniscus parameters decreased significantly at each postoperative time point (all P < 0.01) in both groups. LTMH increased significantly between 1 week and 1 month and between 1 and 3 months after surgery in the microkeratome (both P < 0.01) and femtosecond laser groups (P < 0.01, P = 0.012, respectively). There were significant increases in LTMA between 1 week and 1 month after surgery in the microkeratome group (P < 0.01) and in the femtosecond laser group (P = 0.028). There were no significant differences in UTMH, UTMA, LTMH, or LTMA between two groups. The depth of ablation was negatively correlated with the LTMA at 1 week after surgery (R = -0.256, P = 0.049) for all patients.There were no significant differences in the tear meniscus parameters between the microkeratome and femtosecond laser groups. The depth of ablation was significantly correlated with the LTMA only at 1 week after surgery.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146992","annotations":[{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.523877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.414997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.374681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.323844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Microkeratome","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkeratome"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.182231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.0602563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0599054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Meniscus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus"},{"name":"Moria (Middle-earth)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)"},{"name":"IntraLase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntraLase"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0283361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
