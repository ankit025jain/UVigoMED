{"id":43322,"title":"Inhibition of 11?-HSD1 with RO5093151 for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing worldwide and an effective and safe pharmacological treatment is needed. We investigated whether inhibition of 11?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11?-HSD1, also known as HSD11B1) by RO5093151 could safely and effectively decrease liver-fat content in patients with this disorder.We did this trial between Jan 13, 2011, and March 28, 2012. 41 patients were randomly assigned to RO5093151 and 41 to placebo. 35 patients in the RO5093151 group and 39 in the placebo group were included in the efficacy analysis. Mean liver-fat content decreased in the RO5093151 group (from 16·75% [SD 8·67] to 14·28% [8·89]), but not in the placebo group (from 18·53% [10·00] to 18·46% [10·78], p=0·02 for between group difference). 26 participants (65%) in the RO5093151 group had adverse events, compared with 21 (53%) in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (12 patients [30%] in the RO5093151 group vs seven [18%] in the placebo group), and infections and infestations (eight [20%] vs nine [23%]). Nervous system disorders occurred in significantly more patients in the RO5093151 group than in the placebo group (nine [23%] vs two [5%]; p=0·02); all other differences in adverse events were non-significant. One participant (3%) in the placebo group and three participants (8%) in the RO5093151 group had serious adverse events. All serious adverse events were deemed unrelated to study treatment.Inhibition of 11?-HSD1 by RO5093151 was effective and safe in reducing liver-fat content, suggesting that targeting of 11?-HSD1 might be a promising approach for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.F Hoffmann-La Roche.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System
