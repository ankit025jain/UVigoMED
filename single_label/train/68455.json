{"id":68455,"title":"Down-regulation of UNC5D in bladder cancer: UNC5D as a possible mediator of cisplatin induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells.","abstract":"Identifying potential targets would improve therapeutic planning andÂ disease management. Therefore, we investigated whether the novel identified dependence receptor UNC5D acts as a tumor suppressor in bladder malignancies.We assessed the UNC5D level in a panel of 15 primary bladder carcinomas and 6 cell lines using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. MTT assay, TUNEL staining, colony formation assay and Western blot were done in cells untransfected and transfected with UNC5D vector, siUNC5D or siDAPK.UNC5D was dramatically down-regulated in bladder cancer tissue samples and malignant cell lines. Restoration of UNC5D expression in bladder cancer cells lacking endogenous UNC5D expression suppressed cell proliferation and survival. Cisplatin treatment significantly induced UNC5D expression and DAPK dephosphorylation while UNC5D knockdown decreased bladder cancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin. DAPK silencing significantly inhibited the effect of UNC5D on apoptosis induced by cisplatin.Our study suggests that UNC5D may have important roles as a novel suppressor in bladder cancer via the UNC5D/DAPK pathway.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518784","annotations":[{"name":"Western
