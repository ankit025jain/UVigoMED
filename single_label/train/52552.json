{"id":52552,"title":"Impact of molecular testing in the diagnosis of thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology: data from mainland China.","abstract":"The molecular work-up of thyroid nodules from fine needle aspiration samples has given clinicians a new level of diagnostic information. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the utility of molecular analysis in thyroid fine needle aspiration samples from a Chinese population.Specimens were collected from thyroid nodules by fine needle aspiration. Cytology diagnosis and genes analysis were performed and correlated with histology outcome.A total of 83 patients with thyroid nodules were enrolled, including 20 benign lesions and 63 papillary carcinomas. BRAF and RAS mutations and RET/PTC gene rearrangements were found in 65.1%, 0%, and 1.6% of papillary carcinomas, respectively. No gene alterations were found in benign lesions. The combination of BRAF testing and cytology improved the accuracy of cytology from 69.9% to 89.2% (P < 0.05). Moreover, BRAF testing confirmed 82.4% of papillary carcinomas with suspicious cytology and identified 33.3% of papillary carcinomas with atypia cytology.Of the three candidate markers, BRAF testing showed diagnostic utility in fine needle aspiration. Combining BRAF testing with cytology improves the accuracy of fine needle biopsy. Those who have positive BRAF and malignant or suspicious malignant cytology can undergo thyroidectomy without a frozen section.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591770","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.697946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Frozen section procedure","weight":0.686339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_section_procedure"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.681038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.613936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.56659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.463218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.423671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.357073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.356946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.312859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"China","weight":0.243284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Atypia","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypia"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
