{"id":42286,"title":"Hybrid capture II and PapilloCheck® tests for detection of anal high-risk human papillomavirus.","abstract":"This study evaluated the level of concordance between hybrid capture II (HCII) and PapilloCheck® for the detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) in anal samples.Anal cell samples collected from 42 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+ patients were analyzed.Considering only the 13 high-risk HPV types that are detectable by both tests, HCII was positive for 52.3% of the samples, and PapilloCheck® was positive for 52.3%. The level of concordance was 80.9% (Kappa = 0.61).Good concordance was observed between the tests for the detection of high-risk HPV.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861299","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.607362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.444457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.437968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.397839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.0989523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_Human_Computer_Interaction_Institute"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
