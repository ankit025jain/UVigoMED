{"id":52336,"title":"A Japanese family with nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism caused by a novel heterozygous thyrotropin receptor gene mutation.","abstract":"Hyperthyroidism caused by activating mutations of the thyrotropin receptor gene (TSHR) is rare in the pediatric population.We found a Japanese family with hyperthyroidism without autoantibody. DNA sequence analysis of TSHR was undertaken in this family. The functional consequences for the Gs-adenylyl cyclase and Gq/11-phospholipase C signaling pathways and cell surface expression of receptors were determined in vitro using transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells.We identified a heterozygous mutation (M453R) in exon 10 of TSHR. In this family, this mutation was found in all individuals who exhibited hyperthyroidism. The results showed that this mutation resulted in constitutive activation of the Gs-adenylyl cyclase system. However, this mutation also caused a reduction in the activation capacity of the Gq/11-phospholipase C pathway, compared with the wild type.We demonstrate that the M453R mutation is the cause of nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608569","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.824296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Phospholipase C","weight":0.806404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_C"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.773419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.630268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.538047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.525547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.513682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.485739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.0989124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.0732274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.0633088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Thyrotropin receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyrotropin_receptor"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Geomorphology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphology"},{"name":"Japanese people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
