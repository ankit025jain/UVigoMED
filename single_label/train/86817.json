{"id":86817,"title":"[Adaptive evolution of the hemagglutinin genes of the H6N1 avian influenza virus in Taiwan, China].","abstract":"In Taiwan, the first human-infecting H6N1 avian influenza virus was isolated in 2013. To better understand the origin, evolutionary relationship and pathogenesis of the H6N1 virus, we studied the adaptive evolution and evolutionary dynamics of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of the H6N1 virus in Taiwan. We felt that such studies woud contribute to the further study and control of the virus. Datasets were gained from the Flu and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) databases. Then, phylogenetic trees and evolutionary dynamics were reconstructed. The evolutionary rate and characterization of adaptive evolution were analyzed by bioinformatic methods. Results indicated that the HA genes of H6N1 in Taiwan were divided into at least five types, and that the new types that the infected human H6N1 belonged to could be local advantage type at present. Evolutionary dynamics revealed the viral population expanded first at the end of 1971, reduced sharply in 2008, and then increased slightly. Three sites were identified under positive selection, suggesting that various sites might increase the adaptive ability of the virus. Eighty-nine sites were under negative selection, revealing that these sites might play an important role in the replication and epidemiology of the virus. Interestingly, site 329 upstream from the cleavage site was also under negative selection, suggesting that this site might be associated with the virulence of H6N1. These data suggest that the HA genes of the Taiwanese H6N1 virus have been undergoing adaptive evolution, and that an outbreak may occur again. Hence, more attention should be paid to the identified sites, to enable timely monitoring and control of a future epidemic.","date":"2015-01-07","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562962","annotations":[{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.905122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"China","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.796634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.760555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.692303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.573353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Phylogenetic tree","weight":0.534747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.277756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Directional selection","weight":0.26768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_selection"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.115541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Negative selection (natural selection)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_selection_(natural_selection)"},{"name":"Evolutionary dynamics","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_dynamics"},{"name":"1971","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
