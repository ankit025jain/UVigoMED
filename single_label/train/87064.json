{"id":87064,"title":"Lymph node stromal cells negatively regulate antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses.","abstract":"Lymph node (LN) stromal cells (LNSCs) form the functional structure of LNs and play an important role in lymphocyte survival and the maintenance of immune tolerance. Despite their broad spectrum of function, little is known about LNSC responses during microbial infection. In this study, we demonstrate that LNSC subsets display distinct kinetics following vaccinia virus infection. In particular, compared with the expansion of other LNSC subsets and the total LN cell population, the expansion of fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) was delayed and sustained by noncirculating progenitor cells. Notably, newly generated FRCs were preferentially located in perivascular areas. Viral clearance in reactive LNs preceded the onset of FRC expansion, raising the possibility that viral infection in LNs may have a negative impact on the differentiation of FRCs. We also found that MHC class II expression was upregulated in all LNSC subsets until day 10 postinfection. Genetic ablation of radioresistant stromal cell-mediated Ag presentation resulted in slower contraction of Ag-specific CD4(+) T cells. We propose that activated LNSCs acquire enhanced Ag-presentation capacity, serving as an extrinsic brake system for CD4(+) T cell responses. Disrupted function and homeostasis of LNSCs may contribute to immune deregulation in the context of chronic viral infection, autoimmunity, and graft-versus-host disease.
