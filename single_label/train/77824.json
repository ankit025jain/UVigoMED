{"id":77824,"title":"[Study on rules of acupoints selection for vertigo in ancient acupuncture].","abstract":"The characteristics of selection and matching acupoint and application rules of meridians in ancient acupuncture literature for vertigo were explored. The data were collected from literature regarding acupuncture for vertigo from the pre-Qin period to Qing dynasty and then database was established. Frequency statistics method and comparison of support degree were applied to analyze and explore application rules of acupoints and meridians, while association rules in data mining was used to extract combinations of acupoints. As a result, for treatment of vertigo, according to frequency of use and support degree, generally the most selected acupoints, in turn, were Fengchi (GB 20), Shangxing (GV 23), Yanggu (SI 5), Jiexi (ST 41), Zulinqi (GB 41) and Shenting (GV 24), etc.; the most methods for matching acupoint were combination of adjacent acupoints, combination of same-meridian acupoints, combination of the superior-inferior acupoints, combination of yang-meridian and yang-meridian acupoints and combination of child-mother meridians acupoints; the most selected meridians were bladder meridian of foot-taiyang, gallbladder meridian of foot-shaoyang and governor vessel. Compared between the ancient and modern literature, it was found out that the ancient and modern clinic has same points in selection of acupoint-meridian and matching acupoints methods. However, the use of Yanggu (SI 5), Jiexi (ST 41) and Feiyang (BL 58) as well as combination of child-mother meridians acupoints were less seen in modern clinic, which could provide new reference.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946637","annotations":[{"name":"Qing Dynasty","weight":0.532155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty"},{"name":"Meridian (geography)","weight":0.486454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.442819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Ancient history","weight":0.405357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Dynasty","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty"},{"name":"Data mining","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Modernism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Matching (graph theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Great Britain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain"},{"name":"British Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Association rule learning","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning"},{"name":"Governor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
