{"id":29774,"title":"Awareness of pre-alcoholic status and changes in such awareness: analysis of narratives by male Japanese patients and their families.","abstract":"In this study, we investigated the extent of awareness on the part of alcoholic people with regard to their alcoholism and changes in such awareness over time. We conducted qualitative, descriptive analysis of data obtained during semistructured interviews of alcoholic people and family members with whom they lived during the pre-alcoholic stage. The awareness of pre-alcoholic people was found to involve seven elements and to undergo changes at three stages of alcohol consumption (when enjoying the effects of alcohol, when escaping from a reality difficult to face directly, and when alcohol began to cause health problems). The results suggest that professional support for pre-alcoholic people should be tailored to the stage of alcohol use of each individual case and should include advice on appropriate alcohol consumption. In addition, identification and follow-up of problematic drinkers and short-term intervention are required.
