{"id":35705,"title":"A novel two-nucleotide deletion in the ATP7A gene associated with delayed infantile onset of Menkes disease.","abstract":"Determining the relationship between clinical phenotype and genotype in genetic diseases is important in clinical practice. In general, frameshift mutations are expected to produce premature termination codons, leading to production of mutant transcripts destined for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay. In X-linked recessive diseases, male patients with frameshift mutations typically have a severe or even lethal phenotype.We report a case of a 17-month-old boy with Menkes disease (NIM #309400), an X-linked recessive copper metabolism disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7A copper transporter gene. He exhibited an unexpectedly late onset and experienced milder symptoms.His genomic DNA showed a de novo two-nucleotide deletion in exon 4 of ATP7A, predicting a translational frameshift and premature stop codon, and a classic severe phenotype. Characterization of his ATP7A mRNA showed no abnormal splicing.We speculate that translation reinitiation could occur downstream to the premature termination codon and produce a partially functional ATP7A protein. Study of the child's fibroblasts found no evidence of translation reinitiation; however, the possibility remains that this phenomenon occurred in neural tissues and influenced the clinical phenotype.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
