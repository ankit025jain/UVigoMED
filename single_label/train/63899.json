{"id":63899,"title":"Heterogeneity of mesenchymal stromal cells in lymphoproliferative disorders.","abstract":"Accumulating evidence indicates that bone marrow microenvironment plays an important role in the pathogenesis of some myeloid and lymphoid hematological malignancies (HM). Among different environmental associated parameters, those related to functional, cytogenetic and immunological integrity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are particularly relevant. Functional alterations and immunophenotypic abnormalities have been described in MSC obtained from HM patients. These data seem to confirm the defective biological pattern of MSC especially in myeloid diseases, while MSC cytogenetic profile in HM is still an open question, because it is not clear whether BM stromal cells are \"culprit or bystander\" displaying or not an abnormal karyotype. Contradictory findings were reported in different HM but the functional implications of altered MSC karyotype need to be further addressed also in light of a clinical use of MSC. A \"pathological\" in vivo supportive function of endogenous MSC, which provide important survival and drug resistance signals to leukemic cells especially in lymphoproliferative disorders, is suggested. Thus, the mechanisms underlying these protective versus cytotoxic effects exerted by MSC on leukemic cells need further investigations.
