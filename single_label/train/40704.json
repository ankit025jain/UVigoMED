{"id":40704,"title":"Common variants in the HLA-DQ region confer susceptibility to idiopathic achalasia.","abstract":"Idiopathic achalasia is characterized by a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax due to a loss of neurons in the myenteric plexus. This ultimately leads to massive dilatation and an irreversibly impaired megaesophagus. We performed a genetic association study in 1,068 achalasia cases and 4,242 controls and fine-mapped a strong MHC association signal by imputing classical HLA haplotypes and amino acid polymorphisms. An eight-residue insertion at position 227-234 in the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DQ?1 (encoded by HLA-DQB1*05:03 and HLA-DQB1*06:01) confers the strongest risk for achalasia (P=1.73×10(-19)). In addition, two amino acid substitutions in the extracellular domain of HLA-DQ?1 at position 41 (lysine encoded by HLA-DQA1*01:03; P=5.60×10(-10)) and of HLA-DQ?1 at position 45 (glutamic acid encoded by HLA-DQB1*03:01 and HLA-DQB1*03:04; P=1.20×10(-9)) independently confer achalasia risk. Our study implies that immune-mediated processes are involved in the pathophysiology of achalasia.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997987","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.818483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.696741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.624102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.534631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.350458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.272369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.235411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.191487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Achalasia","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achalasia"},{"name":"Megaesophagus","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaesophagus"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Auerbach's plexus","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auerbach's_plexus"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plexus"},{"name":"Common (entertainer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Irreversible process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process"},{"name":"Imputation (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Insertion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"P5 (microarchitecture)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5_(microarchitecture)"}]}
