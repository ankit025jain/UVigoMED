{"id":4614,"title":"Lung segmentation from CT with severe pathologies using anatomical constraints.","abstract":"The diversity in appearance of diseased lung tissue makes automatic segmentation of lungs from CT with severe pathologies challenging. To overcome this challenge, we rely on contextual constraints from neighboring anatomies to detect and segment lung tissue across a variety of pathologies. We propose an algorithm that combines statistical learning with these anatomical constraints to seek a segmentation of the lung consistent with adjacent structures, such as the heart, liver, spleen, and ribs. We demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the number of failed detections and increases the accuracy of the segmentation on unseen test cases with severe pathologies.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333193","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.696195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.624192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.436741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.363838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.269341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.246439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Machine learning","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.125893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Automaton","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Unseen character","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unseen_character"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
