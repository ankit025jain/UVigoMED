{"id":85692,"title":"Utility of electrocardiogram in the assessment and monitoring of pulmonary hypertension (idiopathic or secondary to pulmonary developmental abnormalities) in patients?18 years of age.","abstract":"Electrocardiograms have utility in disease stratification and monitoring in adult pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We examined the electrocardiographic findings that are common in pediatric PAH and assessed for correlation with disease severity and progression. We retrospectively identified patients aged?18 years followed at a single institution from January 2001 to June 2012 with catheterization-confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic PAH and PAH secondary to pulmonary developmental abnormalities. Patients with an electrocardiography performed within 60 days of catheterization were included. Primary and secondary outcomes are the prevalence of abnormal electrocardiographic findings at the time of catheterization and the association between electrocardiographic and hemodynamic findings and electrocardiographic changes with disease progression on follow-up catheterization, respectively. Of the 100 electrocardiography-catheterization pairs derived from the 46 patients identified, 93% had an electrocardiographic abnormality: 78% had right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and 52% had right axis deviation (RAD) for age. In patients with idiopathic PAH, the presence of RVH and RAD correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient. RAD and RVH on baseline electrocardiogram was associated with an increased risk of disease progression on subsequent catheterization (odds ratio 11.0, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 96.2, p=0.03) after adjusting for PAH subgroup. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of RAD and RVH on baseline electrocardiogram for disease progression were 92%, 48%, 33%, and 95%, respectively. In conclusion, electrocardiographic abnormalities are common in pediatric PAH. RAD and RVH on electrocardiogram were associated with worse hemodynamics, whereas their absence is suggestive of a lack of disease progression.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878129","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Right ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.669152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.666829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.663236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.632099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.598868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.452547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Vascular resistance","weight":0.451104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_resistance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.420467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.294431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.28687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Congenital abnormality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_abnormality"}]}
