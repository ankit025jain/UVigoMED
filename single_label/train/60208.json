{"id":60208,"title":"[Recommended screening and preventive practices for long-term survivors after hematopoietic cell transplantation].","abstract":"Advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) technology and supportive care techniques have led to improvements in long-term survival after HCT. Emerging indications for transplantation, introduction of newer graft sources (eg, umbilical cord blood) and transplantation of older patients using less intense conditioning regimens have also contributed to an increase in the number of HCT survivors. These survivors are at risk for developing late complications secondary to pre-, peri-, and posttransplantation exposures and risk factors. Guidelines for screening and preventive practices for HCT survivors were published in 2006. An international group of transplantation experts was convened in 2011 to review contemporary literature and update the recommendations while considering the changing practice of transplantation and international applicability of these guidelines. This review provides the updated recommendations for screening and preventive practices for pediatric and adult survivors of autologous and allogeneic HCT.
