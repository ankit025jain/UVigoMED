{"id":45132,"title":"Survival from anal cancer among Hispanics-Puerto Rico, 2000-2007.","abstract":"The incidence of anal cancer is increasing, particularly among HIV and men who have sex with men (MSM) groups. The vast majority of cases are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection. Epidemiological studies have also documented low survival, which might be linked to lack of appropriate screening, access, and utilization of pertinent health care services. Our objective was to assess the relative survival (1 and 3 years) of anal cancer in Puerto Rico for men and women during the period from 2000-2007.All histological types of cancer of anus, anal canal, and anorectum (ICD-O-3 codes C210-C218), except for sarcomas, were included. Relative survival was estimated with the use of life tables from the population of Puerto Rico. In addition, the excess survival was compared by age at diagnosis, histology, and stage (defined as local, regional, or distant), using the Poisson regression model.The overall 3-year relative survival in Puerto Rico was the same (53 %) for men and women.Our findings establish baseline survival data for anal cancer in Hispanics from Puerto Rico. Since now, the national guidelines for anal cancer screening and treatment are on their way to be determined; baseline information about survival will allow monitoring the efficacy that standardized screening programs may eventually have in increasing anal cancer survival in this population.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699986","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Anal cancer","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_cancer"},{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.707499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.675518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Relative survival","weight":0.632035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_survival"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.505099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.502345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Life table","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table"},{"name":"Anal canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_canal"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
