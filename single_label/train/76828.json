{"id":76828,"title":"Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and predictors of vitamin D status in Italian healthy adolescents.","abstract":"Vitamin D plays an important role in health promotion during adolescence. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are common in adolescents worldwide. Few data on vitamin D status and risk factors for hypovitaminosis D in Italian adolescents are currently available.25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were evaluated in 427 Italian healthy adolescents (10.0-21.0 years). We used the following cut-off of 25-OH-D to define vitamin D status: deficiency < 50 nmol/L; insufficiency 50-75 nmol/L; sufficiency ? 75 nmol/L. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as 25-OH-D levels < 75.0 nmol/L and severe vitamin D deficiency as 25-OH-D levels < 25.0 nmol/L. We evaluated gender, residence, season of blood withdrawal, ethnicity, weight status, sun exposure, use of sunscreens, outdoor physical activity, and history of fractures as predictors of vitamin D status.Enrolled adolescents had a median serum 25-OH-D level of 50.0 nmol/L, range 8.1-174.7, with 82.2% having hypovitaminosis D. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were detected in 49.9% and 32.3% of adolescents, respectively. Among those with deficiency, 38 subjects were severely deficient (38/427, 8.9% of the entire sample). Non-white adolescents had a higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency than white subjects (6/17-35.3% vs 32/410-7.8% respectively, p = 0.002). Logistic regression showed increased risk of hypovitaminosis D as follows: blood withdrawal taken in winter-spring (Odds ratio (OR) 5.64) compared to summer-fall period; overweight-obese adolescents (OR 3.89) compared to subjects with normal body mass index (BMI); low sun exposure (OR 5.94) compared to moderate-good exposure and regular use of sunscreens (OR 5.89) compared to non regular use. Adolescents who performed < 3 hours/week of outdoor exercise had higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. Gender, residence, and history of fractures were not associated with vitamin D status. Serum 25-OH-D levels were inversely related to PTH (r =?-0.387, p < 0.0001) and BMI-SDS (r =?-0.141, p = 0.007). 44/427 (10.3%) adolescents showed secondary hyperparathyroidism.Italian adolescents have high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Pediatricians should tackle predictors of vitamin D status, favoring a healthier lifestyle and promoting supplementation in the groups at higher risk of hypovitaminosis D.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902694","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.847232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.696031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.610337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.499746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.483167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.476497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.286088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.151365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.128658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sunscreen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen"},{"name":"Sunburn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
