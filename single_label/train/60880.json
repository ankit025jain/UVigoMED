{"id":60880,"title":"Reduced MIR130A is involved in primary immune thrombocytopenia via targeting TGFB1 and IL18.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the regulation of immunological functions and prevention of autoimmune disease. The abnormal expressions of several miRNAs in patients with the acquired autoimmune disease, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), have been reported. However, the exact mechanism of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of ITP is currently not well understood. This study examined the miRNA expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ITP patients by miRNA array and TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. MIR130A expression was found to be significantly decreased in PBMCs from patients with active chronic ITP compared with that of normal controls. Subsequently, dual-luciferase reporter gene analysis was used to validate that MIR130A targeted the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 18 (IL18) genes. In addition, we also monitored the dynamic expression of MIR130A and its targeted genes pre- and post-treatment of ITP patients and determined that the expression of MIR130A and TGFB1 was up-regulated, whereas IL18 expression was down-regulated after effective treatment. In conclusion, this study suggests that reduced MIR130A is involved in ITP via targeting of TGFB1 and IL18 expression.
