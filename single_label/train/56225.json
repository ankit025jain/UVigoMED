{"id":56225,"title":"Effects of mitomycin-C on tear film, corneal biomechanics, and surface irregularity in mild to moderate myopic surface ablation: preliminary results.","abstract":"To assess the effect of mitomycin-C (MMC) on the tear film, corneal biomechanics, and surface irregularity in surface ablation (photorefractive keratectomy [PRK]) for low to moderate myopia.Refractive Surgery Unit, Farabi Eye Hospital, Tehran, Iran.Double-masked randomized clinical trial.In patients with spherical equivalent myopia of -0.75 to -3.87 diopters (D) and astigmatism up to -1.75 D, the first eye was randomly assigned to the application of MMC 0.02% or a balanced salt solution for 15 seconds. The fellow eye received the alternate in a masked fashion after excimer photoablation.The study enrolled 60 patients. In fellow eyes, the changes in the tear-film index were comparable 1 month and 6 months postoperatively. There was no significant difference in changes in total higher-order aberrations, spherical aberration, coma, or Q values (Pentacam HR) between fellow eyes at 1 month and 6 months. There was a trend toward a higher asymmetry index at 1 month; however, a statistically significant drop was observed at 6 months in the MMC group (P<.01). It was hypothesized that stromal remodeling was delayed, but better, in MMC-treated eyes. No haze was recorded at 6 months in either group.Use of MMC in PRK did not appear to contribute significantly to surface irregularity, transient tear-film dysfunction, or biomechanical weakening of the cornea compared with PRK without MMC.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726159","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.900742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.825046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Spherical aberration","weight":0.74505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.734972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.542605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.505872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Astigmatism (eye)","weight":0.392388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(eye)"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.321186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.262707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.0659316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Tehran","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Al-Farabi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Farabi"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Fellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
