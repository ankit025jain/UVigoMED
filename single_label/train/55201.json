{"id":55201,"title":"Management of significant reactivation of old disciform scars in wet age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"Fibrotic disciform scars represent the end-stage of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and ophthalmologists tend not to treat them. However, reactivation can occur resulting in further worsening of patients. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical outcomes of 10 patients with disciform scars from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that have subsequently reactivated.Indocyanine green angiography (ICG) was used to identify the active areas and these \"hot spots\" (HS) that were subsequently treated with focal laser photocoagulation.In 10 out of 11 patients with potential reactivation of an AMD scar, a treatable HS was found on the ICG at the border of the disciform scar. The identified HS was treated with focal laser photocoagulation. Post treatment these areas became inactive. However in 2 cases, reactivation occurred requiring retreatment a few months later.AMD patients who are noted to have disciform scars that are increasing in size and signs of activation such as lipid exudation and subretinal haemorrhage should undergo ICG imaging to look for HS. These patients could benefit from focal laser to stabilize the disease and avoid complications and further peripheral visual loss. It is suspected that these patients may have the polypoidal subtype of AMD.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965122","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.868508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.796716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.775701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.728498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.723581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.548874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.348417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.225228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Indocyanine green","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indocyanine_green"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Icelandic Coast Guard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Coast_Guard"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"}]}
