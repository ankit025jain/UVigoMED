{"id":63306,"title":"Drug targets for cell cycle dysregulators in leukemogenesis: in silico docking studies.","abstract":"Alterations in cell cycle regulating proteins are a key characteristic in neoplastic proliferation of lymphoblast cells in patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The aim of our study was to investigate whether the routinely administered ALL chemotherapeutic agents would be able to bind and inhibit the key deregulated cell cycle proteins such as--Cyclins E1, D1, D3, A1 and Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDK) 2 and 6. We used Schr√∂dinger Glide docking protocol to dock the chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin and Daunorubicin and others which are not very common including Clofarabine, Nelarabine and Flavopiridol, to the crystal structures of these proteins. We observed that the drugs were able to bind and interact with cyclins E1 and A1 and CDKs 2 and 6 while their docking to cyclins D1 and D3 were not successful. This binding proved favorable to interact with the G1/S cell cycle phase proteins that were examined in this study and may lead to the interruption of the growth of leukemic cells. Our observations therefore suggest that these drugs could be explored for use as inhibitors for these cell cycle proteins. Further, we have also highlighted residues which could be important in the designing of pharmacophores against these cell cycle proteins. This is the first report in understanding the mechanism of action of the drugs targeting these cell cycle proteins in leukemia through the visualization of drug-target binding and molecular docking using computational methods.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24454966","annotations":[{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.916429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"X-ray crystallography","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.827622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.737384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.728216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.705736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.665327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Daunorubicin","weight":0.625776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daunorubicin"},{"name":"Cyclin-dependent kinase","weight":0.610813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.601505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.492399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Docking (molecular)","weight":0.432437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.359201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.322175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nelarabine","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelarabine"},{"name":"Clofarabine","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clofarabine"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Pharmacophore","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacophore"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Computational chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Rumex","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumex"}]}
