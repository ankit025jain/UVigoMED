{"id":67978,"title":"Quality of life of infertile Tunisian couples and differences according to gender.","abstract":"To compare quality-of-life gender differences within infertile couples from Tunisia and between infertile couples and controls.The present case-control study included 100 couples with primary infertility who, during 2009, underwent assisted reproductive technology at Farhat Hached Hospital in Sousse, Tunisia, and 100 control couples. The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was administered to assess quality of life.Compared with male controls, men in the infertility group had lower scores in the mental dimension (P=0.020), social functioning (P=0.007), and role-emotional (P<0.001) categories of the SF-36. Women in the infertility group had lower mental and physical dimension scores (P<0.001) and lower vitality (P=0.022), social functioning (P<0.001), role-emotional (P<0.001), and mental health (P<0.001) scores than female controls. Within infertile couples, female partners had lower total (P=0.01) and mental dimension (P<0.001) scores than their spouses. Delay of the first consultation was correlated with bodily pain, vitality, and mental health among women in the infertility group.Women in infertile couples had a lower quality of life than their spouses, and infertile couples had a lower quality of life than controls. These findings confirm the need for psychological support for infertile couples.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568955","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.81484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.682631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Tunisia","weight":0.637141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.410944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.381513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.3217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Psychiatric rehabilitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
