{"id":54997,"title":"MiRNA-221 negatively regulated downstream p27Kip1 gene expression involvement in pterygium pathogenesis.","abstract":"MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in tumor development. They regulate target gene expression either by mRNA degradation or by translation repression. Activation of ?-catenin has been linked to pterygium progression. Here, we hypothesize that ?-catenin-associated miRNA, miRNA-221, and downstream p27Kip1 gene expression are correlated with the pathogenesis of pterygium.We collected 120 pterygial and 120 normal conjunctival samples for this study. Immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR were performed to determine ?-catenin protein localization, miR-221, and p27Kip1 gene expression. Pterygium cell line (PECs) cell models were used to confirm the effect of ?-catenin, miR-221, and p27Kip1 gene in the proliferation of pterygium cells.Seventy-two (60.0%) pterygial specimens showed high miR-221 expression levels, which was significantly higher than the control groups (13 of 120, 10.8%, p<0.0001). MiR-221 expression was significantly higher in ?-catenin-nuclear/cytoplasmic-positive groups than in ?-catenin membrane-positive and negative groups (p=0.001). We also found that p27Kip1 gene expression in pterygium was negatively correlated with miR-221 expression (p=0.002). In the clinical association, miR-221 expression was significantly higher in the fleshy and intermediate groups than in the atrophic group (p=0.007). The association of miR-221, p27Kip1 and proliferation of pterygium were also confirmed in the PECs model.Our study demonstrated that activation of ?-catenin in pterygium may interact with miR-221, resulting in p27Kip1 gene downregulation that influences pterygium pathogenesis.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25053875","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.768233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Reverse transcription","weight":0.746651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.648697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.568419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.567928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.545761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.458474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.213149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.127125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"CDKN1B","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN1B"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
