{"id":10983,"title":"Electrophysiological evidence on epileptiform activity enhanced by electrical stimulation of teeth in rats.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effects of electrical stimulation (ES) of tooth on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in rats. Experiment was realized on 24 adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were assigned three groups [stimulation group (SG), penicillin group (PG), and penicillin+stimulation group (PSG)]. In SG, ES was only applied. Ten pulses of electrical current were delivered to the teeth for a duration of 2 milliseconds at 1-second intervals from a stimulator. Currents were applied in the range of 40-240 ?A with 40 ?A steps. Electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings were taken before and after ES. In PG, ECoG recordings were taken before and during the injection of penicillin. In PSG, after epileptiform activity was induced, ES was applied and ECoG recordings were taken as in SG. All the data were analyzed with Student's t test. Applied currents did not cause any epileptiform activity in SG. When the PSG was compared with the PG it was seen that the spike frequency of epileptiform activity increased in a statistically significant way after application of 240 ?A (P < 0Â·05). On the other hand current application caused an increase in the spike amplitude of the PSG compared with the amplitude of the PG, but it was not statistically significant. We concluded that ES of tooth with high current can trigger epileptiform activity in rats. For this reason, further research is required to evaluate the effects of ES of tooth for pulp testing on epileptic human subjects and antiepileptic drug users.
