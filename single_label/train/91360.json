{"id":91360,"title":"Self-estimation or phototest measurement of skin UV sensitivity and its association with people's attitudes towards sun exposure.","abstract":"Fitzpatrick's classification is the most common way of assessing skin UV sensitivity. The study aim was to investigate how self-estimated and actual UV sensitivity, as measured by phototest, are associated with attitudes towards sunbathing and the propensity to increase sun protection, as well as the correlation between self-estimated and actual UV sensitivity.A total of 166 primary healthcare patients filled-out a questionnaire investigating attitudes towards sunbathing and the propensity to increase sun protection. They reported their skin type according to Fitzpatrick, and a UV sensitivity phototest was performed.Self-rated low UV sensitivity (skin type III-VI) was associated with a more positive attitude towards sunbathing and a lower propensity to increase sun protection, compared to high UV sensitivity. The correlation between the two methods was weak.The findings might indicate that individuals with a perceived low but in reality high UV sensitivity do not seek adequate sun protection with regard to skin cancer risk. Furthermore, the poor correlation between self-reported and actual UV sensitivity, measured by phototest, makes the clinical use of Fitzpatrick's classification questionable.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511015","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.496418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.428122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.378353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.37766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.258068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.214447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sun tanning","weight":0.113033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_tanning"},{"name":"Sunburn","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Optimism","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Sunscreen","weight":0.0113497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen"}]}
