{"id":84744,"title":"Sacroiliac joint radiofrequency ablation with a multilesion probe: a case series of 60 patients.","abstract":"This retrospective case series of patients with refractory sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain presents our first 77 SIJ radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedures performed with a multilesion probe. Of these, 16 (20.8%) provided no relief; 55 (71.4%) provided >50% pain relief at 6 weeks; 42 (54.5%, 95% confidence interval, 42.8%-65.8%) provided >50% pain relief at 6 months; and 12 (15.6%) continued to provide >50% pain relief at 1 year. These results compare favorably to those published using other RFA techniques. In conclusion, more than half of our patients with refractory SIJ pain received some pain relief for at least 6 months after RFA.
