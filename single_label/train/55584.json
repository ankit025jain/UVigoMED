{"id":55584,"title":"Detection of antiranibizumab antibodies among patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to detect immune responses induced by intravitreal injection (IVT) of ranibizumab in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in real life conditions.An ELISA protocol from blood samples, following 2 different steps, was used to detect antibodies directed against the variable regions of ranibizumab.Among 91 patients included, 46 received more than 10 IVTs, 36 had received 10 IVTs or fewer, and 9 were treatment naïve. Specific antiranibizumab immunoglobulins G were detected in 14/82 treated patients (17.1%). No immunization was detected among naïve patients. For patients with 10 or fewer previous IVTs, immunization against ranibizumab was detected in 4/36 patients (11.1%) whereas immunization was observed in 10/46 patients (21.7%) with more IVTs (p = 0.20).Immunization against ranibizumab can be detected in 17% of treated patients. Further clinical studies are needed to investigate the relationship between specific immunization to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies and response or resistance to ranibizumab treatments.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854579","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.862755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.746087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.729883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.66819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.574244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.355432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.287548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.216946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Nave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"1482","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1482"},{"name":"1046","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1046"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Real life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Minuscule 436","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_436"}]}
