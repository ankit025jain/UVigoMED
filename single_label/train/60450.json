{"id":60450,"title":"Immunoglobulin G values before treatment are correlated with the responsiveness to initial intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for Kawasaki disease.","abstract":"Low levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) before intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy for Kawasaki disease (KD) have been reported as one of the risk factors for coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs). This risk factor needs to be re-evaluated because the dosage of IVIG has changed from 0.2-0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days to a single high dose of 2 g/kg.We reviewed the clinical records of KD patients admitted to our hospital from January 2001 to August 2011. Patients who were given a single high dose of IVIG within 7 days of illness, and who had blood collected for serum immunoglobulin values before treatment, were selected. The serum immunoglobulin levels and coronary artery diameters measured by echocardiogram were transformed to z-scores.The subjects were 197 KD patients, including 22 IVIG nonresponders and 16 patients with CAAs. Of these, 150 (76%) had a z-score for IgG (IgGz) of ?0. There were no differences in IgGz values between patients with CAAs and those without CAAs. However, nonresponders had higher IgGz values than responders (median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile: -0.26, -0.83 and 0.34 vs. -0.79, -1.40 and -0.03; p = 0.020). Logistic regression analysis showed that the IgGz value was an independent risk factor for resistance to IVIG (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.002-1.849; p = 0.048).Low IgGz values were not a risk factor for CAAs in this study. However, KD patients with relatively high IgGz values before treatment may have an increased risk of resistance to initial IVIG therapy. Â© 2014 S.
