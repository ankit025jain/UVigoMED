{"id":62067,"title":"ATF7IP as a novel PDGFRB fusion partner in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children.","abstract":"We identified ATF7IP as a novel PDGFRB fusion partner in B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and showed that B-ALL with ATF7IP/PDGFRB translocation is included within the genomic lesions of a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like ALL subgroup. Comprehensive analyses of previous repositories of gene expression data sets disclosed that B-ALL cases with high PDGFRB expression level in the context of the Ph-like ALL gene are likely to have a PDGFRB translocation. Thus, it is possible that measurement of the PDGFRB expression level can be utilized as a screening test for the detection of the cryptic PDGFRB translocation, especially within the Ph-like ALL subgroup.
