{"id":19452,"title":"Direct detection of indirect transmission of Streptobacillus moniliformis rat bite fever infection.","abstract":"We describe the evaluation of culture-negative synovial fluid from a 3-year-old boy by PCR and electrospray ionization followed by mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). Our patient developed a diffuse rash and fever with systemic signs and symptoms of sepsis, but four sets of blood cultures obtained prior to initiation of antibiotics were negative. After 1 week of illness, he developed right-knee swelling. Analysis of synovial fluid was consistent with infection, but cultures of specimens obtained following initiation of antimicrobial treatment were negative for growth. PCR/ESI-MS detected Streptobacillus moniliformis in the synovial fluid sample. Our patient completed an appropriate course of antibiotic treatment and remained completely asymptomatic in follow-up evaluation. This unique case suggests that PCR/ESI-MS may be a useful diagnostic tool for direct detection of unusual or unexpected pathogens directly from clinical specimens, particularly when samples have been obtained from patients following initiation of antibiotic therapy.
