{"id":84641,"title":"[Fostering compliance by understanding its mechanisms].","abstract":"In the context of chronic disease, nurses play an essential role in the long-term support of the patient. The therapeutic alliance which they create with the patient enables them to detect the various factors which influence compliance, or on the contrary, the non-compliance of the patient. They work in a context of interdisciplinarity in a collaborative practice in which the patient is a partner. Their interventions aim to support the patient in adopting the right health strategies.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065194","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.782496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.616127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Foster care","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Therapeutic relationship","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_relationship"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"}]}
