{"id":70314,"title":"Complementary exercise and quality of life in patients with breast cancer.","abstract":"This literature review will investigate whether complementary exercise interventions can improve quality of life (QoL) for breast cancer patients at all stages of treatment, receiving a variety of cancer therapies.A systematic literature review of academic primary research will be conducted. All relevant evidence found will be analysed and appraised to answer the research question. The term 'complementary' is defined as 'exercises that are additional to the breast-cancer treatment, and specifically not alternative treatments'. The complementary exercise therapies will consider physical movement in all forms.Themes were derived from four assessment domains of QoL: social, physical, functional and psychological wellbeing. Every study showed improved overall QoL and six of the nine studies reviewed showed improved overall QoL to statistical significance. According to theme, statistically significant improvements were recorded in two out of nine studies for social wellbeing; five out of nine for psychological wellbeing; four out of nine for physical wellbeing; and none out of six for functional wellbeing.Complementary exercise does improve QoL, but the improvement was statistically significant in two-thirds of the research findings. This proportion is not deemed strong enough as evidence to influence future practice, so further research is recommended.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25203850","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.798855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.784194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.513123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.361225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.333015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Freedom of movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement"},{"name":"Primary research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_research"}]}
