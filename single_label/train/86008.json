{"id":86008,"title":"Surgical correction of Lutembacher's syndrome in a patient with severe pulmonary artery hypertension.","abstract":"Lutembacher's syndrome is an uncommon combination of a congenital ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) with acquired mitral stenosis (MS). The incidence of this condition is very rare. The symptoms are dependent upon the size of the ASD, severity of the MS, compliance of the right ventricle and pulmonary artery hypertension. We describe a patient with Lutembacher's syndrome with severe pulmonary hypertension who underwent successful surgical repair.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827112","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.856973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Mitral stenosis","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_stenosis"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.761904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.61704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.479276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Foramen secundum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen_secundum"},{"name":"Primary interatrial foramen","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_interatrial_foramen"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"}]}
