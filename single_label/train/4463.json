{"id":4463,"title":"[Inevitable senile death].","abstract":"Many systems essential to ontogenesis become inappropriate in later life, leading to the ageing of cells and loss of regenerative capacity. Ageing tissues are thus increasingly susceptible to chronic diseases associated with ageing. Upon statistical analysis, the elimination of these diseases would bring about only approximately 15 additional years to the life expectancy. With developing therapies, the making of a precise disease diagnosis upon the eventual death will become increasingly difficult, whereby the term frailty syndrome is utilized.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558626","annotations":[{"name":"Frailty syndrome","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frailty_syndrome"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.602344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Ontogeny","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogeny"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"}]}
