{"id":35428,"title":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug - induced transient reactive papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma.","abstract":"Transient reactive papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (TRPA) is an unusual skin condition characterized by the rapid and transient development of symmetric, edematous white papules with eccrine duct prominence on the palms after exposure to water. We present the case of a 28-year-old woman diagnosed in our clinic with TRPA induced by the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The possible pathophysiology and treatment options are discussed.
