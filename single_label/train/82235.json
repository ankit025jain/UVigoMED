{"id":82235,"title":"Orthodontic treatment combined with tooth transplantation for an adult patient with a missing mandibular first molar: long-term follow-up.","abstract":"A Japanese woman, age 29 years 8 months, had a missing mandibular left first molar, bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion, and crowding. She had a skeletal Class II relationship and a long face with a steep mandible. She had previously undergone root canal treatment for the mandibular right second premolar, and the mandibular left third molar was impacted. The maxillary left first premolar was extracted for autotransplantation to the mandibular left first molar region. After confirmation of a favorable prognosis for the transplanted tooth, the maxillary right first premolar, the mandibular right second premolar, and the impacted mandibular left third molar were extracted for orthodontic treatment. The active orthodontic treatment period was 32 months. The patient returned for follow-up records 12 years 7 months after the active treatment, and her facial profile and occlusion were well maintained. At 13 years 9 months after transplantation, no abnormalities were observed with the transplanted tooth in the radiographic and clinical evaluations.
