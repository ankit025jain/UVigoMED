{"id":20688,"title":"[Large incisional hernias surgery with the use of non-adherent mesh].","abstract":"Large incisional hernias repair is often challenging for surgeons. Despite the many available methods and technological progress, we still miss the gold standard in the treatment of incisional hernias and the results are disappointing. The aim of study was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment of large incisional hernias with the use of non-adherent mesh.This paper presents results from the surgical treatment of large incisional hernias in 34 patients. All procedures were performed with application of non-adherent mesh. Information about patients health was obtained from medical records, interviews and physical examination, and analysis from the follow-up.The most frequent postoperative complication was hematoma (17.6%), wound infection (8.8%) and respiratory failure (8.8%). Seven of the implanted grafts were removed due to complications in postoperative period. In four patients with removed mesh, hernia recurrence was not observed. In all patients with recurrence, wound infection, abscess or respiratory failure during postoperative period obesity was present.Using non-adherent mesh in large incisional hernia repair is an effective method, and often the only possible solution for surgical treatment. During the preoperative period, individual indications and good preparation for the surgery should be included.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645571","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.800688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.798721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.713405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.695378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.468758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.276375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.219357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Hernia repair","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia_repair"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"}]}
