{"id":26623,"title":"[Cardiovascular risk in patients suffering abdominal aorta aneurysm].","abstract":"Frequency of cardiovascular pathology was studied in patients, suffering abdominal aorta aneurysm. For this purpose there was conducted analysis of data, concerning examination of patients, suffering abdominal aorta aneurysm: ECG, echo-CS, USDS, and of the CIM thickness. The signs of the coronary blood circulation disorders were revealed in accordance to ECG data in 67.7%, haemodynamically significant affections of coronary arteries were revealed in 71.5%, in 38.3% patients a pathology of extracranial arteries, needing surgical correction, was revealed. Timely estimation of cardiovascular risk gives possibility to determine the order of performance of operations, what must be the first-resection of aneurysm or elimination of risk of the cardiovascular complications occurrence.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25097996","annotations":[{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.780965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.492859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abdominal aorta","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aorta"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
