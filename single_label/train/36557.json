{"id":36557,"title":"Intravitreal foscarnet for recurring CMV retinitis in a congenitally infected premature infant.","abstract":"A girl born at 32 weeks' gestational age was diagnosed at birth with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection without ocular involvement. On day 19 of life, retinal examination requested for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) identified bilateral CMV retinitis and stage 1 ROP. Treatment of macular threatening CMV infection with intravitreal foscarnet injections and intravenous ganciclovir for 6 weeks led to quiescence of retinitis. Bilateral recurrence of CMV retinitis occurred on day 89 of life, requiring a second course of intravitreal foscarnet injections and intravenous ganciclovir. Both the initial presentation and reactivation of CMV retinitis were identified on examination for ROP and would have gone unrecognized had the infant not met ROP screening criteria. This case demonstrates delayed presentation of CMV retinitis after initial negative retinal examination in a premature infant with congenital infection and concurrent ROP.
