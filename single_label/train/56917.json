{"id":56917,"title":"[The indicators of anti-endotoxin immunity under preeclampsia].","abstract":"The dysregulation of immune mechanisms of control of gestational process results in a number of obstetric complications, including preeclampsia. Nowadays, there is no detailed description of characteristics of anti-endotoxin immune response under this complication. To evaluate the role of anti-endotoxin immunity in development of preeclampsia the determination of levels of LBP, IgG to core-region LPS, IgA, IgM, IgG in blood plasma was made in 134 pregnant women during II-III terms. The main group (74 pregnant women with preeclampsia) was divided on 2 sub-groups: 50 women with mild preeclampsia of and 24 women with severe preeclampsia. In the first sub-group, in 14 women with mild preeclampsia additionally concentration of soluble form of CD14 and BPI was determined. The control group consisted of 60 pregnant women with physiological course of gestation. The study demonstrated increase of level of LBP up to 14%, double increase of titers IgG to core-region LPS in blood plasma of pregnant women with preeclampsia under standard concentrations of IgA, IgM, IgG. It was demonstrated that under mild preeclampsia an increase of sCD14, BPI occurs as compared with standard values. The results of study reflect characteristic alterations of congenital and adaptive components of anti-endotoxin immunity under preeclampsia.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25346990","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.925469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.661557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.40668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.385378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.304085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Cluster of differentiation","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_of_differentiation"},{"name":"British Phonographic Industry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Phonographic_Industry"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Igbo people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
