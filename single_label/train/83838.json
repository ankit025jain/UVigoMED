{"id":83838,"title":"Ninety-day postdischarge outcomes of inpatient elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","abstract":"Little information is available about postdischarge adverse events after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Inpatient and 90-day postdischarge adverse events were identified for Medicare patients discharged in 2009-2010 after undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy on day 0, 1, or 2 of hospitalization at facilities that performed 20 or more laparoscopic cholecystectomies during the study period. A predictive length of stay (LOS) linear regression model was derived and used to identify patients with prolonged LOS (prLOS) whose risk-adjusted LOS exceeded a 3? upper limit on a moving average control chart. Rates of inpatient and 90-day fatal and nonfatal adverse events and interrelationships among different outcomes and alternative outcome measures were explored.Of 89,639 study cases, 0.7% died during their index hospitalization, and 1.3% died within 90 days of discharge. Of live discharges, 8.0% had prLOS, and 42.1% had coded complication. In the 90 days after discharge, 9,416 (10.6%) were readmitted. Patients who were prLOS outliers were more likely to die or be readmitted than nonoutliers (P < .0001; ?(2)).More than 18% of Medicare patients undergoing presumably low-risk elective inpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy died, had a severe inpatient complication, or were readmitted within 90 days of discharge.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239349","annotations":[{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.856791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Control chart","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart"},{"name":"Moving average","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Outlier","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Predictive inference","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"639","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/639"},{"name":"Chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Limit (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Crime statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_statistics"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
