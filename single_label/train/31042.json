{"id":31042,"title":"Oxidative hepatotoxicity effects of monocrotaline and its amelioration by lipoic acid, S-adenosyl methionine and vitamin E.","abstract":"Liver is the major site for several xenobiotics metabolism, and formation of toxic metabolites that may be hepatotoxic, therefore the burden of metabolism and exposure to dangerous chemicals make liver vulnerable to a variety of disorders. Our work aimed to investigate the effects of some antioxidants such as lipoic acid (LA), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and vitamin E in a trail to investigate the possibility of using these substances to relieve and protect liver from exposure to monocrotaline (MCT). Twenty-five mature adult rats were classified into five groups (five rats in each group), control group, MCT-induced hepatic damage, LA+MCT, SAM+MCT and vitamin E+MCT group. Homogenates of liver samples were used for measuring the oxidative biomarkers and hepatic antioxidant status. The results showed that administration of vitamin E, SAM and LA caused a significant increase in liver glutathione contents, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase activities and a significant decrease in hepatic catalase and superoxide dismutase. We could conclude that administration of natural LA, SAM and vitamin E before and after MCT injection modulate the hepatic oxidative stresses induced by MCT in various extents.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413220","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.905912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Xenobiotic","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobiotic"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Glutathione reductase","weight":0.721372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_reductase"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.710976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.573664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Lipoic acid","weight":0.442819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.343164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.297966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"S-Adenosyl methionine","weight":0.130801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Adenosyl_methionine"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Presidency of George W.
