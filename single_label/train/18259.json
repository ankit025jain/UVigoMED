{"id":18259,"title":"An unusual cause of breast lump: isolated tuberculosis of the breast.","abstract":"A 60-year-old woman presented with a painful lump of 4 months duration in her right breast. She denied any history of breast trauma or family history of breast cancer. Physical examination detected a firm, tender mass in the upper inner quadrant of her right breast without an associated sinus tract. Cytology from fine-needle aspiration of the swelling showed epithelioid cells, lymphohistocytic aggregates, and necrosis. Diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of acid-fast bacilli in tissue sections using Ziehl-Neelsen staining.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808245","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.714481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.445666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Breast lump","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_lump"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.372165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.169228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Epithelioid cell","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelioid_cell"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 60","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_60"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}]}
