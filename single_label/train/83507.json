{"id":83507,"title":"[Tissue hypoxia and related metabolic changes of homeostasis during vibration load in athletes].","abstract":"We explored the efficacy and the mechanisms of influence on physical performance of vibratory loads in the \"whole body vibration\" (WBV) at a frequency of 50 Hz, amplitude of 30 mm and a running time of 30 minutes, which was performed after each standard training sessions in athletes for 3 weeks. WBV vibration causes an occurrence ofhypoxia, as evidenced by the end of the study the serum growth athletes content HIF- 1 a with 0.89+/-0.03 to 1.3 1+/-0.01 ngxml-1, which is substantially higher than in control (1.04+/-0.02 ngxml-1). Simultaneously, it is activated such a HIF-1 alpha-dependent process as erythropoiesis: the contents of red blood cells increases at the end of the study to 6.04+/-0.11x10(12) 1-1 (control only to 5.23+/-0.12x10(12)xl-1). Intensification of angiogenic stimuli under the influence of hypoxia is manifested by a significant two times increase in the serum levels of the main angiogenesis factor VEGF (to 62.3+6.8 pgxml-1, from the control level of 32.7+/-4.7 pgxml-1 Vibration loads are accompanied by a lack of oxidative stress, an important ergolytic factor. In contrast, they activate nonenzymatic antioxidant system unit, resulting in an increase in the content of reduced glutathione in the cell membranes. We detected a reduction in endogenous toxicity and improvement of humoral immunity and, as a result, an improvement of physical performance in athletes.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335236","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Erythropoiesis","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoiesis"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.697312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.354274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Vibration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"}]}
