{"id":43037,"title":"p27 expression in post-treatment rectal cancer: a potential novel approach for predicting residual nodal disease.","abstract":"Expression profiles of p21, p27, p53, Ki-67, and thymidylate synthase may be associated with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The relationship between post-treatment protein expression and regional lymph node involvement has not been fully explored.Tumor cores from 126 rectal cancer patients underwent immunohistochemical analysis for the aforementioned proteins. Staining indices (SIs) using percentage of stained cells and staining intensity were calculated for 10 tumor cores per patient. SI for each marker was compared between node negative and node positive patients.Twenty-six (20.6%) cancer patients had a pathologic complete response and 37 had inadequate tissue or cancer cells, leaving 63 for analysis. Thirty-seven (58.7%) cancer patients were node negative and 26 (41.3%) were node positive. There was an association between increased p27 SI and nodal positivity (P = .04).Increased p27 expression in post-treatment rectal cancer is associated with nodal positivity and may determine which patients are suitable for local excision.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814310","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.469615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.461534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.382867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Thymidylate synthase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidylate_synthase"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"CDKN1B","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN1B"},{"name":"Thymidine monophosphate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
