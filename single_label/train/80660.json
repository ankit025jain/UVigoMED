{"id":80660,"title":"Gauche(+) side-chain orientation as a key factor in the search for an immunogenic peptide mixture leading to a complete fully protective vaccine.","abstract":"Topological and stereo-electron characteristics are essential in major histocompability class II-peptide-T-cell receptor (MHC-p-TCR) complex formation for inducing an appropriate immune response. Modified high activity binding peptides (mHABPs) were synthesised for complete full protection antimalarial vaccine development producing a large panel of individually fully protection-inducing protein structures (FPIPS) and very high long-lasting antibody-inducing (VHLLAI) mHABPs. Most of those which did not interfere, compete, inhibit or suppress their individual VHLLAI or FPIPS activity contained or displayed a polyproline II-like (PPIIL) structure when mixed. Here we show that amino acid side-chains located in peptide binding region (PBR) positions p3 and p7 displayed specific electron charges and side-chain gauche(+) orientation for interacting with the TCR. Based on the above, and previously described physicochemical principles, non-interfering, long-lasting, full protection-inducing, multi-epitope, multistage, minimal subunit-based chemically synthesised mHABP mixtures can be designed for developing vaccines against diseases scourging humankind, malaria being one of them.
