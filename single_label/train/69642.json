{"id":69642,"title":"Imaging thyroid disease: updates, imaging approach, and management pearls.","abstract":"There are many disorders that can occur in the thyroid gland, ranging from benign to malignant entities. This article focuses on 5 common problems of the thyroid that require special consideration with regard to optimizing imaging strategies in a multidisciplinary and collaborative platform. These problems are the incidental thyroid nodule, preoperative evaluation of goiter, hyperthyroidism, invasive thyroid cancer, and recurrent thyroid cancer. For each problem essential facts, interesting updates, imaging approach, and management pearls are reviewed.
