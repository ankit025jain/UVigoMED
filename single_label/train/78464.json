{"id":78464,"title":"Oleaceae pollen allergy and its cross-reactivity in the mediterranean area in the context of globalization.","abstract":"Opening frontiers has led in the last two decades to a massive migration of Romanians to Spain and Italy, two countries known to have large areas planted with olives. Romania owns large areas planted with ash forests. Because of cross-reactivity between these two trees belonging to the Oleaceae family and the big allergenic potential of olive pollens, after a number of years of residence in these countries, many Romanians will present allergic respiratory symptoms of rhinitis and asthma, both in the season of olive pollination and ash pollination.
