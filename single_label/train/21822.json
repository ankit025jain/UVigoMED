{"id":21822,"title":"Dr Thomas Aitchison Latta (c1796-1833): pioneer of intravenous fluid replacement in the treatment of cholera.","abstract":"In 1832 pandemic cholera travelled across Europe with devastating mortality. Before this, doctors had speculated on the benefits of intravenous therapy but none had tried. Only in 1832 did Thomas Latta perform intravenous infusions. This treatment disappeared after Latta's death. This was mainly due to general medical scepticism, lack of biochemical and physiological knowledge and poor patient selection. Finally, there were no further pandemics comparable with that of 1832 to provide the catalyst to accelerate medical development in this field.
