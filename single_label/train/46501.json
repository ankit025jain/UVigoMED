{"id":46501,"title":"Pancreatic panniculitis: a rare complication of pancreatitis secondary to ERCP.","abstract":"Panniculitis is an uncommon and rare complication of systemic fat necrosis in patients with pancreatic diseases. The skin manifestations are independent of the severity of the pancreatic pathology and can occur at any time. The lesions can precede, be concomitant with or rarely follow the pancreatic illness. We report a case of acute pancreatitis post Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Pancreatography (ERCP) for common bile duct stone, with subcutaneous panniculitis. We noted a complete resolution within two weeks after the treatment of the pancreatic pathology.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630514","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.833344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.817794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.664112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.527951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Panniculitis","weight":0.379295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panniculitis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.365899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Fat necrosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_necrosis"}]}
