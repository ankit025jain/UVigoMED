{"id":69311,"title":"Comparisons between the 2012 new CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equations and other four approved equations.","abstract":"The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) reported two equations in 2012: one based on cystatin C concentration (CKD-EPI2012cys) and the other using both serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations (CKD-EPI2012Scr-cys). We compared the adaptability of new formulae with other four equations.Participants (n?=?788; median age, 54 [range, 19-94] years) were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The reference glomerular filtration rate (rGFR) was measured by a (99)mTc-DTPA renal dynamic imaging method, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated separately by the Chinese adapted Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation (C-MDRD), MacIsaac, Ma, serum creatinine-based CKD-EPI equation (CKD-EPI2009Scr), CKD-EPI2012cys and CKD-EPI2012Scr-cys equations. We compared the performance of six equations with rGFR.Median rGFR was 76.35 (interquartile range, 59.03-92.50) mL/min/1.73 m(2). Compared with CKD-EPI2009Scr, CKD-EPI2012Scr-cys formula had better diagnostic value with larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC(AUC), 0.879, p?=?0.006), especially in young participants (ROC(AUC), 0.883, p?=?0.005). CKD-EPI2012cys equation did not perform better than other available equations. Accuracy (the proportion of eGFR within 30% of rGFR [P30]) of the CKD-EPI2012Scr-cys equation (77.03%) was inferior only to MacIsaac equation (80.2%) in the entire participants, but performed best in young participants with normal or mildly-injured GFR. Neither of the two new CKD-EPI equations achieved any ideal P30 in the elderly participants with moderately-severely injured GFR. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a consistent result. In this study, CKD-EPI2012Scr-cys had a relatively better diagnosis consistency of GFR stage between the eGFR and rGFR in the whole cohort.CKD-EPI2012Scr-cys appeared less biased and more accurate in overall participants. Neither of the new CKD-EPI equations achieved ideal accuracy in senior participants with moderately-severely injured GFR. A large-scale study with more subjects and cooperating centers to develop new formulae for the elderly is assumed to be necessary.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24454737","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.758285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.604802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.586164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.57098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.541137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.465351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.430391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.180511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.113354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Cystatin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin"},{"name":"Cystatin C","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin_C"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}]}
