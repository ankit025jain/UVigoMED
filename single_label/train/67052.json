{"id":67052,"title":"Participation changes in sexual functioning after mild stroke.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which people with mild stroke experience changes in participation in sexual activity post stroke. A cross-sectional study was completed with adults 6 to 18 months post mild stroke (N = 13); a brief case study was also done with one of the participants. Participants completed an assessment battery over the telephone that included the modified Quality of Sexual Function scale, the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The sample reported mild problems with sexual dysfunction (mean = 10.77, SD = 4.09). Sexual dysfunction post stroke was highly correlated (r(2) = -0.372 to -0.875) with all of the domains on the SIS. Several participants in this study reported that they would have liked more information about sexual functioning post stroke. These findings suggest that individuals with mild stroke are experiencing decreased participation in sexual activities post stroke and would like more information from the health care community on the potential for sexual changes.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652075","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.693564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.469411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.415013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.384048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.309191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Sexual attraction","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Patient Health Questionnaire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Health_Questionnaire"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"875","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/875"},{"name":"372","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372"},{"name":"Briefcase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briefcase"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Secret Intelligence Service","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
