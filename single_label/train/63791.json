{"id":63791,"title":"Ovarian lymphoma and hydronephrosis.","abstract":"Ovarian lymphoma is a rare entity, and hydronephrosis from lymphoma is even rarer. Most reports describe a laparoscopic approach to the disease, but we report a case of hydroureteronephrosis associated with ovarian lymphoma managed completely by miniinvasive techniques.A 51-year-old woman was referred to us for back pain and renal colic and computed tomography scan findings of right hydroureteronephrosis and a mass in the right mesorectum and uterosacral ligament. After magnetic resonance imaging was performed, the patient underwent laparoscopic adnexectomy and ureterolysis after ureteroscopy and stenting. Histology results showed diffuse B-cell lymphoma of the ovary occluding the ureter without infiltration. The patient has undergone 6 cycles of chemotherapy.This is the first report to describe ovarian lymphoma and hydroureteronephrosis managed completely by laparoscopic surgery and endoscopy. Frequency in clinical practice, differential diagnosis, and endoscopic approach are discussed. The advantages of a multidisciplinary endoscopic team are underlined.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398216","annotations":[{"name":"Renal colic","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_colic"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Hydronephrosis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronephrosis"},{"name":"Ureteroscopy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureteroscopy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.810215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.659091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.270298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Horse colic","weight":0.156055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_colic"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.134341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Uterosacral ligament","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterosacral_ligament"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
