{"id":86017,"title":"Fewer hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in communities with smoke-free public policies.","abstract":"We determined the impact of smoke-free municipal public policies on hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).We conducted a secondary analysis of hospital discharges with a primary diagnosis of COPD in Kentucky between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2011 using Poisson regression. We compared the hospitalization rates of regions with and without smoke-free laws, adjusting for personal and population covariates, seasonality, secular trends over time, and geographic region.Controlling for covariates such as sex, age, length of stay, race/ethnicity, education, income, and urban-rural status, among others, we found that those living in a community with a comprehensive smoke-free law or regulation were 22% less likely to experience hospitalizations for COPD than those living in a community with a moderate-weak law or no law. Those living in a community with an established law were 21% less likely to be hospitalized for COPD than those with newer laws or no laws.Strong smoke-free public policies may provide protection against COPD hospitalizations, particularly after 12 months, with the potential to save lives and decrease health care costs.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825207","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.441668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.426523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.417136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Kentucky","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.341325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Public policy","weight":0.276982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy"},{"name":"Secularity","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.0269276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"June 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_30"},{"name":"July 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_1"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Secondary data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_data"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Seasonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
