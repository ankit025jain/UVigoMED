{"id":78360,"title":"Simultaneous labyrinthectomy with cochlear implantation in patients with bilateral Ménière's disease.","abstract":"The development of second-side Ménière's disease in the only remaining serviceable ear is difficult to treat. We describe an intervention to control disabling disease combining a labyrinthectomy and cochlear implant to restore hearing.Following a thorough preoperative assessment and consenting process, 2 patients underwent labyrinthectomy of the affected ear with simultaneous cochlear implantation.Both patients achieved control of Ménière's attacks with improved hearing rehabilitation. Oscillopsia was noted by both patients. Both patients were pleased to have undergone the treatment.Severe symptomatic second-side Ménière's disease in the only hearing ear is uncommon. We report the successful treatment of 2 patients in this difficult management scenario, by simultaneous surgical labyrinthectomy and cochlear implantation. We propose this as a potential management strategy in this rare but complex group of patients in whom all less destructive measures have failed.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690980","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.559736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.481623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.403889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.273852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.131773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oscillopsia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillopsia"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"}]}
