{"id":89716,"title":"Cutaneous decompression sickness.","abstract":"A probable case of decompression illness with associated cutis marmorata is presented, which regressed over a few hours with oxygen breathing and after intravenous methylprednisolone and fluid resuscitation without recompression. He was eventually transferred for hyperbaric treatment some 10 hours post dive. Cutaneous decompression illness is not associated with high mortality per se, but prompt and accurate recognition is warranted, as it may represent a prodromal feature of potentially life-threatening complications. However, in this case, as differential diagnosis, an allergic reaction remains possible.
