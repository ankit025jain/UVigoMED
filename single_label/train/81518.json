{"id":81518,"title":"Erosion in relation to nutrition and the environment.","abstract":"When considering the erosive potential of a food or drink, a number of factors must be taken into account. pH is arguably the single most important parameter in determining the rate of erosive tissue dissolution. There is no clear-cut critical pH for erosion as there is for caries. At low pH, it is possible that other factors are sufficiently protective to prevent erosion, but equally erosion can progress in acid of a relatively high pH in the absence of mitigating factors. Calcium and phosphate concentration, in combination with pH, determine the degree of saturation with respect to tooth minerals. Solutions supersaturated with respect to enamel or dentine will not cause them to dissolve, meaning that given sufficient common ion concentrations erosion will not proceed, even if the pH is low. Interestingly, the addition of calcium is more effective than phosphate at reducing erosion in acid solutions. Today, several calcium-enriched soft drinks are on the market, and acidic products with high concentrations of calcium and phosphorus are available (such as yoghurt), which do not soften the dental hard tissues. The greater the buffering capacity of the drink or food, the longer it will take for the saliva to neutralize the acid. A higher buffer capacity of a drink or foodstuff will enhance the processes of dissolution because more release of ions from the tooth mineral is required to render the acid inactive for further demineralization. Temperature is also a significant physical factor; for a given acidic solution, erosion proceeds more rapidly the higher the temperature of that solution. In recent years, a number of interesting potentially erosion-reducing drink and food additives have been investigated.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993263","annotations":[{"name":"Phosphorus","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.802062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Yoghurt","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoghurt"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Supersaturation","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersaturation"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.680777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.632986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Soft drink","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.588187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Alkali","weight":0.538096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.515093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.509115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.393882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.363982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Neutralization (chemistry)","weight":0.309423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralization_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Buffering agent","weight":0.227016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffering_agent"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.183204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Clearcutting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearcutting"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"}]}
