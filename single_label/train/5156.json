{"id":5156,"title":"Antioxidant and anxiolytic activities of Crataegus nigra Wald. et Kit. berries.","abstract":"Hawthorn has been present for a long time in traditional medicine as antihypertensive, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective, antimicrobial agent. Hawthorn can be used for the cure of stress, nervousness but there is no published paper about actions of Crataegus nigra Wald. et Kit. fruits. The present study was carried out to test free-radical-scavenging and anxiolytic activity of C. nigra fruits. DPPH (alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl) assay was used to measure antioxidant activity. BHT, BHA, PG, quercetin and rutin were used as standards. The total amount of phenolic compounds, procyanidins, and flavonoids in the extracts, was determined spectrophotometrically. Results were expressed as equivalents of gallic acid, cyanidin chloride and quercetin equivalents, respectively. LC-MS/MS was used for identification and quantification of phenolic composition. The anxiety effect, expressed as the difference in time spent in the open and closed arms, was measured and compared between groups. Phenolic compound content of Crataegus nigra fruits was 72.7 mg/g. Yield of total flavonoid aglycones was 0.115 mg/g. Procyanidins were 5.6 mg/g. DPPH radical-scavenging capacity of the extracts showed linear concentration dependency, IC50 value were 27.33 microg/mL. Anxiolytic effect was observed. Species Crataegus nigra fruits hydroalcoholic extract showed antioxidant and anxiolytic activity.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272648","annotations":[{"name":"Rutin","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutin"},{"name":"Anxiolytic","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic"},{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Cyanidin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanidin"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Gallic acid","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_acid"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.829553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Proanthocyanidin","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proanthocyanidin"},{"name":"Berry","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry"},{"name":"Phenolic compounds in wine","weight":0.75335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenolic_compounds_in_wine"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Traditional medicine","weight":0.696202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine"},{"name":"Phenol","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Aglycone","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglycone"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.500024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Crataegus","weight":0.407073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crataegus"},{"name":"DPPH","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPPH"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.348623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Butylated hydroxytoluene","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butylated_hydroxytoluene"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenols","weight":0.237531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenols"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Crataegus nigra","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crataegus_nigra"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Leaf shape","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_shape"},{"name":"Butylated hydroxyanisole","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butylated_hydroxyanisole"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Hypolipidemic agent","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypolipidemic_agent"}]}
