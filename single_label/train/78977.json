{"id":78977,"title":"[Noise pollution in the OR, who should take the lead?].","abstract":"This commentary discusses the article by Engelmann on noise reduction in the OR. The investigators managed to reduce average noise levels by 5%, with a > 50% reduction in peak levels. This led to a reduction in overall complications, and promoted working satisfaction. The author of the commentary calls for awareness, and puts the surgeon in the lead in controlling noise and music in order to guarantee optimal patient safety and to stimulate working satisfaction.
