{"id":24466,"title":"RNAi knock-down of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei Toll gene and immune deficiency gene reveals their difference in regulating antimicrobial peptides transcription.","abstract":"NF-?B dependent antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are of critical importance in protecting insects or mammals from microorganisms infection. However, we still do not make clear signaling pathways in regulating AMPs expression in shrimps. In this study, RNAi approach was used to study differences between Toll signaling pathway and immune deficiency signaling pathway in regulating the transcription of NF-?B dependent AMPs post bacteria challenge. Results showed that the transcription level of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor was highly suppressed in Litopenaeus vannamei immune deficiency (LvIMD) silenced shrimps by gene specific dsRNA compared to Litopenaeus vannamei Toll (LvToll) silenced shrimps with or without Vibrio anguillarum and Micrococcus lysodeikticus challenge. Conversely the transcription level of penaeidin3a was significantly suppressed in LvToll silenced shrimps compared to LvIMD silenced shrimps. However, no obvious difference was found in regulating the transcription of CrustinP. Meanwhile, we found that silencing LvToll both down regulated the transcription of Dorsal and Relish while silencing LvIMD only down regulated the transcription of Relish. At last, shrimp survival experiment showed that post V. anguillarum challenge high mortality was found both in LvToll and LvIMD silenced groups while post M. lysodeikticus challenge we saw high mortality only in LvToll silenced group. Hence, we conclude that shrimp L. vannamei Toll pathway and IMD pathway might be different in regulating the transcription of NF-?B dependent AMPs and responding to bacteria challenge but not independent of each other.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434197","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Antimicrobial peptides","weight":0.734641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_peptides"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.700863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Insect","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.674419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.651253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.53254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.327047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Shrimp","weight":0.318346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.287041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Toll (gene)","weight":0.200698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_(gene)"},{"name":"DsRNA","weight":0.132731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DsRNA"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Micrococcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrococcus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"National Film Board of Canada","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
