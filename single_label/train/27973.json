{"id":27973,"title":"[The role of a molecule associated with drug dependence, shati/nat8l].","abstract":"Various molecules are involved in drug addiction induced by drugs of abuse. Therefore, the mechanism of drug addiction is still not clear, and it has been a difficulty in the development of preventive and curative drugs for drug dependence. We tried to identify the molecules associated with drug dependence, and found three molecules including shati/nat81. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the substrate for shati/nat81 is aspaltate and shati/nat8l biosynthesizes N-acetylaspartate, which exists abundantly in the mammalian brain. In this study, we investigated the physiological function of shati/nat81 and the role of shati/nat81 in drug dependence. The overexpression of shati/nat81 in the dorsal striatum of mice led to social abnormality and depression-like behavior, and worsened a part of the motor dysfunction induced by Ca2+ channel agonist BAY-K 8644. The overexpression of shati/nat81 in the nucleus accumbens of mice inhibited methamphetamine-induced behavioral and biochemical abnormalities. These findings suggest that the shati/nat81-associated system could play a role in the regulation of mental activity and motor action, and be a new target in the development of therapeutic drugs for drug dependence.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069253","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleus accumbens","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.749501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.628037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.612303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.583118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.425669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.419527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.401339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.320291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Motor skill","weight":0.261966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_skill"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Dorsal striatum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_striatum"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Tardive dyskinesia","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
