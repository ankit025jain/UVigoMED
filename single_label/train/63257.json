{"id":63257,"title":"Kawasaki Disease has so much to teach us!","abstract":"Kawasaki Disease (KD) is primarily a childhood vasculitis of mid-size muscular arteries, of which the coronary arteries (CA) are most clinically significant. Although timely treatment with pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has significantly reduced CA pathology, as determined by ECHO cardiology, about 30% of children still develop potentially fatal aneurysms, thrombi, or stenosis. This paper describes several additional pathologies and phenomena of undetermined significance, e.g. myocarditis, endocarditis with fibroelastosis, adrenal medullary necrosis, arterial smooth muscle cell transition into proliferating myofibroblasts, pneumonia in patients dying from KD, and calcification of organizing thrombi.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460693","annotations":[{"name":"Myocarditis","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis"},{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.805736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.77861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Kawasaki disease","weight":0.483969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.408194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Medulla oblongata","weight":0.168036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulla_oblongata"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Adrenal medulla","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_medulla"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
