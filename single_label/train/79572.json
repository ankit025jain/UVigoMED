{"id":79572,"title":"Primary axillary hydatid cyst.","abstract":"Echinococcosis (hydatid disease) is a zoonosis caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus (or Taenia echinococcus). The adult form of the parasite lives in the gut of the dog, while the intermediate hosts, where the tapeworm develops to larval stage are cats, cattle, pigs and humans(considered to be accidental intermediate hosts). The parasite has a worldwide distribution, but the endemic areas are Canada and Alaska, Australia, New Zealand, South America and the Mediterranean region. Hydatid cyst can grow many years before the symptoms and clinical signs appear. The liver and the lungs are the most affected organs, but primary location of the hydatid disease in the axilla is extremely rare. In our country we did not find any records of axillary hydatid disease, while the literature contains only 12 cases of axillary location. We present the case of a woman, 60 years old, with a primary axillary location of hydatid cyst, who underwent a total cystectomy.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149625","annotations":[{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Cestoda","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.691531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.691361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.663138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Alaska","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.606228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Echinococcus granulosus","weight":0.578049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_granulosus"},{"name":"Mediterranean Sea","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.519239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.516275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.323896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.274005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.201208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mediterranean Basin","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin"},{"name":"Cosmopolitan distribution","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_distribution"},{"name":"Intermediate host","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_host"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Taeniasis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taeniasis"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
