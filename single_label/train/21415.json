{"id":21415,"title":"Epidemiology and carbapenem resistance mechanisms of carbapenem-non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected during 2009-11 in 14 European and Mediterranean countries.","abstract":"To evaluate the genetic relatedness and carbapenem resistance mechanisms among carbapenem-non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected during 2009-11 in 14 European and Mediterranean countries.Doripenem-non-susceptible (MIC >2 mg/L) isolates were tested for susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, aztreonam, ceftazidime and cefepime with and without phenyl-arginine-?-naphthylamide (PA?N) (efflux inhibitor) and/or cloxacillin (AmpC inhibitor). Carbapenemase screening was performed by PCR and sequencing. Expression of chromosomal ampC, mexA, mexC, mexE and mexX was determined by quantitative real-time PCR using P. aeruginosa PAO1 or a group of susceptible isolates as baseline. Clonality was evaluated by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing.Among 529 (25.6% overall) carbapenem-non-susceptible P. aeruginosa, 106 were positive for metallo-?-lactamase (M?L) genes encoding VIM-2 (76 strains), VIM-4 (14), VIM-1 (7) and VIM-5 (5). IMP-15 and three new M?Ls (IMP-33, VIM-36 and VIM-37) were detected in one strain each. An increasing prevalence of M?L producers was noted in 2011 (30.6%) compared with previous years (13.4% and 12.3% in 2009 and 2010, respectively). Isolates displayed high genetic diversity, with 401 unique profiles detected. CC235 and ST111 were detected among M?L-producing clusters. The PA?N/cloxacillin effect ranged from 90.0% to 56.5%/from 1.3% to 21.2%. OprD decrease/loss was the most prevalent intrinsic mechanism and was detected among 94.9% of the P. aeruginosa, followed by AmpC (44.4%) and MexAB-OprM (20.1%). When using the susceptible group of isolates as baseline, MexAB-OprM became as prevalent as OprD decrease/loss.Increasing M?L prevalence is worrisome in various European countries; however, intrinsic resistance mechanisms in a highly genetically diverse population of carbapenem-non-susceptible P. aeruginosa are probably a matter for greater concern in these countries.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603963","annotations":[{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Cefepime","weight":0.731565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefepime"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.685231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.626364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.615553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.531935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.508257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.475994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.453651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Ceftazidime","weight":0.446557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.438815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Efflux (microbiology)","weight":0.367874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efflux_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Aztreonam","weight":0.338355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztreonam"},{"name":"Cloxacillin","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloxacillin"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.247671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Doripenem","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doripenem"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.215389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mediterranean Sea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0179148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Coefficient of relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Kin selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"}]}
