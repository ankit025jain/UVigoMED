{"id":56853,"title":"Association of pattern reversal VEP parameters with the mean defect of Humphrey visual field in patients of primary open angle glaucoma.","abstract":"Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive bilateral optic neuropathy which disturbs the structural or functional integrity of the optic nerve that causes characteristic atrophic changes in it, which leads to specific visual field defects over time with loss of visual function. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma in India and is fast emerging as a major cause of bilateral blindness. This rural hospital based study was conducted to evaluate whether glaucomatous visual field defects particularly the mean defect of Humphrey visual field could be related to VEP parameters of patients having POAG. Visual field by Humphrey perimeter and simultaneous recordings of pattern reversal visual evoked potential (PRVEP) were assessed in 100 patients with POAG. There was a significant (P < 0.05) negative correlation of P100 latency, N155 latency and P100 duration and a highly significant (P < 0.001) positive correlation of P100 amplitude with mean deviation (index of global visual field damage, MD) of Humphrey visual field in the subjects of POAG in various age groups. N70 latency showed a non-significant positive correlation with MD. The VEP changes observed by us in POAG patients were consistent with the progressing mean defect quantitatively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the VEP parameters can be useful quantitative indices in the evaluation of glaucomatous visual function damage.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Eye
