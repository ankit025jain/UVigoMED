{"id":84628,"title":"Non-HLA genes in ankylosing spondylitis: what meta-analyses have shown?","abstract":"HLA-B27 association with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is one of the strongest ever reported in the literature. However, only a small proportion of 5-8% of HLA-B27 positive individuals of the general population develops the disease. In recent years, polymorphisms of many non-HLA genes were reported to be associated with AS. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of non-HLA genetic factors contributing to AS susceptibility based on meta-analyses in order to overcome the limitations of individual genetic studies e.g. the small samples' sizes, the small samples' origin diversities, and the low statistical power of statistical analyses.
