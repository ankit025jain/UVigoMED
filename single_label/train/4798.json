{"id":4798,"title":"Describing readmissions to an Ebola case management centre (CMC), Sierra Leone, 2014.","abstract":"Case management centres (CMCs) are part of the outbreak control plan for Ebola virus disease (EVD). A CMC in Sierra Leone had 33% (138/419) of primary admissions discharged as EVD negative (not a case). Fifteen of these were readmitted within 21 days, nine of which were EVD positive. All readmissions had contact with an Ebola case in the community in the previous 21 days indicating that the infection was likely acquired outside the CMC.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25323075","annotations":[{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0471926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ebola","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"},{"name":"Sierra Leone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone"},{"name":"Commandant of the Marine Corps","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Enhanced Versatile Disc","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Versatile_Disc"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"}]}
