{"id":31071,"title":"Clarithromycin induced psoriasis in a 37-year old man.","abstract":"Many drugs may induce psoriatic lesions or exacerbate preexisting psoriasis. We report an exceptional case of psoriasis vulgaris probably induced by clarithromycin. A 37-year-old man was prescribed for pharyngitis clarithromycin 500mg twice a day. On the third day of treatment, he presented a non pruriginous erythemato-squamous eruption, of trunk and limbs. Skin biopsy showed a typical aspect of psoriasis vulgaris. The drug was interrupted and the patient was treated by topical corticoids with rapid improvement.
