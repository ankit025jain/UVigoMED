{"id":87442,"title":"Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis using 3D printing for shaft fractures of clavicles: technical note.","abstract":"This article describes a minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis technique for midshaft fractures of clavicles using intramedullary indirect reduction and prebent plates with 3D printing models. This technique allows for easy reduction of fractures with accurate prebent plates and minimal soft tissue injury around the fracture site.
