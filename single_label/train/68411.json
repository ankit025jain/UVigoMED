{"id":68411,"title":"Imaging and interventional therapy for varicoceles.","abstract":"Varicocele is a common treatable cause of testicular pain, male infertility, and Leydig cell dysfunction. Scrotal ultrasonography has become the modality of choice in the diagnosis and post-treatment follow-up of varicocele. Visualization of dilated veins and reflux into the pampiniform plexus enables accurate diagnosis. Although the pathophysiology of varicocele in testicular dysfunction remains unclear, numerous studies have established significant improvement in the seminal parameters and pregnancy rates after varicocele repair. Interventional therapy is a minimally invasive effective treatment option for primary and salvage varicocele repair. This review discusses sonographic criteria used in the pre- and post-procedural evaluation of varicocele and various interventional techniques for varicocele treatment.
