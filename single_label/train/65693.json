{"id":65693,"title":"[Regulatory mechanism of NF-kappaB signaling pathway on renal tissue inflammation in chronic kidney disease and interventional effect of traditional Chinese medicine].","abstract":"In chronic kidney disease (CKD), inflammatory responses during the progression of renal tissue and tissue injury related causes its progression to end-state renal disease. Among them, nuclear factor (nuclear factor, NF)-kappaB signaling pathway by regulating the corresponding nuclear expression of target gene transcription, as well as affecting the synthesis of inflammatory mediators, induction of inflammation lead to kidney damage and renal fibrosis. Some single herbs and their extracts (such as Astragali Radix, Scutellariae Radix, Ginkgo Folium) and some traditional Chinese medicine (such as Danggui Buxue decoction, Qilian decoction) can reduce the inflammatory damage induced by renal tissue NF-kappaB signaling pathway and delay the progression of CKD.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791524","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.777944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.728931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.662795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.499584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"China","weight":0.401674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.345779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.333448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Decoction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoction"},{"name":"Ginkgo biloba","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"}]}
