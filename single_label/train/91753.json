{"id":91753,"title":"Neonatal infraorbital nerve crush-induced CNS synaptic plasticity and functional recovery.","abstract":"Infraorbital nerve (ION) transection in neonatal rats leads to disruption of whisker-specific neural patterns (barrelettes), conversion of functional synapses into silent synapses, and reactive gliosis in the brain stem trigeminal principal nucleus (PrV). Here we tested the hypothesis that neonatal peripheral nerve crush injuries permit better functional recovery of associated central nervous system (CNS) synaptic circuitry compared with nerve transection. We developed an in vitro whisker pad-trigeminal ganglion (TG)-brain stem preparation in neonatal rats and tested functional recovery in the PrV following ION crush. Intracellular recordings revealed that 68% of TG cells innervate the whisker pad. We used the proportion of whisker pad-innervating TG cells as an index of ION function. The ION function was blocked by ?64%, immediately after mechanical crush, then it recovered beginning after 3 days postinjury and was complete by 7 days. We used this reversible nerve-injury model to study peripheral nerve injury-induced CNS synaptic plasticity. In the PrV, the incidence of silent synapses increased to ?3.5 times of control value by 2-3 days postinjury and decreased to control levels by 5-7 days postinjury. Peripheral nerve injury-induced reaction of astrocytes and microglia in the PrV was also reversible. Neonatal ION crush disrupted barrelette formation, and functional recovery was not accompanied by de novo barrelette formation, most likely due to occurrence of recovery postcritical period (P3) for pattern formation. Our results suggest that nerve crush is more permissive for successful regeneration and reconnection (collectively referred to as \"recovery\" here) of the sensory inputs between the periphery and the brain stem.
