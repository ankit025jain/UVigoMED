{"id":65754,"title":"Quality of life in end stage renal disease: a concept analysis.","abstract":"This concept analysis examines quality of life (QOL) in the context of end stage renal disease (ESRD).Quality of life is a multidimensional concept historically used by governmental bodies to measure society's satisfaction of economic and social outcomes. However, health care researchers have demonstrated that the concept of QOL relates to a deeper meaning of an individual's experience of life and health.Walker and Avant's (2010) framework of concept analysis was chosen to provide conceptual clarity for nephrology nurses and allied health care professionals.The CINHAL, EBSCO, ERIC, Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were searched for the period of 1998-2013 for literature published in English and French with a focus of peer-reviewed journals from disciplines of health sciences and psychology.Consequent to this concept analysis, QOL has been defined by three defining attributes, such as the ability to engage in vigorous activities, the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), and the ability to engage in family, social, and occupational roles.These findings enable a clear and functional definition of the concept of QOL in the context of ESRD, therefore facilitating the ability of nephrology nurses and allied health care professionals to assess clients' needs and improve their health care outcomes through their lived experience.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Male Urogenital
