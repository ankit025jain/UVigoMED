{"id":56436,"title":"Overnight orthokeratology is comparable with atropine in controlling myopia.","abstract":"Many efforts have been invested in slowing progression of myopia. Among the methods, atropine administration and orthokeratology (OK) are most widely used. This study analyzed the efficacy of atropine and OK lens in controlling myopia progression and elongation of axial length.This retrospective study included 105 patients (210 eyes) who wore OK lenses and 105 patients (210 eyes) who applied 0.125% atropine every night during the 3 following period. Student t-test, linear regression analysis, repeated measure ANOVA, and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used for statistical analysis.The change in axial length per year was 0.28 ± 0.08 mm, 0.30 ± 0.09 mm, and 0.27 ± 0.10 mm in the OK lens group, and 0.38 ± 0.09 mm, 0.37 ± 0.12 mm, and 0.36 ± 0.08 mm in the atropine group for years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed an increase in myopia of 0.28 D and 0.34 D per year, and an increase in axial length of 0.28 mm and 0.37 mm per year in the OK lens and atropine groups, respectively. Repeated measure ANOVA showed significant differences in myopia (p = 0.001) and axial length (p < 0.001) between the atropine and OK lens groups; in astigmatism, there was no significant difference in these parameters (p = 0.320). Comparison of increases in axial length in relation to baseline myopia showed significant correlations both in the OK lens group (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.259; p < 0.001) and atropine group (r = 0.169; p = 0.014). High myopia patients benefited more from both OK lenses and atropine than did low myopia patients. The correlation of baseline myopia and myopia progression was stronger in the OK lens group then in the atropine group.OK lens is a useful method for controlling myopia progression even in high myopia patients.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685184","annotations":[{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.775044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.690492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.383037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.210296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0538916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Atropine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Orthokeratology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthokeratology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"1 millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_millimetre"},{"name":"259","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/259"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Overnight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"28 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_mm_film"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Triassic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"3.7 cm FlaK 43","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3.7_cm_FlaK_43"}]}
