{"id":38411,"title":"Effect of body position and sleep state on obstructive sleep apnea severity in children with Down syndrome.","abstract":"To investigate the influence of sleep position and sleep state on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity in in children with Down syndrome (DS).Retrospective review.Sleep disorders laboratory of a tertiary medical center.Children with Down syndrome and typically developing children matched for age, gender, apneahypopnea index (AHI), and year of polysomnogram.Sleep variables from baseline polysomnography. Sensor-recorded position (supine, prone, lateral) was expressed as the percentage of total sleep time. The AHI was calculated in each sleep state (NREM, REM), position, and position-sleep state combination. Of 76 DS subjects (55% male) the median age and AHI were 4.6 years (range 0.2-17.8 years) and 7.4 events/h (range 0-133). In all subjects, AHI was higher in REM than NREM (p < 0.05); however, the NREM AHI was higher in DS subjects than controls (p < 0.05). Compared to controls, the percentage of prone sleep was greater in DS subjects (p < 0.05), but the percentage of supine or non-supine (prone plus lateral) sleep was no different. For DS subjects alone, NREM AHI was higher in supine than non-supine sleep (p < 0.05).In DS and non-DS children alike, respiratory events are predominantly REM related. However, when matched for OSA severity, children with DS have a higher NREM AHI, which is worse in the supine position, perhaps indicating a positional effect compounded by underlying hypotonia inherent to DS. These findings illustrate the clinical importance of NREM respiratory events in the DS population and implications for treatment options.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24426825","annotations":[{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Hypotonia","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Non-rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.773461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.718721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Proprioception","weight":0.619761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.563904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.0547444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/217"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Positional notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation"},{"name":"Nintendo DS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Apnea-hypopnea index","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea-hypopnea_index"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Uncial 0133","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0133"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Neurotypical","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical"},{"name":"Sleep (operating system)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_(operating_system)"}]}
