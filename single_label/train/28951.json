{"id":28951,"title":"Nature, prevalence and risk factors of alcohol use in an urban slum of Southern India.","abstract":"There is a paucity of data on the use of alcohol in urban slums of southern India.We screened 2811 men for alcohol use via a household-level census in an urban slum in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, and interviewed 220 age- and area-matched pairs of men drinkers and non-drinkers to examine factors associated with alcohol use. Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), a standard instrument, was used to assess risk levels of drinking of 354 drinkers. Prevalence rates were calculated using age- adjusted direct standardization. Odds ratios (ORs) of drinking status and higher-risk drinking were calculated using conditional logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression, respectively.Among all men, we estimated that 46.1% consumed alcohol and 31.4% were hazardous drinkers (19% increased-risk, 7.7% high-risk and 4.7% dependent drinkers). Factors associated with alcohol use were: manual labour occupations (OR 2.08); presence of a common mental disorder (OR 1.50) and smoking (OR 2.08); while Muslim religion was protective (OR 0.43). Factors associated with higher-risk alcohol use were: being reported as a non-drinker during the census (OR 3.96); presence of a common mental disorder (OR 3.83); smoking (OR 1.78); drinking before legal age of 21 years (OR 2.71); spending more than `100 per day on alcohol (OR 6.17); and mainly drinking Indian-made foreign liquor (OR 5.45).High prevalence of hazardous drinking and the factors associated with it suggest the need for population- wide interventions and further investigations to effectively reduce hazardous alcohol use and its harmful effects.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758442","annotations":[{"name":"Tamil Nadu","weight":0.891593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.793405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"India","weight":0.777944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Muslim","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"},{"name":"Religion","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Tamil language","weight":0.540748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.53624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Islam","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"},{"name":"Slum","weight":0.47742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slum"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.470625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.439526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.418003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Distilled beverage","weight":0.394907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.390167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.285607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Vellore","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellore"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"Manual labour","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_labour"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Nature (journal)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Age of consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent"},{"name":"Civil disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
