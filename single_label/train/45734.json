{"id":45734,"title":"Human hepatocellular carcinoma-infiltrating CD4?CD69?Foxp3? regulatory T cell suppresses T cell response via membrane-bound TGF-?1.","abstract":"Tumors can recruit, induce, and expand regulatory T cells (Tregs) to suppress antitumor immune responses for survival and progression. The complicated tumor-related Treg subsets and their functional mechanisms are not fully addressed yet. We have previously identified a novel CD4?CD69?Foxp3? Treg subset in tumor-bearing mice, which suppresses CD4 T cell response via membrane-bound transforming growth factor beta 1 (mTGF-?1) and then promotes tumor progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma patients, here, we identified tumor-infiltrating human CD4?CD69? Tregs which represent ~67.2 % of tumor-infiltrating CD4 T cells that is significantly higher than conventional CD4?CD25?Foxp3? Tregs. They expressed mTGF-?1, PD-1, and CTLA-4, but not CD25 or Foxp3, and only produced a little interleukin (IL)-10 and TGF-?1. More importantly, they significantly suppressed CD4 T cell response via mTGF-?1 in vitro. Furthermore, the percentage of these CD4?CD69? Tregs in tumor tissue was significantly correlated with tumor progression, which is more pronounced at the late stage of cancer patients. Thus, we have identified a tumor-induced new population of human CD4?CD69? Tregs in cancer patients with phenotype of CD25?Foxp3?mTGF-?1?CTLA-4?PD-1?, and these Tregs can suppress antitumor immune response via mTGF-?1. Our results not only enrich the family of Treg subsets, providing new mechanistic insight to tumor-induced immune suppression in human, but also suggest a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.CD4?CD69?Foxp3? regulatory T cells were identified in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. These Treg cells inhibit T cell response via membrane-bound TGF-?. The percentage of these cells was significantly correlated with tumor progression. The percentage of these cells was higher than conventional CD4?CD25?Foxp3? Tregs. These Treg cells not only exist in tumor-bearing mice, but also in cancer patients.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668348","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.897423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"TGF beta 1","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGF_beta_1"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor beta","weight":0.823989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor_beta"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cancer immunotherapy","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.730266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.258384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.203458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.153709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"CTLA-4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTLA-4"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"}]}
