{"id":62881,"title":"[Factor V Leiden in women with repeated IVF failures].","abstract":"A plenty of factors have been connected with embryo implantation and further fetus development. Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) after assisted reproductive technology (ART) forces seeking the causes of decreased endometrial receptivity. A non-haemostatic function of thrombophilic mutations such as Factor V Leiden (FVL) was considered a factor related with endometrial receptivity. One hundred eighty eight women with two or more RIF after in vitro fertilization procedures investigated for carrier status for FVL was compared with carrier status of 97 women without reproductive failure who give a birth of at least one health child. There was no significant difference in carrier status for FVL in patients and controls (5.9% and 7.2% respectively, OR 0.80, 95% CI (0.26-2.73, p>0.05). Negligible higher prevalence of FVL was fond in health subjects compared with women with RIF A slightly positive relationship was found between FVL and embryo implantation. A preliminary determination of thrombophilic status in RIF women could specify needing or rejection of anticoagulant therapy during implantation period.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501874","annotations":[{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.865191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.864161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.783879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.620748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Factor V Leiden","weight":0.15609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_V_Leiden"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.148859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Leiden","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden"},{"name":"Factor V","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_V"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Direct relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_relationship"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Negligible","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible"}]}
