{"id":66662,"title":"Preclinical and clinical studies on cytokine-induced killer cells for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignancy of adult human kidney, which accounts for more than 2Â % of all cancers. RCC generally does not respond well to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are ex vivo activated lymphocytes with potent activity against various tumors and minimal side effects. Here, we summarize the data on preclinical and clinical efficacy of CIK cells for RCC treatment. Our preclinical data show that CIK cells have potent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in an in vivo nude mouse xenograft model. Clinical studies for the treatment of RCC patients indicate that CIK cell therapy can induce favorable responses with no serious side effects. These studies suggest that CIK cells may become a valuable strategy for the treatment of patients with RCC.
