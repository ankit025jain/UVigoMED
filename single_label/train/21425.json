{"id":21425,"title":"Paracoccidioidomycosis in a western Brazilian Amazon State: clinical-epidemiologic profile and spatial distribution of the disease.","abstract":"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic infection caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. PCM is considered one of the most important systemic mycoses in Latin America.This is a clinical, epidemiological, retrospective, quantitative study of PCM cases in patients attending the National Health Service in the State of Rondônia in 1997-2012. The examined variables included sex, age group, year of diagnosis, education level, profession, place of residence, diagnostic test, prior treatment, medication used, comorbidities and case progress.During the study period, 2,163 PCM cases were registered in Rondônia, and the mean annual incidence was 9.4/100,000 people. The municipalities with the highest rates were located in the southeastern region of Rondônia, and the towns of Pimenteiras do Oeste and Espigão do Oeste had the highest rates in the state, which were 39.1/100,000 and 37.4/100,000 people, respectively. Among all cases, 90.2% and 9.8% were observed in men and women, respectively, and most cases (58.2%) were observed in patients aged between 40 and 59 years. Itraconazole was used to treat 91.6% (1,771) of cases, followed by sulfamethoxazole in combination with trimethoprim (4.4% [85] of cases). One hundred thirty-one (6%) patients died.The State of Rondônia has a high incidence of PCM, and the municipalities in the southeastern region of the state were found to have the highest incidence rates of this disease. Our findings suggest that Rondônia is the state in the northern region with the highest mortality rate for PCM.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603739","annotations":[{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.881779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Latin America","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Itraconazole","weight":0.683031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itraconazole"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.658078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.516014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.436254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Trimethoprim","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethoprim"},{"name":"Sulfamethoxazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfamethoxazole"},{"name":"Paracoccidioidomycosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracoccidioidomycosis"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.0182935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Amazon Rainforest","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Western culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"}]}
