{"id":58799,"title":"Detection of novel auto-antigens in patients with recurrent miscarriage: description of an approach and preliminary findings.","abstract":"To develop and test a protocol for isolation of potential auto-antigens from chorionic tissue that may be linked to recurrent miscarriage (RM).The strategy included: 1) isolation of IgGs tightly bound to chorionic tissue of RM patients by protein G chromatography; 2) construction of affinity columns using the chorionic antibodies for isolation of auto-antigens; 3) enrichment of auto-antigens from detergent extracted solution of chorionic proteins by affinity chromatography; 4) separation by dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry identification.Five potential auto-antigens were detected: neutral alpha-glucosidase AB, endoplasmin, transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, putative endoplasmin-like protein, and cytoplasmic actin 2.We developed a strategy for identification of auto-antigens in the chorionic tissue of women with RM, which could be of diagnostic and prognostic value.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891284","annotations":[{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Affinity chromatography","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_chromatography"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.735177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Detergent","weight":0.732061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.581402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.497777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.397819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"ATPase","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATPase"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.29127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.290238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.278625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.237159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.214065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Habitual abortion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_abortion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Flight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight"},{"name":"Separation process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_process"},{"name":"Protein G","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_G"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"}]}
