{"id":79414,"title":"[Vestibular paroxismia].","abstract":"The objective of the present publication was to demonstrate a clinical case of peripheral vestibular paroxismia verified in a woman with the help of the MRI technique. Vestibular paroxismia is a relatively rare disease manifested in such characteristic signs and symptoms as sudden and short-lived episodes of dizziness, unstable gait, and the concomitant vegetative disorders accompanied as a rule by tympanophonia, impairment of hearing, and falls. In typical cases, the duration of such episodes varies from several minutes to a few days. A case of vestibular paroxismia associated with the lesion in the peripheral section of the vestibular system is described; it was caused by compression of the nerve by a blood vessel as shown by means of magnetic resonance imaging of cranial nerves.
