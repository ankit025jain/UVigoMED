{"id":34727,"title":"[Genetic analysis of a family with super-male syndrome].","abstract":"To identify the genetic cause for a family featuring language retardation using combined cytogenetic and molecular genetic methods.Following conventional G-banded karyotype analysis, the additional Y chromosome was identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Whole genome array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was also carried out to detect minor structural chromosomal abnormalities.The proband's karyotype was determined as 47,XY,+?, and the unknown aberrant chromosome was identified as Yqh+ with FISH, MLPA and aCGH. No other chromosomal abnormality was found in the pedigree.Cytogenetic methods combined with FISH, MLPA, and aCGH can efficiently identify the origin of unknown chromosomes and provide accurate clues for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24711034","annotations":[{"name":"Array comparative genomic hybridization","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_comparative_genomic_hybridization"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"DNA ligase","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_ligase"},{"name":"Pedigree chart","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.826211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.794642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Comparative genomic hybridization","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"XYY syndrome","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYY_syndrome"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Molecular genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"XY sex-determination system","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.686102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.616562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.601749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.556958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.323585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.323438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.312081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.278719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_ligation-dependent_probe_amplification"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
