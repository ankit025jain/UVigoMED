{"id":84472,"title":"[Reasons that seedless fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii become small].","abstract":"To study the reasons that the seedless fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii developed to smaller ones.The differences of fruit expanding, gene expressing and cell development were investigated between the triploid and diploid fruits from two strains F050 and F049.The results showed the expanding of triploid fruits was stopped about 20 days after artificial pollination, 10 days earlier than the diploid fruits. Meanwhile, it was also investigated that aux expressing level in the triploid fruits was greatly higher than that in diploid fruits, while its ipt, cyt-p450, spds, cycB, cycD1, cycD3, cdkA, cdkB, exp and xth expressing level were greatly lower than that in diploid fruits. The majority of sarcocarp cells of the triploid fruits kept in the stage of small ones comparing with the diploid fruits.The expression of the genes of the proteins involving cell division and expansion was inhibited as the significant reduction of endogenous IAA, CTK, GA and SPDS after bad fertilization and the embryo abortion, which resulted in the end of division and extension of sarcocarp cells. Above reasons induce small fruits of triploid seedless Siraitia grosvenorii.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095332","annotations":[{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.872311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Pollination","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollination"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.647034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.645249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.443227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.362428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.300978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Parthenocarpy","weight":0.284698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenocarpy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Siraitia grosvenorii","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siraitia_grosvenorii"},{"name":"Phylum","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum"},{"name":"Exponential function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function"},{"name":"March 21","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_21"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"},{"name":"Pollination management","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollination_management"}]}
