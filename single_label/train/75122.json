{"id":75122,"title":"Commentary on Myers et al.: growing role of the innate immunity receptor CD36 in central nervous system diseases.","abstract":"Activation of innate immunity by sterile inflammation has emerged as a key event in selected CNS diseases, with a defining impact on all stages of the pathological process. Due to its multiple functions and assembly with other pattern recognition receptors, the innate immunity receptor CD36 has been implicated in a wide variety of brain pathologies, ranging from acute brain injury to neurodegeneration. However, the role of CD36 is complex involving both tissue destruction, related mainly to oxidative stress and inflammation, and beneficial reparative effects due to the involvement of CD36 in tissue repair and reorganization. A recent paper of Meyer at al. provided novel evidence for a role of CD36 also in spinal cord trauma, a condition in which the effect of CD36 was found to be univocally deleterious. This commentary will provide a brief overview of the pathobiology of CD36 and its expanding role in diseases of the brain and spinal cord.
