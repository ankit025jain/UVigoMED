{"id":88262,"title":"Usefulness of braided polyblend polyethylene suture material for flexor tendon repair in zone II by the side-locking loop technique.","abstract":"Flexor tendon injuries in zone II were treated in 14 fingers of 13 patients with our method. Firstly, a 2-strand core suture was made by the side-locking loop technique using a USP 2-0-sized braided polyblend polyethylene suture, then 7-strand peripheral cross-stitches were added using a USP 5-0-sized monofilament nylon suture. Post-operative exercises included passive flexion and extension without external fixation on the next day of surgery. Average follow-up observation period was 18 months. As results, the Strickland method of assessment for surgical outcome showed excellent in eight digits and good in five digits, though there was a poor outcome in one digit. Our suture method enabled early post-operative mobilisation exercise without using a splint, while preventing adhesion between the repaired tendon and peripheral tissues, which is considered to provide far greater ultimate tensile strength and a smaller gap at the sutured site than by the conventional method.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875521","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.731727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Ultimate tensile strength","weight":0.593478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.518596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Nylon","weight":0.356487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.28817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.250302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.131237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Monofilament fishing line","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monofilament_fishing_line"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Passivation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation"},{"name":"Braid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of motion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_motion"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Annular ligaments of fingers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_ligaments_of_fingers"},{"name":"United States Pharmacopeia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Pharmacopeia"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"}]}
