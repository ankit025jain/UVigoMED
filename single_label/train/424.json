{"id":424,"title":"[Which benefits for the clinician to implement MALDI-TOF/MS in the bacteriology laboratory?].","abstract":"Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) is a recent technology especially adapted to identify microbial pathogens. It has rapidly established itself as a must for most medical bacteriology laboratories. Its ease of use and speed of execution typically permit providing pathogen identification one day earlier to the clinicians. MALDI-TOF/MS facilitates identification of filamentous fungi and mycobacteria that require particular lab expertise when using conventional methods. This paper highlights the multiple advantages that MALDI-TOF/MS can bring to the physicians in their practice.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549376","annotations":[{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.809429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.515743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Mold","weight":0.494356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.375614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Hypha","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
