{"id":36528,"title":"Magnetic resonance angiography vs. angiography in tetralogy of Fallot.","abstract":": To determine whether gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography can provide a noninvasive alternative to diagnostic catheterization for evaluation of pulmonary artery anatomy in tetralogy of Fallot.Thirty-five consecutive patients with tetralogy of Fallot, who attended the cardiology outpatient department between January 2008 and December 2009, were included in the study. There were 21 males and 14 females, with a mean age of 9?Â±?4.15 years (range, 3-21 years). Thirty-two patients had tetralogy of Fallot with varying severities of valvular and infundibular stenosis. Three patients had tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. All patients underwent both cardiac catheterization with X-ray angiography and 3-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography within one month.Measurements of right and left pulmonary arteries and aortopulmonary collaterals were equal by both methods. There was a good correlation between magnetic resonance angiography and catheterization measurements of branch pulmonary arteries.Gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography can be used as a reliable noninvasive alternative to X-ray cineangiography for delineation of pulmonary arterial anatomy in sick infants and young children, obviating the need for catheterization.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570523","annotations":[{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.901907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Cardiac catheterization","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_catheterization"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.718219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.628796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.343592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.279771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Pulmonary atresia","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_atresia"},{"name":"Collateral circulation","weight":0.114162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_circulation"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Outpatient department","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_department"}]}
