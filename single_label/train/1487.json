{"id":1487,"title":"Evaluation of the level of domestic hygiene in household kitchens.","abstract":"Each year in industrialized countries, 30-40% or more cases of food poisoning occur in the household. The aims of this study are to describe the aspects related to food safety in households by carrying out a microbiological characterization of the kitchens in residential dwellings and to increase consumers' awareness concerning the importance of good hygienic practices, which are required for preventing foodborne diseases at household level.The collection of data involved taking 760 analytical samples of kitchen-counter tops and food from 80 kitchens of private dwellings; the manner in which food was treated was evaluated from the moment of purchase to its transformation and storage by means of a checklist; the questionnaire enabled us to determine the extent of consumers' knowledge concerning the food sector.Overall, the results showed a good level of hygiene concerning both food and kitchen-counter top food surfaces. The respondents of the questionnaire did not appear to be aware of various health risks especially concerning the management of the temperature and compartments of refrigerators as well as food storage times and the cooking or heating of food.The data indicate that final consumers should take more care when cleaning kitchen-counter tops and washing salad; special training programmes should be included in school curricular in order to increase citizens' awareness and knowledge concerning food risks within the household.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25405378","annotations":[{"name":"Cooking","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking"},{"name":"Food safety","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.76992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Industrialisation","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.632954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.60681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Refrigerator","weight":0.523435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.408178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Citizenship","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Salad","weight":0.270876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad"},{"name":"School","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"House","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Food storage","weight":0.195551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_storage"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Washing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing"},{"name":"Residential area","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_area"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Heater","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heater"},{"name":"Transformer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Warehouse","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Genetically modified food","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food"}]}
