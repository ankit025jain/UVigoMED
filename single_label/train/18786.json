{"id":18786,"title":"Being publicly diagnosed: a grounded theory study of Danish patients with tuberculosis.","abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease which affects people worldwide, but there is knowledge lacking about patients' experiences in low-prevalence and high-income countries.To provide a theoretical framework for the process of being diagnosed with tuberculosis in a Danish setting.A grounded theory design with field studies and qualitative interviews, following the recommendations from Glaser and Strauss.A process of being publicly diagnosed was identified, which developed during the patient's trajectory from being on the way to becoming a patient, becoming a patient with TB, and finally being in medical treatment. Before being diagnosed with TB, patients were weighing between biding their time and deciding to undergo an examination. Social pressure and feelings of social responsibility tended to affect the decision. Having undergone the examination(s), the patients were publicly diagnosed. Being publicly diagnosed meant changing social interactions and fighting to regain control.Findings offer new insight and an empirically derived basis for developing interventions aimed at reducing the burden of being diagnosed with tuberculosis and increasing the wellbeing of the patients.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766675","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.586287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.538707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.387592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.255508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Peer pressure","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Social responsibility","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_responsibility"},{"name":"Grounded theory","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Richard Strauss","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Strauss"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Field work","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_work"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"}]}
