{"id":56812,"title":"Effects and adverse events after CXL for keratoconus are independent of age: a 1-year follow-up study.","abstract":"To compare the effect, failure rate and the risks of corneal cross-linking (CXL) in keratoconus patients aged ?35 years to patients <35 years.In 141 eyes of 116 keratoconus patients we compared the changes in best phoropter-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and maximum keratometry values (Kmax) before and 12 months after CLX in patients aged ?35 years (n=34, 38 eyes) to the cohort of patients below 35 years of age.Overall, CXL significantly improved BCVA from 0.487 logMAR (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.426-0.548) by -0.197 logMAR (95% CI -0.243 to -0.150; P<0.001) and reduced Kmax from 48.96 diopter (Dpt) by -1.33 Dpt (95% CI -1.85 to -0.81: P<0.001). Age ?35 years had no effect on the changes of BCVA (-0.02 (95% CI -0.13 to 0.09); P=0.757) or Kmax (0.58 (95%CI -0.51 to 1.68); P=0.294) as compared with younger patients. In 54 patients (55 eyes, 38.5%) aged <35 years and in 18 patients (18 eyes, 47.4%) aged ?35 years, BCVA increased by ?2 Snellen lines. Failure (increase in Kmax ?1?Dpt) was observed in 17 eyes (16.5%) of patients aged <35 years and in 3 eyes (7.9%) of patients aged ?35 years during the 12-month follow-up period. Adverse outcomes (loss of ?2 Snellen lines) occurred in 4 (3.9%) eyes of patients aged <35 years and 1 (2.6%) eye of a patient aged ?35 years.Effects and adverse events of CXL treatment do not seem to differ between subjects younger or older than 35 years.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625376","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.592516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.473382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.32345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.263889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Keratometer","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratometer"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.120445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Component Library for Cross Platform","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Library_for_Cross_Platform"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0271638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"548","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/548"},{"name":"197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/197"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Failure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
