{"id":18894,"title":"[The evaluation of effectiveness of application of automated system of polymerase chain reaction to detect meticillin-resistant and meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in clinical material from trauma orthopedic patients].","abstract":"The article considers the evaluation of effectiveness of application of automated polymerase chain reaction system GeneXpert DX (\"Cepheid USA) as compared with bacteriologic method in detection of S. aureus (SA) and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) under infection of skin and soft tissues in orthopedic patients. The results of analysis of material from patients got in 2009-2011 using analyzer Vitek-2 to identify microorganisms demonstrated that separation and identification of agent was successful in 70.04% of 2153 examined samples. The representatives of genus of Staphylococcus made up 56% of strains. The percentage of MSRA consisted 29.8% of SA isolates. In 2012, the GeneXpert DX system was used to analyze 50 samples of clinical material. The analysis established full matching of results of detection of SA/MRSA in case of using this method and bacteriological analysis to detect agent. The DNA of SA was detected in 61.5% of patients in whom the application of bacteriological method was unsuccessful in separation and identification of agent. In 25% of patients DNA of MRSA was detected. This occurrence made it possible to begin corresponding therapy and to get clinical effect. The diagnostic using GeneXpert DX system took less than 1.5 hours from moment of availability of sample in laboratory. The application of polymerase chain reaction system GeneXpert DX is an effective additional method to identify SA/MRSA which does not exclude application of bacteriological analysis.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757866","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.472261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.323815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.320403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.141995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"South Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Separation process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_process"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"2150s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2150s"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cepheid variable","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable"}]}
