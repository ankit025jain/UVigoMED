{"id":86773,"title":"Discordance between train-of-four response and clinical symptoms in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","abstract":"A 47-year-old woman with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was scheduled for total thyroidectomy with cervical node dissection. During anesthetic management by total intravenous anesthesia using remifentanil, propofol, and rocuronium, train-of-four (TOF) monitoring findings were not consistent with clinical signs. Sugammadex successfully reversed shallow respiration.
