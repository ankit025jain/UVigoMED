{"id":83468,"title":"The clavicular part of the pectoralis major: a true entity of the upper limb on anatomical, phylogenetic, ontogenetic, functional and clinical bases. Case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"The pectoralis major consists of three parts: clavicular, sternocostal and abdominal. The first is usually separated from the deltoid by a deltopectoral triangular space, and often from the sternocostal part by another triangular space. The clavicular part is a new acquisition in Anthropoids, to optimize stabilization of the upper limb to the thorax thus permitting an increased limb mobility in Primates. It is synergetic with the deltoid in arm flexion and even more in adduction. This action is important in Humans, as the coracobrachialis becomes smaller in Mammals. Among non human Primates, those having cranially displaced shoulder joint show a significant clavicular origin of the pectoralis major. The clavicular origin might be necessary in flexion of the forelimb, when the humeral insertion of the muscle is on the same transverse plane as, or cranial to, the sternal manubrium. As to the blood and nerve supply, occurrence in Humans of a neuro-vascular pedicle for the clavicular part, shared with the deltoid, indicates a relatively morpho-functional independence of this part from the rest of the muscle. Under this regard, the width of the lateral pectoral nerve, which supplies the clavicular part of the muscle, may be related to a greater functional ability. Many manoeuvres for plastic and reconstructive surgery are performed by isolating the clavicular part of the pectoralis major. Indeed, this part may be considered as a true, self-standing anatomical entity. In fact, it has morphological individuality, peculiar bony attachments and functional autonomy, so that it is simply adjacent to the sternocostal part. Moreover, according to phylogenesis, this topographic relation develops secondarily, in parallel with the development of the clavicle. Therefore, it may be regarded not only as a simple part of an extrinsic muscle of the thorax, but also as an intrinsic muscle of the upper limb.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Pathological
