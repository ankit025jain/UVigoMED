{"id":66443,"title":"Alemtuzumab with corticosteroid minimization for pediatric deceased donor renal transplantation: a seven-yr experience.","abstract":"Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD52 receptors on B and T lymphocytes and is an effective induction agent in pediatric renal transplantation. We report a seven-yr experience using alemtuzumab induction and steroid-free protocol in the pediatric population as safe and effective. Twenty-one pediatric deceased donor renal transplants were performed at a single academic institution. All received induction with single-dose alemtuzumab and were maintained on a steroid-free protocol using TAC and MMF immunosuppression. There were 15 males and six females in the study whose ages ranged from one to 19 yr. The average follow-up was 32 months (range from 12 to 78.2 months and median 33.7 ± 23.7 months). All patients had immediate graft function. Graft survival was 95%, and patient survival was 100%. Mean 12 and 36 months eGFR were 63.33 ± 21.01 and 59.90 ± 15.27 mL/min/1.73m(2), respectively. Three patients developed acute T-cell-mediated rejection due to non-adherence while no recipients developed cytomegalovirus infection, PTLD, or polyoma BK viral nephropathy. Steroid avoidance with single-dose alemtuzumab induction provides adequate and safe immunosuppression in pediatric deceased donor renal transplant recipients receiving TAC and low-dose MMF maintenance therapy.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712738","annotations":[{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Alemtuzumab","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alemtuzumab"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.80334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Polyomavirus","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomavirus"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.549488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"CD52","weight":0.116131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD52"},{"name":"BK virus","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK_virus"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"}]}
