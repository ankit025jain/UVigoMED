{"id":37495,"title":"The use of adenosine in the treatment of a high-flow vein of Galen malformation in an adult.","abstract":"The treatment of high-flow vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) remains a therapeutic challenge for the neurosurgeon and the neurointerventionalist, as it is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates despite recent advances in open cranial surgery and interventional neuroradiology. A 37-year-old patient presented with a history of non-specific headaches. He had a history of heart failure since birth that was caused by an untreated VGAM. Intravenous boluses of adenosine were injected as an attempt to slow down the arteriovenous shunting of a VGAM prior to endovascular treatment. Adenosine can be a very useful adjunct in patients with extremely high arteriovenous shunting. n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) should be the embolic material of choice due to its quick polymerization and adhesive properties.
