{"id":89461,"title":"Elbow arthroplasty for distal humeral fractures.","abstract":"The treatment of comminuted, distal humeral fractures in elderly patients with osteoporotic bone is challenging. Total elbow arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty are reliable treatment options with favorable outcomes for fractures that are not amenable to open reduction and internal fixation. Total elbow arthroplasty is a reliable option for a comminuted distal humeral fracture in an elderly patient with osteoporosis and low functional demands. Longer-term studies have shown good to excellent results and a low risk of complications. Specific indications for hemiarthroplasty are evolving, but include comminuted coronal shear or low transverse fractures in patients who have higher functional demands than those that can be met by total elbow arthroplasty. Further studies with longer-term follow-ups are needed to compare the benefits of hemiarthroplasty with total elbow arthroplasty.
