{"id":37449,"title":"Fortification of corn masa flour with folic acid in the United States: an overview of the evidence.","abstract":"Corn masa flour, used to make products such as corn tortillas, is a staple food for Hispanic populations residing in the United States, particularly among Mexican Americans and Central Americans. Research has indicated that Hispanic women in the United States continue to be at a higher risk of having a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy than women of other races/ethnicities, even after the introduction of folic acid fortification of cereal grain products labeled as \"enriched.\" Corn masa flour has, therefore, been suggested as a potential food vehicle for folic acid in the United States. This paper explores the potential impact that folic acid fortification of corn masa flour could have on the Hispanic population in the United States.
