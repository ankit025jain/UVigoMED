{"id":20173,"title":"Chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing for prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection: a meta-analysis*.","abstract":"To assess the efficacy of a chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing for prevention of central venous catheter-related colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection using meta-analysis.Multiple computerized database searches supplemented by manual searches including relevant conference proceedings.Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of a chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing compared with conventional dressings for prevention of catheter colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection.Data were extracted on patient and catheter characteristics and outcomes.Nine randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Use of a chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing resulted in a reduced prevalence of catheter-related bloodstream infection (random effects relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.88, p = 0.009). The prevalence of catheter colonization was also markedly reduced in the chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing group (random effects relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.64; p < 0.001). There was significant benefit for prevention of catheter colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection, including arterial catheters used for hemodynamic monitoring. Other than in low birth weight infants, adverse effects were rare and minor.Our analysis shows that a chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing is beneficial in preventing catheter colonization and, more importantly, catheter-related bloodstream infection and warrants routine use in patients at high risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection and central venous catheter or arterial catheter colonization.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674924","annotations":[{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.87076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.662187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.654549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Arterial catheter","weight":0.643122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_catheter"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.416654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Peripheral venous catheter","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
