{"id":57485,"title":"Is thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor antigen (TAFIag) level significant in recurrent miscarriage?","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma thrombin-tat fibrinolysis inhibitor antigen (TAFIag) levels in women with recurrent miscarriage (RM) and age-matched healthy parous women as controls.A total of 80 patients were enrolled in this study. As a study group (group 1), the authors evaluated 49 RM patients who had two or more consecutive abortions with unknown etiology before 12 weeks of gestation. The remaining 31 patients (group 2) were age-matched healthy parous women with no history of miscarriage and experienced at least one live baby.Comparisons of blood TAFIag levels revealed no statistically significant difference between women with recurrent miscarriages and control group.The findings of the present study indicated that TAFIag level was not associated with recurrent miscarriages.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134296","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.785924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.690137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.635199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.394055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.375442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.0634428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Lesbian","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Habitual abortion","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_abortion"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"}]}
