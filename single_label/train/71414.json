{"id":71414,"title":"Attenuation of IFN-?-induced B7-H1 expression by 15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 via downregulation of the Jak/STAT/IRF-1 signaling pathway.","abstract":"B7-H1, which belongs to the B7 family of costimulatory molecules, is implicated in the ability of tumors to evade the host immune response. The development of evasion mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment may be responsible for poor therapeutic responses. In this manuscript, we report that the 15-deoxy-?(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) activator leads to the downregulation of the cancer-associated expression of B7-H1 in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-?) and the associated signaling cascades.The expression of B7-H1 from IFN-?-induced B16F10 melanoma cells was measured with flow cytometric analysis. The regulatory mechanisms of 15d-PGJ2 on cellular signaling pathways were examined using Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.The flow cytometric analysis revealed that the B7-H1 costimulatory molecule is significantly upregulated in B16F10 melanoma cells by stimulation with IFN-?. However, 15d-PGJ2 strongly downregulates B7-H1 expression in IFN-?-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells. Furthermore, the significant damping effect of 15d-PGJ2 on B7-H1 expression involves the inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase (Jak) and signal transducer(s) and activator(s) of transcription (STAT) and, thereby, the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) trans-activation of STAT. These effects of 15d-PGJ2 were not abrogated by the PPAR? antagonist GW9662, indicating that they occur through a PPAR?-independent mechanism.In this study, we demonstrate that 15d-PGJ2 suppresses the IFN-?-elicited expression of B7-H1 by the inhibition of IRF-1 transcription via the Jak/STAT signaling pathway through a PPAR?-independent mechanism in mouse melanoma cells.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25072357","annotations":[{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Western
