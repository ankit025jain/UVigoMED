{"id":83039,"title":"The interaction between beta-3 adrenergic receptor polymorphism and obesity to periodontal disease in community-dwelling elderly Japanese.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the association between beta-3 adrenergic receptor polymorphism and periodontal disease is modified by body weight.We enrolled 332 postmenopausal women and determined their HbA1C levels (%) and beta-3 adrenergic receptor (rs4994) genotypes. Periodontal parameters including clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured. After selecting subjects for each body mass index (BMI) level, the prevalence rate ratio (PRR) by multiple Poisson regression analysis was calculated to evaluate the relationship between periodontal disease and beta-3 adrenergic receptor polymorphism. The number of sites with CAL?6 mm was used as a dependent variable, and beta-3 adrenergic receptor genotype [categorized as Arg non-carriers (reference) or Arg carriers], age (y) and HbA1C (%) were adopted as independent variables. We converted the number of probing sites (n) to an offset variable.The PRR of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor genotype for the number of sites of CAL?6 mm showed a positive association in subjects with BMI?25.0 and increased markedly with BMI. The PRR in subjects with BMI?30 was 3.10 (p < 0.0001).This study indicates a positive association between periodontal disease and the beta-3 adrenergic receptor genotype in obese individuals.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460850","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.938849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.734551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.47011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.386133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.383255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.322924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.0984033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.0467462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"1C Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1C_Company"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Pennsylvania Railroad","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
