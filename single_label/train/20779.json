One of the key reasons for it is the stigma associated with the disease which affects the treatment seeking behaviour and hence the outcome.To assess the perceived and enacted stigma among TB patients and perceptions of other patients related to TB in Central Delhi.A cross-sectional study conducted in urban field practice area of a medical college of Delhi, using a pre-designed questionnaire containing items for assessment of stigma being faced by a TB patient in family, social life and workplace. It also contained questions pertaining to reaction of patients from general OPD to a family member who develops TB.A total of 100 patients on DOTS and 200 patients from general OPD were interviewed. There were 21 patients who reported to have delayed treatment seeking due to stigma. Nearly one third patients (n=34; 34%) noted negative changes in the behaviour of their family members towards them while 40% were isolated on being diagnosed with the disease. Out of the 36 employed TB patients, 65.5% (n=23) experienced negative change in the behaviour of their colleagues. In general OPD patients, significantly higher proportion of female patients said that they would not disclose the disease status of a family member suffering from TB to their neighbours (p<0.001).Perception of stigmatizing effect of Tuberculosis was high both amongst TB and other patients. Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) strategies are needed to address the effects of stigma like delayed treatment seeking.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640343","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.684286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"India","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.614865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.501397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.421476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Delhi","weight":0.372308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.238509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.132508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"College","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Central Delhi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Delhi"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Canary Islands","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Dojo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Outpatient department","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_department"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"}]}
