{"id":82565,"title":"Smoking and drinking as risk indicators for tooth loss in middle-aged Danes.","abstract":"To investigate tobacco and alcohol consumption as risk indicators for missing teeth in late middle-aged Danes.In all, 1,517 Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank (CAMB) participants received a clinical oral examination that included number of teeth. Information on smoking, drinking, and various covariates was obtained using self-administered, structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression (dependent variable: 6+ vs. <6 missing teeth) were used to investigate smoking and drinking in relation to missing teeth.Current smokers, persons who currently or previously smoked >15 tobacco units/day, and persons who had smoked for 27+ years had elevated mean scores of missing teeth and associated odds ratios (OR) compared with never smokers. Relative to nondrinkers, alcohol consumption was associated with reduced odds of missing 6+ teeth.Our findings suggest that smoking is positively associated, while alcoholic beverage consumption is inversely related to tooth loss in middle-aged Danes.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584260","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.710373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.64464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.491989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.438962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.264565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Copenhagen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Danes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danes"}]}
