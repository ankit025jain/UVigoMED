{"id":79312,"title":"Adult progressive sensorineural hearing loss: is preoperative imaging necessary before cochlear implantation?","abstract":"Preoperative evaluation of cochlear implant candidate includes routine imaging to identify anatomic abnormalities that may preclude or complicate implantation, such as cochlear aplasia, absent/narrowed internal auditory canals, cochlear ossificans, or significant traumatic fracture. The aim of this study is to determine if preoperative imaging is necessary in select cochlear implant candidates, thus defraying cost and ionizing radiation.Retrospective chart review.Tertiary referral facility.Adult patients with progressive sensorineural hearing loss without evidence of head trauma, meningitis, or congenital hearing loss who underwent cochlear implantation.Diagnostic and therapeutic.Preoperative radiologic abnormalities, deviation from standard cochlear implant operation.One hundred eighteen cochlear implants met inclusion criteria; 23.7% of CT scans had a documented abnormality, including chronic otitis media (14.4%), otosclerosis (4.2%), and an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (3.4%). There were 6 eventful surgeries in patients with normal documented CT scan. Events included multiple insertion attempts (3.4%), CSF leak (2.5%), and no apparent round window (2.5%). In every case, a cochlear implant was able to be placed successfully.In the appropriately selected patient, preoperative imaging is not necessary as it does not impact the cochlear implant surgery and will defray cost and ionizing radiation.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448283","annotations":[{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.921372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.721849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.718689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.552795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.519479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.495518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.276152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Otosclerosis","weight":0.118458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otosclerosis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.0445809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Aqueduct","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct"},{"name":"Enlarged vestibular aqueduct","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlarged_vestibular_aqueduct"},{"name":"Round window","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_window"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}]}
