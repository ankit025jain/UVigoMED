{"id":89505,"title":"Hypoxic preconditioning protection is eliminated in HIF-1? knockout mice subjected to neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.","abstract":"Hypoxic preconditioning (HPc) protects the neonatal brain in the setting of hypoxia-ischemia (HI). The mechanisms of protection may depend on activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1?). This study sought to clarify the role of HIF-1? after HPc and HI.To induce HPc, HIF-1? knockout and wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to hypoxia at postnatal day 6. At day 7, the mice underwent HI. Brain injury was determined by histology. HIF-1?, downstream targets, and markers of cell death were measured by western blot.HPc protected the WT brain compared with WT without HPc, but did not protect the HIF-1? knockout brain. In WT, HIF-1? increased after hypoxia and after HI, but not with HPc. The HIF-1? knockout showed no change in HIF-1? after hypoxia, HI, or HPc/HI. After HI, spectrin 145/150 was higher in HIF-1? knockout, but after HPc/HI, it was higher in WT. Lysosome-associated membrane protein was higher in WT early after HI, but not later. After HPc/HI, lysosome-associated membrane protein was higher in HIF-1? knockout.These results indicate that HIF-1? is necessary for HPc protection in the neonatal brain and may affect cell death after HI. Different death and repair mechanisms depend on the timing of HPc.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713818","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.780623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Spectrin","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrin"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.570586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.321841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.298684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Membrane protein","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein"},{"name":"Brain damage","weight":0.176682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Internal combustion engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
