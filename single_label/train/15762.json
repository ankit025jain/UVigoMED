{"id":15762,"title":"Tuberculosis in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"To evaluate the main features of TB epidemiology in 2012 in Poland and to compare with the corresponding EU data.Analysis of case- based clinical and demographic data on TB patients from Central TB Register, of data submitted by laboratories on anti-TB drug susceptibility testing results in cases notified in 2012, data from National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene on cases of tuberculosis as AIDS-defining disease, from Central Statistical Office on deaths from tuberculosis based on death certificates, data from ECDC report \"Tuberculosis Surveillance in Europe, 2014 (situation in 2012).7 542 TB cases were reported in Poland in 2012. The incidence rate was 19.6 cases per 100 000, with large variability between voivodships from 10.6 to 30.2. The mean annual decrease of TB incidence in 2008-2012 was 2.4%. 6 665 cases had no history of previous treatment; 17.3 per 100 000. The number of all notified pulmonary tuberculosis cases was 7 018; 18.2 per 100 000. The proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis among all registered cases was 6.9% (524 cases). In 2012, 36 patients had fibrous-cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis (0.5% of all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis). TB was diagnosed in 95 children (1.3% of all cases, incidence 1.6). The incidence of tuberculosis increased progressively with age to 34.8 among patients 65 years old and older. The mean age of new TB cases was 53.1 years. The incidence among men (27.4) was more than two times higher than among women (12.2). The incidence rate in rural population was lower than in urban; 20.2 vs. 18.6. Bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary cases (4870) constituted 69,4% of all pulmonary TB cases. The number of smear positive pulmonary TB cases was 2 778 (39.6% of all pulmonary cases). In 2012 in the all group of TB patients in Poland there were 276 (3.7%) of homeless and 1 905 (25.3%) of unemployed. There were 48 foreigners registered among all cases of tuberculosis in Poland (0.6%) and 243 cases registered among prisoners (rate 288.0). There were 31 patients with MDR-TB (0.7% of 4659 cases with known anti-TB DST results). TB was initial AIDS indicative disease in 26 cases. There were 640 deaths due to tuberculosis in 2011 (1.7 TB deaths per 100 000). Mortality among males - 2.7 - was four times higher than among females - 0.7.CONCLUSIONS. In Poland in 2012 the incidence of tuberculosis was higher than the average in EU countries. The highest incidence rates occurred in older age groups. The incidence in men was more than 2 times higher than in women. The incidence of tuberculosis in children and the percentage of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis are lower than average in EU and that is favorable for epidemiological situation of tuberculosis in our country.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
