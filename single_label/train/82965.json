{"id":82965,"title":"Recurrent metastatic spread to a percutaneous gastrostomy site in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) frequently develop dysphagia and odynophagia owing to advancing disease or as a result of medical interventions. Selected patients diagnosed with advanced HNSCC may require the insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube as part of their management. During the past 2 decades, there have been increasing reports describing tumor seeding at the PEG exit site, which have caused controversy relating to the technique used in PEG insertion. Although PEG placement is considered a safe procedure for patients with advanced head and neck cancer, the method can lead to tumor seeding, probably from direct traumatic tumor shedding. This report describes a case of tumor implantation at the PEG site in a patient with an advanced SCC of the tongue, with a review of the available literature concerning this rare condition and its possible pathogenesis.
