{"id":54367,"title":"Serum ionized magnesium in diabetic older persons.","abstract":"Several alterations of magnesium metabolism have been associated with type 2 diabetes pathophysiology, a condition particularly frequent in older persons. We aimed to evaluate serum total (Mg-tot) and serum ionized magnesium (Mg-ion) in older persons with type 2 diabetes in order to explore clinically applicable methods for the detection of magnesium deficit.Mg-tot and Mg-ion were measured in 105 fasting subjects with type 2 diabetes (mean age: 71.1±0.8 years; M/F: 45/60) and in 100 age-matched non-diabetic control persons (mean age: 72.2±0.8 years; M/F: 42/58).Mg-ion concentrations were significantly lower in diabetic persons compared with controls (0.49±0.05 mmol/L vs. 0.55±0.05 mmol/L; p<0.001). Mg-tot was also slightly but significantly lower in diabetic patients (0.82±0.007 mmol/L vs. 0.84±0.006 mmol/L; p<0.05). There was an almost complete overlap in the values of Mg-tot in older diabetic patients and controls; conversely, 44.8% of diabetic patients had Mg-ion values below 0.47 mmol/L, while none of the controls did. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and triglycerides, Mg-tot was significantly associated with FBG in all the participants (p<0.05) and Mg-ion was significantly associated with FBG in all the participants (p<0.01) and with HbA1c in diabetic participants (p<0.001).Alterations of magnesium serum concentrations are common in type 2 diabetic older adults; Mg-ion evaluation may help to identify subclinical magnesium depletion (i.e. in patients with normal Mg-tot); the close independent associations of Mg-tot and Mg-ion with FBG and with HbA1c reinforce the possible link between magnesium homeostasis and altered glucose metabolism.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462317","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.840535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.764848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.670267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.620566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.599009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Magnesium in biology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_in_biology"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"840","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/840"},{"name":"820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/820"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Midfielder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"},{"name":"Winning percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage"},{"name":"Sha Tin to Central Link","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha_Tin_to_Central_Link"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
