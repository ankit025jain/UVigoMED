{"id":83247,"title":"Measurement of salivary metabolite biomarkers for early monitoring of oral cancer with ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.","abstract":"This study aimed to set-up an ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS) method for the determination of salivary L-phenylalanine and L-leucine for early diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In addition, the diagnostic accuracy for both biomarkers was established by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Mean recoveries of l-phenylalanine and L-leucine ranged from 88.9 to 108.6% were obtained. Intra- and inter-day precision for both amino acids was less than 7%, with acceptable accuracy. Linear regression coef?cients of both biomarkers were greater than 0.99. The diagnostic accuracy for both biomarkers was established by analyzing 60 samples from apparently healthy individuals and 30 samples from OSCC patients. Both potential biomarkers demonstrated significant differences in concentrations in distinguishing OSCC from control (P<0.05). As a single biomarker, L-leucine might have better predictive power in OSCC with T1-2 (early stage of OSCC including stage I and II), and L-phenylalanine might be used for screening and diagnosis of OSCC with T3-4 (advanced stage of OSCC including stage III and IV). The combination of L-phenylalanine and L-leucine will improve the sensitivity (92.3%) and specificity (91.7%) for early diagnosis of OSCC. The possibility of salivary metabolite biomarkers for OSCC diagnosis is successfully demonstrated in this study. This developed method shows advantages with non-invasive, simple, reliable, and also provides lower detection limits and excellent precision and accuracy. These non-invasive salivary biomarkers may lead to a simple clinical tool for the early diagnosis of OSCC.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401418","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.911937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.762793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.56399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.419541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.312827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.311315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.300124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Statistical power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Predictive power","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_power"}]}
