{"id":54829,"title":"[Increased expression of endothelin-1-- a novel diagnostic marker for early AMD detection?].","abstract":"The relationship between ischemic vascular disease and age-related macular degeneration may indicate the role of vascular injury as the primary insult causing functional deficits in age-related macular degeneration. The vasoactive factors produced by endothelial cells include endothelin-1 (ET-1), which is one of the most potent vasoconstricting peptides. In this study we sought to explore the potential role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration by measuring the concentration of ET-1 in peripheral blood of individuals diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration and evaluating its intracellular expression in peripheral blood cells, on mRNA level.Peripheral blood samples from 31 patients with diagnosed dry age-related macular degeneration and 46 patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration were collected. Forty six age- and sex-matched volunteers without age-related macular degeneration were enrolled as a control group. ET-1 plasma levels were analyzed by ELISA and intracellular expression of ET-1 in peripheral blood cells was studied by using qRT-PCR.The expression of intracellular ET-1 was significantly elevated in peripheral blood cells of both dry and wet age-related macular degeneration patients compared with the control subjects. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that ET-1 was specifically expressed in the circulating endothelial cells.We assume that damaged endothelial cells may release a variety of vasoconstricting molecules, including ET-1, leading to derangement between the endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors. Local retinal ischemia consequently develops which may promote the development of retinal degeneration in patients with age-related macular degeneration,","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137915","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.868508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.744119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.738704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.693269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.59143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.562366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.483834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.428827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.385076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.28786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.277966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.252612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.186966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.125716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.114428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
