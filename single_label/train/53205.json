{"id":53205,"title":"Salvage chemotherapy with docetaxel and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in pretreated patients with platinum- and taxane-sensitive ovarian cancer: a multicenter phase II trial of the Hellenic Oncology Research Group (HORG).","abstract":"To evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of docetaxel (DOC) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) combination in patients with platinum- and taxane-sensitive ovarian cancer.Twenty-three patients were enrolled. DOC was administered at the dose of 40 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.) and PLD at 20 mg/m(2) i.v. on days 1 and 15 in cycles of 28 days. The study was closed prematurely due to slow accrual.Seven (30.4 %) patients achieved objective response (three complete, four partial), while five (21.7 %) others experienced stable disease (overall disease control rate 52.1 %). The median progression-free survival was 4.8 months and the median overall survival 18.8 months. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in two (8.7 %) and one (4.3 %) patients, respectively. Febrile neutropenia occurred in two patients. The most common non-hematological grade 3 toxicity was hand-foot syndrome (13 % of patients). There was no treatment-related death.The combination of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and docetaxel is a well tolerated and a relatively active regimen in pretreated patients with platinum- and taxane-sensitive advanced ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531559","annotations":[{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.825349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.72001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.5743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.549876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.445965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.30165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.235866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.215637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.185466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Phase II trial","weight":0.0506195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_II_trial"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Ancient Greece","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
