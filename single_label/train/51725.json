{"id":51725,"title":"[Factors of intercellular interaction in acute ischemic stroke].","abstract":"29 patients with acute carotid and vertebrobasilar stroke caused by combination of atherosclerosis and arterial hypertension were examined, of them 8 patients were diagnosed as having type II diabetes mellitus. Clinical manifestations and blood serum levels of adhesion molecules (??) in dynamics (48 h and 21st-day) of acute ischemic stroke (IS) were estimated. Soluble AM levels were significantly elevated in patients with acute IS compared with controls. The highest levels of AM were found in IS predominantly on the 1-2 days. Levels of AM were significantly higher in patients with severe stroke. Diabetes mellitus promotes the hyperproduction of adhesion molecules. Given the role of AM in endothelian disfunction genesis and tissue damage associated with IS, they could constitute a therapeutic target for prevention of the progression neurological deficit.
