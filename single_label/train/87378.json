{"id":87378,"title":"[Effect of moxibustion on vascular endothelial cell and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in rats with cutaneous wound].","abstract":"To explore the effect and action mechanism of moxibustion on healing of cutaneous wound in rats.Twenty-four SD rats were selected and made into linear full-thickness skin injury model. With randomized digital table, rats were randomly divided into a treatment group and a model group, 12 cases in each one. Then according to treatment time, each group was again divided into a 1d group, a 3d group and a 7d group, 4 cases in each one. The moxibustion at injured skin was applied in the treatment group, 30 min per time, once a day. Hematoxylineosin (HE) staining method was adapted to measure growth status of capillary and number of vascular endothelial cell; immunohistochemical method was used to measure the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).The wound healing indices in the treatment 7d group were higher than those in the model 7d group on both the 4th day and 8th day after treatment (both P < 0.05). The number of capillary in the treatment 1d group and 3d group was higher than that in the model 1 d and 3 d groups (both 1 < 0.05). The number of capillary in the treatment 7d group was lower than that in the model 7d group (P < 0.05). The number of vascular endothelial cell in the treatment 3d group was higher than that in the model 3d group (P < 0.05). The number of vascular endothelial cell in the treatment 7d group was lower than that in the model 7d group (P < 0.05). The difference of number of vascular endothelial cell between the treatment 1d group and model 1d group was not significant (P > 0.05). Positive cells accumulated score of V EGF expression in the treatment 3d group was higher than that in the model 3d group (P < 0.05). Positive cells accumulated score of VEGF expression in the treatment 7d group was lower than that in the model 7d group (P < 0.05). The difference of positive cells accumulated score of VEGF expression between the treatment 1d group and model 1d group was not significant (P > 0.05).Moxibustion could improve the healing of skin wound in rats, which could be related with regulating vascular endothelial cell and VEGF in wound tissue at different time.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233659","annotations":[{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.920367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.689373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.608052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.426636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0244926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Stereoscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy"},{"name":"Penny (British pre-decimal coin)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
