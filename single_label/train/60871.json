{"id":60871,"title":"Intravascular natural killer cell lymphoma mimicking mycosis fungoides: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Intravascular lymphoma is a rare entity. Most cases constitute a variant of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and only 10% of the published cases are of T-cell or histiocytic origin. Even fewer cases of intravascular natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma have been reported. To date, only the intravascular lymphoma of B-cell linage is recognized as a distinct entity by the WHO Classification. Here, we report the clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular findings of a 72-year-old male patient with intravascular NK-cell lymphoma of the skin who initially presented with red skin efflorescences suspicious of mycosis fungoides. A skin biopsy revealed large cell infiltrates of NK/T-cell phenotype (CD3?, CD4, CD8, CD56, and TIA-1), which were localized strictly intravascularly and which were positive for Epstein-Barr virus nucleic acid EBER (Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA). Molecular studies revealed a germline configuration for the T-cell receptor consistent with the possibility of an NK-cell origin. At the beginning, the disease appeared to be limited to the skin with no sign of bone marrow involvement or leukemic dissemination. Chemotherapy was initiated; however, the patient subsequently developed meningiosis lymphomatosa with recurrent epileptic episodes and bone marrow infiltration with pancytopenia 7 months after primary admission. Finally, the patient passed away in a septic shock.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
