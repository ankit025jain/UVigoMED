{"id":45114,"title":"Cabozantinib suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma by a dual blockade of VEGFR2 and MET.","abstract":"MET signaling has been suggested a potential role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated with prometastasis during antiangiogenesis therapy. We investigated the potential association between MET expression and therapeutic response to sorafenib in patients with HCC. Antitumor effects of cabozantinib, a dual inhibitor of MET and VEGFR2, were examined in cultured HCC cells as well as in vivo models.Total MET and phosphorylated MET (p-MET) were measured in 29 resected HCC specimens, and correlated with response to sorafenib as postoperative adjuvant therapy. In the second set of experiments using cultured HCC cells, and mouse xenograft and metastatic models, effects of cabozantinib were examined.High level of p-MET in resected HCC specimens was associated with resistance to adjuvant sorafenib therapy. In cultured HCC cells that expressed p-MET, cabozantinib inhibited the activity of MET and its downstream effectors, leading to G1-phase arrest. Cabozantinib inhibited tumor growth in p-MET-positive and p-MET-negative HCC by decreasing angiogenesis, inhibiting proliferation, and promoting apoptosis, but it exhibited more profound efficacy in p-MET-positive HCC xenografts. Cabozantinib blocked the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulated MET pathway and inhibited the migration and invasion of the HCC cells. Notably, cabozantinib reduced the number of metastatic lesions in the lung and liver in the experimental metastatic mouse model.Patients with HCC with high level of p-MET are associated with resistance to adjuvant sorafenib treatment. The dual blockade of VEGFR2 and MET by cabozantinib has significant antitumor activities in HCC, and the activation of MET in HCC may be a promising efficacy-predicting biomarker.
