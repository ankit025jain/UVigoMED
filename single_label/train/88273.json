We were able to achieve reach to the DIPJ with the use of fascia extension and better flap survival with more perforators captured in the flap.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875500","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Posterior interosseous artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_interosseous_artery"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thumb","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Interosseous sacroiliac ligament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interosseous_sacroiliac_ligament"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Common interosseous artery","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_interosseous_artery"}]}
