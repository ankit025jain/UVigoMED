{"id":2506,"title":"[Incidence of major lower limb amputation in Geneva: twenty-one years of observation].","abstract":"Between 1990 and 2010 the incidence of major lowerlimb amputations (by definition any level of amputation above the foot) in the canton of Geneva was 10.02 per 100,000 inhabitants/ year. The analysis of various population groups revealed that the presence of diabetes increased the relative risk of amputation by a factor of 20, and age 65 years or older by a factor of 9. During this 21 years period we observed a gradual decline in the incidence of amputation and an increased age at the time of amputation, despite the increasing prevalence of diabetes and an aging population. This was a reflection on the efforts of primary and secon- dary prevention, initiated in the 1980s in which Geneva was a pioneer.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518211","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.513761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.358193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Geneva","weight":0.213034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.124295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Cantons of Switzerland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"1980","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Introspection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection"},{"name":"Settler","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Canton of Geneva","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Geneva"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"}]}
