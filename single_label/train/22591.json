{"id":22591,"title":"Role of Brevundimonas vesicularis in supporting the growth of Legionella in nutrient-poor environments.","abstract":"In 1986, we encountered the first case of Legionella micdadei pneumonia in Japan. In the follow-up study to determine the infection route of L. micdadei, we isolated Brevundimonas vesicularis from the shower hose of the patient?s home. This motivated us to explore the symbiosis between B. vesicularis and Legionella in this study. B. vesicularis type strain, B. vesicularis Kobe strain, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 type strain, and L. micdadei Kobe strain were used. B. vesicularis was inoculated into 0.01 M phosphate buffer solution containing artificial sand, and varying concentrations of glucose at 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001%. Legionella was added to the cultures after ten days of incubation, and Legionella viable counts were monitored over time. After three days of incubation, Legionella counts increased approximately twofold in flasks containing 0.001% glucose, but Legionella counts decreased in both B. vesicularis inoculated and non-inoculated flasks containing higher concentrations of glucose. The counts were significantly higher in flasks inoculated with B. vesicularis than in non-inoculated flasks throughout the experiments. Under the nutrient-poor conditions, the presence of B. vesicularis was found to aid a further increase in Legionella counts. Further research is necessary to understand the symbiotic conditions most supporting the growth of L. micdadei.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531169","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.655662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.616913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.576707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Symbiosis","weight":0.551311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.435471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.370748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Legionella","weight":0.161645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionella"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.145716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Sand","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Kobe","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe"},{"name":"Legionella pneumophila","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionella_pneumophila"},{"name":"Shower","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower"},{"name":"Laboratory flask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_flask"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Hose (tubing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hose_(tubing)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"}]}
