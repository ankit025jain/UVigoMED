{"id":81921,"title":"[Method for prevention of tissue atrophy after teeth extraction].","abstract":"Modern approach to teeth loss treatment anticipates two main goals - both functional and esthetic rehabilitation. Smile esthetic depends not only on teeth shape, size and color but also on gingival volume and position (pink esthetic). The paper describes the method of optimal tissue preservation after frontal teeth extraction including free tissue transfer in the site of extraction performed in 24 patients. Palatal free autograft was positioned to refill the defect and sutured to gingival margin. Sutured were removed in 7 days. The method proved to be efficient and may be recommended for use in in-patient oral surgery units.
