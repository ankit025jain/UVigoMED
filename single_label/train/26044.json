{"id":26044,"title":"Early Durata lead failure caused by rib-clavicular crush.","abstract":"The patented Optim coating was designed to prevent insulation abrasions on the Durata lead (St Jude Medical, St Paul, Minnesota) and avoid the problems that had afflicted its predecessor, the Riata silicone lead (St Jude Medical). We report a case of external insulation failure 8 months after implantation of a dual-coil Durata lead and consider the potential causes of the failure.
