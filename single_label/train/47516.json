{"id":47516,"title":"Dieulafoy's lesion: an overview.","abstract":"Dieulafoy's lesion accounts for 1-5.8% of cases of acute upper GI bleeding. The two largest retrospective series, both from North America, found Dieulafoy's lesion as the source of hemorrhage in 1.9% and 1.2% of all endoscopies performed for acute GI bleeding. In the prospective study of Chung et al., Dieulafoy's Lesion was found in 3.4% of all patients with acute GI bleeding referred to their unit. The Dieulafoy's Lesion accounted for up to 40% of all causes of nonvariceal upper GI bleeding not caused by gastric or duodenal ulceration or esophageal varices in the prospective study of Matsui et al. In the study of Schmulewitz and Bailli, colonic Dieulafoy's Lesion were only found in 0.09% of all colonoscopies performed for lower GI bleeding. The actual incidence of both upper and lower GI bleeding from Dieulafoy's Lesion is likely higher than estimated because the diagnosis remains difficult. Recent advances in endoscopy have led to an increased detection of Dieulafoy's lesions. Initial GI endoscopy is effective in diagnosing up to 70% of patients. Several endoscopies may be required with 6% of patients, requiring three or more to establish the diagnosis. Angiography and/or red cell scanning can be used when endoscopy fails to diagnose a doubtful case. There is no definite unique policy for the treatment of Dieulafoy's lesions. Therapeutic endoscopy remains the first line of treatment option for controlling the bleeding while angiography is considered as a valuable alternative. Surgical intervention is kept for failure cases where it should be guided by preoperative localization. The mortality rate has decreased dramatically from 80% to 8.6% in recent times due to advancement in both diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
