{"id":45326,"title":"Potential influence of intravenous lipids on the outcomes of acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"Parenteral nutrition (PN) has been associated with a higher rate of adverse outcomes compared with enteral feeding in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). However, PN may be necessary when feeding via the enteral route is poorly tolerated or impossible, and PN is recommended as a second-line nutrition therapy in AP. Intravenous (IV) lipids are commonly used as a part of PN in patients with AP. While the adverse outcomes related to the use of PN in AP have commonly been attributed to infectious complications, data suggest that the unsaturated fatty acids in the triglycerides used in IV lipids may contribute to the development of organ failure. We discuss the clinical and experimental data on this issue and the alternative lipid emulsions that are being studied.
