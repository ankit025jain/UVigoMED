{"id":11925,"title":"Distribution of cells responsive to 5-HT? receptor antagonist-induced hypophagia.","abstract":"The central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) system is well established as an important regulator of appetite and continues to remain a focus of obesity research. While much emphasis has focussed on the 5-HT(2C) receptor (5-HT(2C)R) in 5-HT's anorectic effect, pharmacological manipulation of the 5-HT? receptor (5-HT?R) also reduces appetite and body weight and may be amenable to obesity treatment. However, the neurological circuits that underlie 5-HT?R-induced hypophagia remain to be identified. Using c-fos immunoreactivity (FOS-IR) as a marker of neuronal activation, here we mapped the neuroanatomical targets activated by an anorectic dose of the 5-HT?R antagonist SB-399885 throughout the brain. Furthermore, we quantified SB-399855 activated cells within brain appetitive nuclei, the hypothalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Our results reveal that 5-HT?R antagonist-induced hypophagia is associated with significantly increased neuronal activation in two nuclei with an established role in the central control of appetite, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) and the NTS. In contrast, no changes in FOS-IR were observed between treatment groups within other hypothalamic nuclei or DRN. The data presented here provide a first insight into the neural circuitry underlying 5-HT?R antagonist-induced appetite suppression and highlight the PVH and NTS in the coordination of 5-HT?R hypophagia.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566060","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Anorectic","weight":0.892817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectic"},{"name":"Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraventricular_nucleus_of_hypothalamus"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.817748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Solitary nucleus","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_nucleus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Neuroanatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Raphe nuclei","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphe_nuclei"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.581145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.509106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Dorsal raphe nucleus","weight":0.494375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_raphe_nucleus"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.443794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.284698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.055809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Distribution (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Brain mapping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_mapping"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
