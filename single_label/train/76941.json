{"id":76941,"title":"Loss of bone strength in response to exercise-induced weight loss in obese postmenopausal women: results from a pilot study.","abstract":"Exercise-induced weight loss (WL) can lead to decreased areal bone mineral density (aBMD). It is unknown whether this translates into decreased volumetric BMD (vBMD) or bone strength. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether exercise-induced WL results in decreased vBMD and bone strength in postmenopausal women.Fourteen subjects participated in a 4-month endurance exercise WL intervention. A weight stable (WS) control group (n=10) was followed for 4 months. Proximal femur aBMD was measured by DXA. Femoral neck vBMD and estimates of bone strength (cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) and section modulus (SM)) were measured by quantitative CT.Women were 54.6±2.4 years, BMI 32.1±5.9 kg/m(2) and 54.4±2.9 years, BMI 27.9±3.6 kg/m(2) in the WL and WS groups, respectively. The WL group lost 3.0±2.6 kg which was predominately fat mass. There was a significant decrease in SMmax. Changes in CSMImax and total hip aBMD were not significant. Total hip vBMD did not decrease significantly in response to WL. There were no significant changes in the WS group.WL may lead to decreased bone strength before changes in BMD are detected. Further studies are needed to determine whether bone-targeted exercise can preserve bone strength during WL.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879027","annotations":[{"name":"Moment of inertia","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.835667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.723371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.597453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry","weight":0.535096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.531096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.487163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.468086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.447689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.446041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.435369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.404846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Inertia","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.37754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.166855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.119465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0485303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Section modulus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_modulus"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Young's modulus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Writers_to_Her_Majesty's_Signet"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Endurance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"W-League","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W-League"},{"name":"Endurance training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_training"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
