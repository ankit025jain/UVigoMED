{"id":54022,"title":"Cell therapy for type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"Cell therapy in the form of human islet transplantation has been a successful form of treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes for over 10 years, but is significantly limited by lack of suitable donor material. A replenishable supply of insulin-producing cells has the potential to address this problem; however to date success has been limited to a few preclinical studies. Two of the most promising strategies include differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells towards insulin-producing cells and transdifferentiation of acinar or other closely related cell types towards ?-cells. Here, we discuss recent progress and challenges that need to be overcome in taking cell therapy to the clinic.
