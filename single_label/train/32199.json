{"id":32199,"title":"Perventricular device closure of ventricular septal defect using a video-assisted thoracoscopic approach.","abstract":"We describe a new technique of perventricular closure of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect on a beating heart using transesophageal echocardiography guidance and video-assisted thoracoscopy. Ventricular septal defects were closed successfully, and no shunts, rhythm disorders, or valve incompetence developed during the short hospital stay. This procedure is safe and effective for selected patients. These early and mid-term results encourage further evaluation.
