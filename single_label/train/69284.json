{"id":69284,"title":"Serum levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are not predictive of prostate cancer diagnosis and aggressiveness: results from an Italian biopsy cohort.","abstract":"To explore the association between serum levels of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) and the risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa) as well as high grade disease in men undergoing prostate biopsy.Between 2006 and 2012, we prospectively enrolled 740 patients with no history of PCa undergoing prostate biopsy. Before biopsy general data of the patient DRE, PSA and BMI were recorded. The risk of detecting cancer and high grade cancer was assessed as a function of SHBG using crude and adjusted logistic regressions.Serum levels of SHBG were not associated with an increased risk of PCa or high grade disease. Age (OR 1.027 95% CI 1.003-1.052 p = 0.027), DRE (OR 3.391 95% CI 2.258-5.092 p = 0.000) and PSA (OR 1.078 95% CI 1.037-1.120 p = 0.000) were found to be independent predictors of prostate cancer risk. Age (OR 1.051 95% CI 1.009-1.095 p = 0.016), DRE (OR 2.519 95% CI 1.384-4.584 p = 0.000), BMI (OR 1.098 95% CI 1.011-1.193 p = 0.027) and PSA (OR 1.074 95% CI 1.014-1.137 p = 0.015) were found to be independent predictors of high grade disease.In our cohort of patients, serum levels of SHBG are not predictive of PCa or high grade disease. According to our experience SHBG should not be considered a biomarker in PCa diagnosis neither a marker for high grade disease.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456771","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.930781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Sex steroid","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_steroid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.752284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.740081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.702796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sex hormone-binding globulin","weight":0.505374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.469015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.45839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.217447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0907369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Rectal examination","weight":0.0369773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal_examination"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"740","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/740"},{"name":"584","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/584"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Marine regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_regression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Uncial 0141","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0141"}]}
