{"id":91242,"title":"Retinervus luffae fructus (RLF): a novel material for use in negative pressure wound therapy.","abstract":"To describe a modified negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) apparatus, made mainly of an environmentally-friendly material derived from the retinervus luffae fructus (RLF; or loofah) plant.We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with skin defects on their limbs who underwent treatment with the RLF-NPWT device from September 2012 to October 2012. The endpoint of the study was healing by secondary intention; the time (days) to endpoint was evaluated.The RLF-NPWT device was used in 16 patients. The age of the patients ranged from 15-82 years, with a mean age of 43 ± 17 years. Six patients sustained crush injuries, nine patients had open limb injuries from motor vehicle accidents and a further patient had a diabetic foot ulcer. The mean time to healing was 8.5 ± 2.4 days. Following RLF-NPWT, fresh granulation tissue was observed in all wound beds, with no evidence of macroscopical necrosis. All 16 patients in the study achieved secondary healing.The environmentally friendly RLF-NPWT apparatus is easy to use and able to provide continual negative pressure for optimal preparation of the wound bed. The cost-effectiveness of RLF-NPWT compared to standard NPWT requires further investigation.There were no external sources of funding for this study. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526084","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.520639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.427374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.328264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.274202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.258673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Motor vehicle","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"},{"name":"Negative pressure wound therapy","weight":0.0894229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_pressure_wound_therapy"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0891062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Luffa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luffa"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environmentally friendly","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"1582","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1582"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Exhibition game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Crush syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_syndrome"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Conflict of interest","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest"}]}
