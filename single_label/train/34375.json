{"id":34375,"title":"Altered cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid ? and amyloid precursor-like protein 1 peptides in Down's syndrome.","abstract":"Down's syndrome (DS) patients develop early Alzheimer's disease pathology with abundant cortical amyloid plaques, likely due to overproduction of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which subsequently leads to amyloid ? (A?) aggregation. This is reflected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the 42-amino acid long A? peptide (A?1-42), which are increased in young DS patients and decreases with age. However, it is unclear whether DS also affects other aspects of A? metabolism, including production of shorter C- and N-terminal truncated A? peptides, and production of peptides from the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1), which is related to APP, and cleaved by the same enzymatic processing machinery. APLP1-derived peptides may be surrogate markers for A?1-42 production in the brain. Here, we used hybrid immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to monitor several A? and APLP1 peptides in CSF from DS patients (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 20). CSF levels of A?1-42 and three endogenous peptides derived from APLP1 (APL1?25, APL1?27 and APL1?28) were decreased in DS compared with controls, while a specific A? peptide, A?1-28, was increased in a majority of the DS individuals. This study indicates that DS causes previously unknown specific alterations of APP and APLP1 metabolism.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740518","annotations":[{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.891569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Amyloid precursor protein","weight":0.836512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_precursor_protein"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.617127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Senile plaques","weight":0.0394773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senile_plaques"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Protein precursor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_precursor"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
