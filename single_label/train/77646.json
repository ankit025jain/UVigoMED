{"id":77646,"title":"Uptake of skin self-examination and clinical examination behavior by outdoor workers.","abstract":"This study investigated the association between outdoor work and response to a behavioral skin cancer early detection intervention among men 50 years or older. Overall, 495 men currently working in outdoor, mixed, or indoor occupations were randomized to a video-based intervention or control group. At 7 months post intervention, indoor workers reported the lowest proportion of whole-body skin self-examination (wbSSE; 20%). However, at 13 months mixed workers engaged more commonly in wbSSE (36%) compared with indoor (31%) and outdoor (32%) workers. In adjusted analysis, the uptake of early detection behaviors during the trial did not differ between men working in different settings. Outdoor workers compared with men in indoor or mixed work settings were similar in their response to an intervention encouraging uptake of secondary skin cancer prevention behaviors during this intervention trial.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499249","annotations":[{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.541068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.346193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
