{"id":79232,"title":"Polymorphisms in IL-6, IL-10, TNF-?, IFN-? and TGF-?1 genes and susceptibility to acute otitis media in early infancy.","abstract":"Genetic susceptibility has a major role in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media (AOM). In the present study, we investigated the variability of 5 cytokine genotypes as related to susceptibility and outcome of AOM in early infancy.Single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL-6 (-174 G?C), IL-10 (-592 C?A, -819 C?T and -1082 G?A), TNF-? (-308 G?A), IFN-? (+874 A?T) and TGF-?1 (codon 10 C?T; codon 25 G?C) genes were investigated and related to clinical course and outcome in 96 infants younger than 9 months with AOM.Compared with wild genotypes, IL-10 (-592, -819 and -1082) and TGF-?1 (codon 10) genotypes carrying the alternative allele were related to more AOM episodes (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001 and P = 0.002, respectively) and the need for tympanostomy tubes. Furthermore, IL-10 (-1082) and TGF-?1 (codon 10) genotypes carrying the alternative allele were related to later onset of first AOM episode than wild-type genotypes (P = 0.007 and P = 0.039, respectively). No relationship was found about AOM complications.Our findings suggest that IL-10 and TGF-?1 genotypes are related to the age of AOM onset, multiple AOM episodes and insertion of tympanostomy tubes, pointing to the involvement of anti-inflammatory cytokines in AOM during infancy.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
