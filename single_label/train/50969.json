{"id":50969,"title":"Distorted self-perceived weight status and underestimation of weight status in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2) patients' self-perception of their weight status is very critical in diabetes care. We sought to investigate perception of weight status in a sample of 200 DM 2 patients attending an outpatient clinic at a Teaching Hospital and compared it with their BMI-measured weight status, with a focus on underestimation of their weight status. Factors associated with underestimation of weight status in this sample were also explored.Using a cross-sectional design, anthropometric and clinical variables were assessed using appropriate tools. Questionnaires were used to collect socio-demographic data and self-perception of weight status. Self-perceived weight status was compared to BMI-measured weight status by cross-tabulation, Kappa statistics of agreement and ?2 for trend analysis. Both univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to identify factors associated with underestimation of weight status.The prevalence of general overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity was 32.0% (n?=?64) and 58.0% (n?=?116) respectively. Generally, 58.0% (n?=?116) of the participants had a distorted weight perceived weight status in which 77.6% (n?=?90) underestimated their weight status. Factors associated with underestimation of weight status were being overweight/obese (AOR?=?22.9, 95% CI?=?8.30-63.07, p<0.001), not married (AOR?=?3.7, 95% CI?=?1.50-9.17, p?=?0.005) and never tried to lose weight (AOR?=?6.9, 95% CI?=?2.35-19.97, p<0.001). Participants aged over 40 years and those being hyperglycaemic were not significantly associated to underestimation of weight status.We found a substantial discordance between BMI-measured and self-perceived weight status. Factors that were associated with underestimation of weight status were being; overweight/obese, not married and never tried to lose weight. Diabetes patients should be provided with information about weight guidelines.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736567","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.898663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.843004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0592868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0384911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Trend analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_analysis"},{"name":"Album-oriented rock","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Cohen's kappa","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen's_kappa"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Distortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 509","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_509"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"}]}
