{"id":86815,"title":"[Pathogenic spectrum of enteroviruses associated with hand, foot and mouth disease by a GeXP™-based multiplex reverse transcription-PCR assay in Jinan, China, 2009-2012].","abstract":"We investigated the pathogenic spectrum of enteroviruses associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Jinan, China. A total of 274 specimens with a clinical diagnosis of HFMD in Jinan from 2009 to June 2012 were used. A GenomeLab™ (GeXP)-based multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was employed to simultaneously detect 15 serotypes of human enteroviruses: human enterovirus (EV)71; coxsackievirus A (CVA)16, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10; CVB1, 3 and 5; echovirus (Echo) 6, 7, 11, 13 and 19. Results showed that all samples were enterovirus-positive, with the most common serotypes being EV71 (25.18%) and CVA16 (16.06%), followed by CVA10 (14.23%), CVA6 (7.30%), CVB1 (1.09%), Echo6 (0.73%), CVA9 (0.36%), CVB3 (0.36%) and co-infections (5.11%). CVA10 and CVA6 had the third and fourth highest prevalence of pathogens for HFMD, respec- tively. The most prevalent season for CVA10 was from April to August, with a peak in April; for CVA6 it was from April to August, with a peak in June. This is the first report of the pathogenic spectrum of en- teroviruses associated with HFMD in Jinan using the GeXP-based multiplex RT-PCR assay. These data will provide the scientific evidence for the prevention and control of epidemics, as well as therapy for HFMD patients.","date":"2015-01-07","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562968","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Enterovirus","weight":0.729802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterovirus"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.670003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Echovirus","weight":0.566667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echovirus"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.555643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Coxsackievirus","weight":0.416667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsackievirus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Hand, foot and mouth disease","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand,_foot_and_mouth_disease"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Jinan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Destination marketing organization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destination_marketing_organization"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"7.30","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.30"}]}
