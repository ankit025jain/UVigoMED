{"id":21029,"title":"[Effectiveness in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in Foz do Iguaçu, the triple-border area of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina].","abstract":"This study sought to assess the effectiveness of health services in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in Foz do Iguaçu-PR, the triple border region of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. In this epidemiologic, cross-sectional study, 101 persons with tuberculosis were interviewed in 2009 by using an instrument based on the Primary Care Assessment Tool . The analysis was based on proportions and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%) and means. Emergency units (37%) and primary health care units (26%) were the most sought units. Access to medical consultation on the same day reached 70%, but tuberculosis was suspected in less than 47% of patients; bacilloscopy was conducted in 50% of patients. We conclude that although these services provide rapid care, they do not determine the true diagnosis and lead the patient to seek specialized services. Specialty services are more effective in establishing the correct diagnosis. In the triple border region, seeking care at a primary health care unit led to extra time and more returns to the hospital for a tuberculosis diagnosis.
