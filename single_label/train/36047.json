{"id":36047,"title":"[Congenital heart diseases in pregnant women--a risk factor for fetal distress].","abstract":"The condition of fetoplacental system in pregnant women with congenital heart diseases was studied by means of ultrasound, dopplerometry, cardiotocography, by determination of estradiol, progesterone and placental lactogen in the blood of pregnant women and in the umbilical cord and by means of pathomorphologic study of the placenta. It is shown that congenital heart diseases complicated by heart failure in pregnant women--a important risk factor for fetal distress bouth in the preclinical stage of placental insufficiency (violation of the utero-placental blood flow, changes of fetoplacental hormones levels) and in conjunction with clinical signs of fetal suffering (distress and growth retardation).","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605629","annotations":[{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.688502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.644453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.638797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.636032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.633261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.579363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.567703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.214008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Placental lactogen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placental_lactogen"},{"name":"Fetal distress","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_distress"},{"name":"Cardiotocography","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotocography"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
