{"id":8460,"title":"Fc receptor is not required for inducing antibodies but plays a critical role in conferring protection after influenza M2 vaccination.","abstract":"The ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of influenza virus is considered a rational target for a universal influenza A vaccine. To better understand M2e immune-mediated protection, Fc receptor common ? chain deficient (FcR?(-/-) ) and wild-type mice were immunized with a tandem repeat of M2e presented on virus-like particles (M2e5x VLP). Levels of M2e-specific antibodies that were induced in FcR?(-/-) mice after immunization with M2e5x VLP were similar to those in wild-type mice. In addition, M2e antibodies induced in FcR?(-/-) mice were found to be equally protective as those induced in wild-type mice. However, M2e5x VLP-immunized FcR?(-/-) mice were not well protected, as shown by severe weight loss, higher lung viral titres and interleukin-6 inflammatory cytokine production upon influenza virus challenge compared with M2e5x VLP-immunized wild-type mice. Importantly, FcR?(-/-) mice that were immunized with inactivated influenza virus induced haemagglutination inhibition activity and were well protected without a significant weight loss. Interestingly, interferon-?-producing CD4 T and CD8 T cells were found to be prevalent in lungs from M2e5x VLP-immunized FcR?(-/-) mice, which appeared to be correlated with a faster recovery after infection. These results indicate that Fc receptors play a primary role in conferring M2e-specific antibody-mediated protection whereas T cells may contribute to the recovery at later stages of infection.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773389","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Fc receptor","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fc_receptor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.735428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Hemagglutination","weight":0.652992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutination"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.534273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Fragment crystallizable region","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"M2 proton channel","weight":0.159372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_proton_channel"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Ectodomain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectodomain"},{"name":"Viral matrix protein","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_matrix_protein"},{"name":"Virus-like particle","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus-like_particle"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Tandem repeat","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_repeat"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
