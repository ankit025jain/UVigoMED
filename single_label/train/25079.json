{"id":25079,"title":"Anti-thrombotic effects of ?-linolenic acid isolated from Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim seeds.","abstract":"The current study was to evaluate the anti-thrombotic effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) which was isolated and purified from Jiaomu in vivo.The seeds were crushed and subsequently subjected to saponification, acid hydrolysis, gradient freezing, urea inclusion and complexation of silver nitrate to obtain the unsaturated fatty acids. The chemical characteristics of isolated ALA were validated by 1HNMR, 13CNMR and mass spectrometry, and then the anti-thrombotic effect of ALA and its mixture with linoleic acid (1:1) were evaluated in the following experiments.The alpha-linolenic acid was isolated and purified from Jiaomu through our newly established methods. ALA and its mixture with linoleic acid can prolong the hemorrhage and coagulation time as well as enhanced the survival rate of mice subjected to collagen-adrenaline induced thrombosis. In addition, the thrombosis on A-V bypass and platelet aggregation of rats will be reduced after treated with ALA or its mixture, and the expression level of Akt and PI3K protein decreased 26% and 31%, respectively.We designed and optimized a very simple and high-yield procedure to isolate ALA and linoleic acid mixture from seeds of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim and demonstrated that such mixture can obtain a good anti-thrombotic effect through the modulation of PI3K/Akt signaling.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252789","annotations":[{"name":"Saponification","weight":0.928136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponification"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Linoleic acid","weight":0.792105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.708745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Nitrate","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.637795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.571772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.53667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.516623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.426329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Silver nitrate","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nitrate"},{"name":"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Alpha-Linolenic acid","weight":0.191298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Linolenic_acid"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.167041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.0760956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Water purification","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"}]}
