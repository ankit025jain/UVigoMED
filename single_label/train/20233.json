{"id":20233,"title":"Age-enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to increased Atg9A inhibition of STING-mediated IFN-? production during Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.","abstract":"Pneumococcal infections remain a leading cause of death in persons ? 65 y of age. Recent reports have illustrated detrimental changes in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response or unfolded protein response in aging and age-related diseases; however, the relationship between aging, the unfolded protein response, and innate immune responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae has not been fully elucidated. Our results illustrate that stimulator of IFN genes-mediated production of IFN-? during S. pneumoniae infection is decreased in aged hosts. Enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress in response to S. pneumoniae augmented inositol-requiring protein 1/X-box binding protein 1-mediated production of autophagy-related gene 9 (Atg9a). Knockdown of Atg9a or treatment with gemcitabine HCl resulted in enhanced stimulator of IFN genes-mediated production of IFN-? by aged macrophages. Consecutive treatments with gemcitabine during in vivo S. pneumoniae infection decreased morbidity and mortality in aged hosts, which was associated with decreased Atg9a expression, increased IFN-? production, and improved bacterial clearance from lung tissue. Taken together, data presented in this study provide new evidence as to why older persons are more susceptible to S. pneumoniae, and provide a possible mechanism to enhance these responses, thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality in this population.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670807","annotations":[{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.768836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Fight-or-flight response","weight":0.612532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Hydrogen chloride","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Unfolded protein response","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfolded_protein_response"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
