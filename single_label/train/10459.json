{"id":10459,"title":"t-PA acts as a cytokine to regulate lymphocyte-endothelium adhesion in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.","abstract":"In this study, the capacity for t-PA to affect T cell-brain microvascular endothelial cell adhesion by acting as a cytokine was investigated. Following the treatment of a brain-derived endothelial cell line, bEnd.3, with various concentrations of t-PA, adhesion and transwell migration assays were performed. In the presence of t-PA, enhanced adhesion of T cells to bEnd.3 cells was observed. Using western blot analysis, an increase in ICAM-1 expression was detected for both t-PA-treated bEnd.3 cells and bEnd.3 cells treated with a non-enzymatic form of t-PA. In contrast, when LRP1 was blocked using a specific antibody, upregulation of ICAM-1 was inhibited and cAMP-PKA signaling was affected. Furthermore, using an EAE mouse model, administration of t-PA was associated with an increase in ICAM-1 expression by brain endothelial cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that t-PA can induce ICAM-1 expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells, and this may promote the development of EAE.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650778","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.943294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.867771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.812631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.425522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.386427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_autoimmune_encephalomyelitis"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.299983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"LRP1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRP1"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Encephalomyelitis","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalomyelitis"}]}
