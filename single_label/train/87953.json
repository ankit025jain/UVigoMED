{"id":87953,"title":"[Clinical observation of traumatic ankle arthritis with orthopedics lotion on 60 cases].","abstract":"Observing the clinical curative effect of orthopedics lotion to treat traumatic ankle arthritis, the outpatient department of orthopedics in Guang'anmen Hospital collected 60 cases who were diagnosed as traumatic ankle arthritis. The cases who already met the inclusion criteria, were randomly divided into the treatment group (30 cases) and control group (30 cases). Thirty patients in treatment group were received fumigation treatment with orthopedics lotion; 30 patients in control group were treated by intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate. After 5 weeks treatment, the effects on the both groups would be observed and analysed. Baird-Jackson scoring system was used to assess the overall curative effect. Visual analogue scales (VAS) was used to assess analgesic effect. BJ scores of pre-treatment and post-treatment in both the treatment group and the control group were compared, P <0O. 01, significantly different; and the BJ scores after treatment of two groups were compared by paired t-test, the t value is 1. 76, there was no significant difference between two groups. Both of the treatments were effective, but there was no significant difference in overall curative effect between the two kinds of treatment. The VAS scores after treatment of two groups were compared by paired t-test, the t value was 2. 282, and there was a significant difference between two groups (P <0. 05). The analgesic effect shown in treatment group was better than the control group. The results suggest that: orthopedics lotion is a effective way to treat traumatic ankle arthritis, and it has significant effect on analgesic.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946564","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.914325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.775701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.712397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.623749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.604279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.585518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.423892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Orthopedics","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.302191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Fumigation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumigation"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Outpatient department","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_department"},{"name":"Lotion","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotion"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
