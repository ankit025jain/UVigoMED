{"id":1108,"title":"A practical approach to interpreting lower extremity noninvasive physiologic studies.","abstract":"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important manifestation of atherosclerosis, with an estimated age-adjusted prevalence of approximately 13% in people older than 50Â years. Noninvasive vascular laboratory physiologic studies are indispensable tools in the initial evaluation and workup and postintervention follow-up. In this review, we describe a practical approach to the technique, interpretation, pitfalls, and limitations of these physiologic studies. We also provide an algorithmic approach for using these studies in the initial workup of patients with suspected PAD. Noninvasive techniques that primarily provide anatomic information have not been included in this review.
