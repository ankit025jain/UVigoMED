{"id":24351,"title":"Bacterial profile and patterns of antimicrobial drug resistance in intra-abdominal infections: current experience in a teaching hospital.","abstract":"Bacterial isolates from intra-abdominal infections, in particular, peritonitis and their unpredictable antimicrobial resistance patterns, continue to be a matter of concern not only globally but regionally too.An attempt in the present study was made to study the patterns of drug resistance in bacterial isolates, especially gram negative bacilli in intra-abdominal infections (IAI) in our hospital.From 100 cases of peritonitis, identification of isolates was done as per recommended methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) testing were performed following the CLSI guidelines.A total of 133 clinical isolates were obtained, of which 108 were aerobes and 22 anaerobes. Fungal isolates were recovered in only three cases. Escherichia coli (47/108) emerged as the most predominant pathogen followed by Klebsiella spp. (27/108), while Bacteroides fragilis emerged as the predominant anaerobe (12/22). Among coliforms, 61.7% E. coli and 74.1% Klebsiella spp. were ESBL positive. A high level of resistance was observed for beta lactams, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and ertapenem. Ertapenem resistance (30-41%) seen in coliforms, appears as an important issue. Imipenem, tigecycline, and colistin were the most consistently active agents tested against ESBL producers.Drug resistance continues to be a major concern in isolates from intra-abdominal infections. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics preceded by antimicrobial resistance testing aided by early diagnosis, adequate surgical management, and knowledge of antibiotic - resistant organisms appears effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in IAI cases.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441227","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Tigecycline","weight":0.90416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigecycline"},{"name":"Bacteroides fragilis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteroides_fragilis"},{"name":"Colistin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin"},{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Ertapenem","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ertapenem"},{"name":"Amikacin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amikacin"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Gram-negative bacteria","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria"},{"name":"Bacteroides","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteroides"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.813139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.562185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.46843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.331231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.315169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.195799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Coliform bacteria","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coliform_bacteria"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Lactam","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"},{"name":"Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby-Bauer_antibiotic_testing"}]}
