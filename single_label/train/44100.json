{"id":44100,"title":"Usefulness of non-magnifying narrow-band imaging in screening of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a prospective comparative study using propensity score matching.","abstract":"The usefulness of non-magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (NBI; NM-NBI) in the screening of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) remains unclear. Here, we aimed to compare NM-NBI and chromoendoscopy with iodine staining (CE-Iodine) in terms of the diagnostic performance, and to evaluate the usefulness of NM-NBI in detecting early esophageal SCC.We prospectively enrolled 202 consecutive patients (male/female=180/22; median age, 67 years) with high-risk factors for esophageal SCC. All patients received endoscopic examination with NM-NBI and CE-Iodine to screen for early esophageal SCC or HGIN. We conducted the examinations sequentially, and calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity through a per-lesion-based analysis. A propensity score matching analysis was performed to reduce the effects of selection bias, and we compared the respective outcomes according to NM-NBI and CE-Iodine after matching.The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of NM-NBI were 77.0, 88.3, and 75.2%, respectively, and those for unstained areas by CE-Iodine were 68.0, 94.2, and 64.0, respectively. The accuracy and specificity of NM-NBI were superior to those of CE-Iodine (P=0.03 and P=0.01, respectively). However, the sensitivity did not significantly differ between NM-NBI and CE-Iodine (P=0.67). The accuracy and specificity of NM-NBI before matching were superior to those of CE-Iodine after matching (P=0.04 and P=0.03).NM-NBI was useful and reliable for the diagnosis of esophageal SCC and can be a promising screening strategy for early esophageal SCC.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751580","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.793781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.780185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.777319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.747075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.54336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Selection bias","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.317874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Narrowband","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Propensity score matching","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
