{"id":50771,"title":"Laparoscopic single-site synchronous bilateral cortex-preserving adrenalectomy using conventional trocars and instruments for large bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas.","abstract":"Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery is being adapted for widespread indications because it offers minimal invasiveness. Herein, we report a case of synchronous bilateral cortex-preserving adrenalectomy for bilateral large adrenal pheochromocytomas. We used conventional laparoscopic instruments and trocars through a single-port site. The total operative time was 110?min. There were no perioperative complications. Single-incision multiport laparoendoscopic surgery, also known as SIMPLE surgery, can be safely used for bilateral adrenalectomy. This modification holds promise with its minimally invasive nature and reduced cost.
