{"id":82154,"title":"[Pneumoparotid: a rare cause of recurrent parotid swelling].","abstract":"Pneumoparotid is a rare cause of recurrent parotid swelling. It is often fortuitous, caused by an action inducing intraoral pressure, increased or self-induced.An 8-year-old boy presented with recurrent right unilateral parotid swelling for 2 years. A CT-scan was performed, outside of the acute phase, which revealed the presence of intraparotid air bubbles.Pneumoparotitis results from air flowing back into Stensen's duct, due to an anatomical abnormality and a significant increase of intraoral pressure. The diagnosis is made on clinical examination, often completed by a morphological examination (cervicofacial CT-scan or parotid ultrasound investigation). The outcome is most often favorable, with symptomatic treatment, and sometimes antibiotic prophylaxis. Patient education is the best means to prevent recurrence.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703198","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.784726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.701041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.616912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Patient education","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_education"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Liquid bubble","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_bubble"}]}
