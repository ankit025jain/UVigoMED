{"id":85946,"title":"The -33C/T polymorphism in the interleukin 4 gene is associated with asthma risk: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The association between the interleukin 4 (IL-4) gene -33C/T polymorphism and asthma risk is a subject of debate.We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between this polymorphism and asthma susceptibility.A systematic search of electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Weipu) was performed, and 18 studies involving 5523 cases and 5618 controls were identified. ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association.A significant association between the -33C/T polymorphism and asthma susceptibility was observed for TT vs CT + CC (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28; P=.005). In the subgroup analysis by race, a significant association was found among whites (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.14-2.57; P=.01) and Asians (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28; P=.04) but not among African Americans. In the subgroup analysis by atopic status, no significant association was found among atopic asthma patients (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.89-1.24; P=.54) or nonatopic asthma patients (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.81-1.67; P=.42). In the age-stratified analysis, an increased asthma risk was found in children (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63; P=.04) but not in adults.The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the IL-4 -33C/T polymorphism is a risk factor for asthma.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834774","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.466214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.376026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.291587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.240437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0575481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0365959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Electronic music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music"},{"name":"811","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/811"},{"name":"891","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/891"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Bibliographic database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliographic_database"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Wanfang","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanfang"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
