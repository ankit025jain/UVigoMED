{"id":16947,"title":"Potentiated anti-microsporidial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus CH1 bacteriocin using gold nanoparticles.","abstract":"Through increased awareness and improved diagnostics, microsporidiosis has now been identified in a broader range of human populations; however current therapies are inconsistently effective. Recently, probiotics were determined as means for the control of intestinal parasitic infections through their secretory products; bacteriocins. This is the first study on the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus CH1 bacteriocin, with or without gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), against intestinal microsporidiosis in immunosuppressed mice. Fecal and intestinal spore loads, besides viability, extrusion and infectivity of spores from treated animals were assessed. Results showed that the anti-microsporidial effects of bacteriocin were significantly potent. This efficiency was further potentiated upon conjugating bacteriocins with Au-NPs, as it induced a strikingly sustained reduction in fecal spore shedding after cessation of therapy by 1 week (94.26%). Furthermore, reduction in intestinal spore load was highest in bacteriocin/Au-NPs-inoculated mice (89.7%) followed by bacteriocin-inoculated group (73.5%). Spores encountered from stool of bacteriocin/Au-NPs group showed 92.4% viability, versus 93.7% in bacteriocin group. Spore extrusion and infectivity were most inhibited by exposure to bacteriocin/Au-NPs. Safety of bacteriocin/Au-NPs was also verified. Thus, considering the results of the present work, L. acidophilus CH1-derived bacteriocin can present a powerful safe therapy against intestinal microsporidiosis.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929146","annotations":[{"name":"Lactobacillus acidophilus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_acidophilus"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Spore","weight":0.83731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.590478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Bacteriocin","weight":0.445374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriocin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.355833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.296487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.159322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.132057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Moulting","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Microsporidiosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidiosis"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Infectivity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectivity"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
