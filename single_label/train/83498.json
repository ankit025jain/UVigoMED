{"id":83498,"title":"[Treatment of non-traumatic femoral head avascular necrosis by perfusion of bone marrow stromal stem cells through optional artery].","abstract":"To study the medium and long term effects of perfusion of bone marrow stromal stem cells through optional artery for the treatment of non-traumatic femoral head avascular necrosis.From January 2000 to December 2004,62 cases(78 hips) with non-traumatic femoral head necrosis accepted optional artery marrow stromal stem cells infusion treatment and had complete follow-up data, including 43 hips of 35 males and 35 hips of 27 females with an average age of 36.3 years old (22 to 54). According to preoperative imaging data, 16 hips were ARCO I stage, 52 hips were II stage, 10 hips were III a stage. Harris score was 64.94 +/- 8.12 preoperatively. Postoperative Harris score at the last follow-up, imaging changes,DSA vascular changes were analysis.The patients were followed up for 9 to 13 years (means 11 years). By the end of the follow-up, a total of 18 hips got artificial joint replacement, 10 hips of preoperative ARCO I, II period got artificial hip joint replacement, 8 hips of IIIa period got hip artificial joint replacement. Harris score was 71.21 +/- 0.19 at the end of the follow-up, it was obviously enhanced compared with preoperative. DSA showed blood vessels of supply the femoral head increased thickening.Perfusion of bone marrow stromal stem cells through optional artery can effective treat non-traumatic femoral head necrosis of ARCO I, II period, it can make the femoral circumflex artery and its branches increased thickening.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25338442","annotations":[{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.37875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.349047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Hip joint","weight":0.25813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_joint"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Circumflex branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"}]}
