{"id":14306,"title":"Compartment syndrome associated with expansile antebrachial tumors in two dogs.","abstract":"A 10-year-old spayed female Jack Russell Terrier and a 7-year-old neutered male mixed-breed dog were evaluated because of acute, progressive, unilateral forelimb lameness associated with signs of pain and turgid antebrachial swelling.For either dog, there were no salient pathological or diagnostic imaging abnormalities. A diagnosis of compartment syndrome was confirmed on the basis of high caudal antebrachial compartmental pressure in the affected forelimb.Both dogs underwent surgical exploration of the affected forelimb. In each case, an intramuscular tumor (mast cell tumor in the Jack Russell Terrier and suspected sarcoma in the mixed-breed dog) was detected and presumed to be the cause of the high compartmental pressure. At 6 months following tumor excision, the dog with the mast cell tumor did not have any clinical signs of disease. The dog with a suspected sarcoma underwent tumor excision and forelimb amputation at the proximal portion of the humerus followed by chemotherapy; the dog was euthanized approximately 1 year following treatment because of pulmonary metastasis.Compartment syndrome is a serious but rarely reported condition in dogs and is typically ascribed to intracompartmental hemorrhage. These 2 cases illustrate the potential for expansile intramuscular antebrachial tumors to cause compartment syndrome in dogs.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432967","annotations":[{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.912664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Mastocytoma","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastocytoma"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.889499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.758427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Neutering","weight":0.515183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutering"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.162983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.122318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Jack Russell Terrier","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Russell_Terrier"},{"name":"Compartment syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_syndrome"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Terrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrier"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Lameness (equine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lameness_(equine)"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Turgor pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgor_pressure"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"}]}
