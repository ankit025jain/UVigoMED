{"id":47245,"title":"Identification of isosilybin a from milk thistle seeds as an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.","abstract":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) is a key regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. Agonists of this nuclear receptor are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are also studied as a potential treatment of other metabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Silymarin, a concentrated phenolic mixture from milk thistle (Silybum marianum) seeds, is used widely as a supportive agent in the treatment of a variety of liver diseases. In this study, the PPAR? activation potential of silymarin and its main constituents was investigated. Isosilybin A (3) caused transactivation of a PPAR?-dependent luciferase reporter in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect could be reversed upon co-treatment with the PPAR? antagonist T0070907. In silico docking studies suggested a binding mode for 3 distinct from that of the inactive silymarin constituents, with one additional hydrogen bond to Ser342 in the entrance region of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor. Hence, isosilybin A (3) has been identified as the first flavonolignan PPAR? agonist, suggesting its further investigation as a modulator of this nuclear receptor.
