{"id":36810,"title":"Psychological and mental health problems in patients with thalidomide embryopathy in Japan.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to examine the presence of psychological and mental health problems in patients with thalidomide embryopathy in Japan in order to develop and build future support systems.The present study examined the presence/absence of electroencephalographic abnormalities, intellectual/cognitive functions, and mental health problems in 22 participants (nine men, 13 women) with thalidomide embryopathy. Participants completed the electroencephalograph instrument. Participants were also assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III; the Autism-Spectrum Quotient; the General Health Questionnaire-28, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.The results suggest the following: (i) electroencephalographic abnormality observed in several thalidomide embryopathy participants is unlikely to be the direct result of thalidomide; (ii) the cognitive functions of working memory and processing speed are lower in thalidomide embryopathy patients than in healthy individuals; and (iii) 40.9% of the thalidomide embryopathy participants have possible mental disorders, with more mental problems observed than in healthy individuals.Deterioration of mental health in patients with thalidomide embryopathy is indicated. Anxiety, insomnia, and physical symptoms were especially remarkable and may have resulted in restriction of social activities. Therefore, careful examination and active support of patients' psychological and mental problems is essential.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548169","annotations":[{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Working memory","weight":0.763324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.662749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.628038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.554295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Information processing","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Quotient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
