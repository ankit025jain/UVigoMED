{"id":83462,"title":"Evaluation of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide contrast agent labeling of equine cord blood and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and effects of labeling equine umbilical cord blood (UCB)- and bone marrow (BM)-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) contrast agent and the detection of labeled MSCs by use of MRI.UCB MSCs from placental tissues of 5 foals and BM MSCs from 5 horses.UCB and BM MSC cultures were seeded in duplicate (5,000 cells/cm(2)). One duplicate was incubated with SPIO (50 ?g/mL); the other was processed identically, but without SPIO. Mesenchymal stromal cells were expanded in triplicates for 5 passages and assessed for viability and proliferative capacity, labeling efficacy, and labeled cell proportion. For MRI detection, 5 Ã— 10(6) labeled BM MSCs from passage 1 or 2 were injected into a collagenase-induced superficial digital flexor tendon defect of an equine cadaveric forelimb from 2 horses.For passages 1, 2, and 3, labeling efficacy and cell proportion for UCB MSCs (99.6% [range, 98.8% to 99.9%], 16.6% [range, 6.5% to 36.1%], and 1.0% [range, 0.4% to 2.8%], respectively) were significantly higher than for BM MSCs (99.2% [range, 97.8% to 99.7%], 4.5% [range, 1.6% to 11.8%], and 0.2% [range, 0.1% to 0.6%], respectively). Labeling was not detectable after passage 3. Viability of MSCs was not affected, but cell doubling time increased in labeled MSCs, compared with that of unlabeled MSCs. On MRI 3-D T2*-weighted fast gradient echo sequences, decreased signal intensity was observed for BM passage 1 MSCs.Equine UCB and BM MSCs were labeled with SPIO at high efficiencies.","date":"2014-10-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25350092","annotations":[{"name":"Multipotent","weight":0.80702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotent"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.785237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.779985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.774425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.686872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.523605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.406117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.383031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.335712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.224409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.186427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Iron oxide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide"},{"name":"Doubling time","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_time"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Echo (phenomenon)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(phenomenon)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"MRI contrast agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_contrast_agent"},{"name":"Forelimb","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forelimb"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Equus (genus)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(genus)"}]}
