{"id":73872,"title":"[New dimensions for dendritic cells].","abstract":"Dendritic cells have turned out to be important component in the regulation of immune responses. In addition to various external structures they recognize the body's own intracellular structures and utilize them to construct information about threats affecting the well-being of organs and tissues. Dendritic cells are able to direct immune responses in a manner that among other things opens new dimensions to the prevention and management of autoimmune diseases, allergies, cancer and atherosclerosis. Vaccines directed to dendritic cells and modification of dendritic cells in vitro are becoming a part of the novel, targeted immunotherapy.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881140","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Organelle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.538352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.51388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.299239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.223263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
