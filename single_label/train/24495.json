{"id":24495,"title":"Effect of azithromycin mass drug administration for trachoma on spleen rates in Gambian children.","abstract":"To assess the effect of azithromycin mass drug administration regimens on spleen rates in children aged 0-5 years.Clinical assessment of spleen size was carried out during a cluster-randomised trial of azithromycin mass treatment for trachoma elimination in The Gambia. Twenty-four communities received three annual mass treatments with azithromycin, and 24 communities received treatment at baseline only.At the 30-month follow-up, 3646 children aged 0-5 years had spleen examination and measurement. Palpable splenomegaly was significantly lower in annually treated vs. baseline-only treatment communities and in treated vs. untreated children at 24 months in the annual treatment arm.The results suggest an effect of azithromycin on spleen rates at the individual level and are most plausibly due to the antimalarial effects of azithromycin.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433194","annotations":[{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Antimalarial medication","weight":0.175391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication"},{"name":"The Gambia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.0989124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Azithromycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"},{"name":"Trachoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachoma"},{"name":"Mass drug administration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_drug_administration"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"White pulp","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_pulp"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
