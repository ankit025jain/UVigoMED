{"id":22057,"title":"Coxiella burnetii seroprevalence and risk for humans on dairy cattle farms, the Netherlands, 2010-2011.","abstract":"Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a recognized occupational infection in persons who have regular contact with ruminants. We determined C. burnetii seroprevalence in residents living or working on dairy cattle farms with ?50 adult cows and identified risk factors for seropositivity. Serum samples from farm residents, including employees, were tested for C. burnetii IgG and IgM; seroprevalence was 72.1% overall and 87.2%, 54.5%, and 44.2% among farmers, spouses, and children, respectively. Risk factors included farm location in southern region, larger herd size, farm employment, birds in stable, contact with pigs, and indirect contact with rats or mice. Protective factors included automatic milking of cows and fully compliant use of gloves during and around calving. We recommend strengthening general biosecurity measures, such as consistent use of personal protective equipment (e.g., boots, clothing, gloves) by farm staff and avoidance of birds and vermin in stables.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572637","annotations":[{"name":"Q fever","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_fever"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.679101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Ruminant","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.62554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.623701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.569944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Dairy cattle","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle"},{"name":"Vermin","weight":0.277943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.222103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Personal protective equipment","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Milking","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milking"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Boot","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Biosecurity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Automatic milking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_milking"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Coxiella burnetii","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxiella_burnetii"},{"name":"Glove","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Pension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"}]}
