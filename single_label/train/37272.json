{"id":37272,"title":"[Infantile hemangioma and propranolol: a therapeutic \"revolution\". Literature review].","abstract":"Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common benign vascular tumour affecting children. Most infantile hemangiomas are self-limiting, but some require specific treatment. Propranolol has been proposed for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism of action of propranolol for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas and to demonstrate its safety and efficacy through a review of the literature. The non cardioselective bÃªta-blocker propranolol has been used in a pediatric setting for 40 years and, since 2008, has a new indication. A clearly significant improvement has been observed in the condition of children with complicated IH (10%) treated with propranolol. This new indication has been widely described in the international literature. Various explanations have been put forward for the mechanism of action including a vasoconstrictor, antiangiogenic and apoptotic effect of propranolol on the different cells making up an IH. Overall tolerance is good and the efficacy markedly superior to that of any other treatments used for this purpose. In conclusion, with its good tolerance profile and superior efficacy versus all the other available therapies, propranolol can be considered to be a first-line treatment for complicated IH.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505868","annotations":[{"name":"Propranolol","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.904515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.644948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.624102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.610794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Interstate 10 in Texas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_10_in_Texas"},{"name":"Capillary hemangioma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_hemangioma"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"International Harvester","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Harvester"},{"name":"Avatar (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Revolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
