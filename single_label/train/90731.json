{"id":90731,"title":"Chronic subdural haematoma associated with pre-eclampsia: case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Pre-eclampsia complicates approximately 5-8% of all pregnancies and may have adverse long-term effects on both mother and child. Chronic atraumatic subdural haematoma as a complication of severe pre-eclampsia, in the absence of clotting factor abnormalities, is a very rare condition. We present the case of a 30-year-old Moroccan woman who had a pregnancy 10 years previously, with an uneventful delivery. She presented with pre-eclampsia complicating a 29-week-old pregnancy. A few days preceding maternity unit admission the patient complained of headaches and malaise. Her blood pressure at admission was 150/120mmHg and subsequently was treated with doses of methyldopa and magnesium sulphate. Her condition worsened with a loss of consciousness 24 hours later and was transferred to the neurosurgical unit. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a left-sided subdural haematoma and the patient underwent surgery, with a good postoperative outcome. This article highlights the occurrence of neurological complications due to pre-eclampsia/eclampsia that require particular neurosurgical attention, its treatment and prognosis. We also review the literature regarding this pathology.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581892","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Methyldopa","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyldopa"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Malaise","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Magnesium sulfate","weight":0.762811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.640212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.630781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.562025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Unconsciousness","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.525029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.499803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Morocco","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco"},{"name":"Mother","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"}]}
