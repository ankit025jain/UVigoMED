{"id":2041,"title":"[Holter monitoring data in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease].","abstract":"The aim of research is to estimate the functional state of the cardiovascular system in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with the help of Holter monitoring. 117 children of school age were examined: 69 children with GERD and 48 children with chronic gastroduodenitis. All children passed esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 24-hour pH-monitoring, electrocardiography and Holter monitoring. According to Holter monitoring data it was revealed that children with GERD had increased low-frequency components of frequency domain analyses, increased number of nocturnal PVCs and increased time of enhanced dispertion periods. Holter monitoring in patients with GERD can be used to detect preclinical ectopic rhythm, to evaluate autonomic dysfunction by frequency domain analyses, to predict nocturnal symptoms.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518451","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiovascular system","weight":0.745357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.578148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Dysautonomia","weight":0.530251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.43674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.19014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.130256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Frequency domain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Virtual circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_circuit"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Holter monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holter_monitor"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"}]}
