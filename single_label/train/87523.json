{"id":87523,"title":"Cross-cultural adaptation and reliability and validity of the Dutch Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE-D).","abstract":"Lateral Epicondylalgia (LE) is a common injury for which no reliable and valid measure exists to determine severity in the Dutch language. The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) is the first questionnaire specifically designed for LE but in English. The aim of this study was to translate into Dutch and cross-culturally adapt the PRTEE and determine reliability and validity of the PRTEE-D (Dutch version).The PRTEE was cross-culturally adapted according to international guidelines. Participants (n = 122) were asked to fill out the PRTEE-D twice with a one week interval to assess test-retest reliability. Internal consistency of the PRTEE-D was determined by calculating Crohnbach's alphas for the questionnaire and subscales. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) were calculated for the overall PRTEE-D score, pain and function subscale and individual questions to determine test-retest reliability. Additionally, the Disabilities for the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores were obtained from 30 patients to assess construct validity; Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated between the PRTEE-D (subscales) and DASH and VAS-pain scores.The PRTEE was successfully cross-culturally adapted into Dutch (PRTEE-D). Crohnbach's alpha for the first assessment of the PRTEE-D was 0.98; Crohnbach's alpha was 0.93 for the pain subscale and 0.97 for the function subscale. ICC for the PRTEE-D was 0.98; subscales also showed excellent ICC values (pain scale 0.97 and function scale 0.97). A significant moderate correlation exists between PRTEE-D and DASH (0.65) and PRTEE-D and VAS pain (0.68).The PRTEE was successfully cross-culturally adapted and this study showed that the PRTEE-D is reliable and valid to obtain an indication of severity of LE. An easy-to-use instrument for practitioners is now available and this facilitates comparing Dutch and international research data.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112272","annotations":[{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.717049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Dutch language","weight":0.581101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.555767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.516713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.160927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"Tennis","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Tennis elbow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_elbow"},{"name":"Pain scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_scale"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Analog signal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Coefficients (dining club)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficients_(dining_club)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"},{"name":"Elbow (band)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_(band)"}]}
