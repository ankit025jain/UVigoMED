{"id":17683,"title":"The role of the microbiology laboratory in antimicrobial stewardship programs.","abstract":"One of the impediments to the success of antimicrobial stewardship is the lack of availability of rapid and sensitive laboratory tests. The last decade has seen an explosion in new technologies that permit, in less than 4 hours, the identification of organisms and their resistance markers. In addition, the use of biomarkers has been explored in algorithms to distinguish infections that require antimicrobial agents. Clinical microbiology laboratories also contribute to the success of stewardship programs through compilation of aggregate antimicrobial susceptibility data. This article reviews rapid diagnostics, the use of biomarkers, and antibiogram development to antimicrobial stewardship activities and the subsequent impact on patient outcomes.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857389","annotations":[{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.648904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.482717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical microbiology","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_microbiology"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Explosion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosion"},{"name":"Compiler","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Stewardship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby-Bauer_antibiotic_testing"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
