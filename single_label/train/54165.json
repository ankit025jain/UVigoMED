{"id":54165,"title":"Pheochromocytoma: a review.","abstract":"Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine producing neuroendocrine tumors that can be adrenal or extra-adrenal in origin. The classic symptoms of pheochromocytoma are headache, palpitation, anxiety and diaphoresis and the tumor can occur at any age with equal gender distribution. In patients with an established mutation or hereditary syndrome the condition may manifest at a younger age than in those with sporadic disease. Pheochromocytoma can be associated with certain genetic syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), neurofibromatosis (NF) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. Pheochromocytoma is diagnosed with biochemical confirmation of hormonal excess followed by anatomical localization (CT or MRI). The mainstay of definitive therapy is surgical resection. In this review, we discuss in detail about the symptomatology, diagnosis, genetic aspects and management of pheochromocytoma.
