{"id":89015,"title":"Left main coronary artery perforation during percutaneous coronary intervention in a patient with noninfectious aortitis.","abstract":"Noninfectious aortitis is increasingly recognized as an important cause of aortic aneurysms and dissection. Coronary involvement in noninfectious aortitis has been reported in several case reports and is marked by a high mortality. Here, we describe the case of a 72-year-old patient suffering from aortitis with involvement of the left main coronary artery trunk, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which was complicated by left coronary artery perforation. Active inflammatory disease of the vessel wall may cause excessive tissue frailty and therefore has to be considered as a risk factor for perforation during PCI.
