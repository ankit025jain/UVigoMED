{"id":71827,"title":"Enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of cytokine-induced killer cells transfected with IL3PE38KDEL gene against acute myeloid leukemia cells.","abstract":"Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, one of the feasible and effective methods of adoptive immunotherapy, have shown anti-leukemia activity in vivo and in vitro. But the strategy exhibits limited cytotoxic activity in clinical studies. In this study, CIK cells were transfected with an interleukin-3/Pseudomonas exotoxin gene (IL3PE38KDEL). RT-PCR and ELISA were used to verify the expression of IL3PE38KDEL in the transfected CIK cells. These cells released 1,186.7 Â± 149.6 pg IL3PE38KDEL/10(4) cells over 48 h into the medium and the culture supernatant selectively killed IL3 receptor(IL3R)-positive HL60 cells, but not IL3R-negative K562 cells. Moreover, IL3PE38KDEL transfection did not influence phenotypes and cytokine production of CIK cells. Co-cultured with leukemia cells, IL3PE38KDEL transfected CIK cells showed enhanced cytotoxicity against IL3R-positive HL60 cells at all effector-to-target (E:T) ratios, but exerted a basal anti-leukemia activity against IL3R-negative K562 cells. Our findings demonstrate that IL3PE38KDEL gene transfection may be a novel strategy for improving anti-leukemia activity of CIK cells.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029985","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.873304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.767485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Exotoxin","weight":0.74413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotoxin"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.573145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Interleukin 3","weight":0.364536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_3"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"HL60","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL60"},{"name":"Pseudomonas exotoxin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_exotoxin"},{"name":"K562 cells","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K562_cells"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
