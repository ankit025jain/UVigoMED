{"id":84062,"title":"[Analysis of occupational chronic n-hexane poisoning economic burden].","abstract":"To study the economic burden caused by occupational chronic n-hexane poisoning.Information about the cost of treatment, compensation, board, wage, diagnosis, escorts, transportation and the days off work were collected in a 34 cases of occupational chronic n-hexane poisoning accident to estimate the economic burden.There were 4 mild, 19 moderate, 11 severe in the 34 cases and the total cost was 6 084 809 yuan. The hospitalization days was respectively (204.0 ± 3.7) d, (226.6 ± 78.3) d and (417.6 ± 94.1) d, averaging (285.8 ± 96.3) d. The treatment cost was respectively 62 525.8, 69 409.7 and 128 155.6 yuan. The compensation was respectively 20 000.0, 20 052.6 and 30 290.9 yuan.

The days of work was respectively (176.8 ± 3.2) d, (196.4 ± 67.9) d and (361.4 ± 81.6) d, averaging (247.7 ± 83.5). The lost productivity was respectively 1 809 724.8, 2 010 350.4 and 3 699 290.4 yuan.The economic burden of occupational chronic n-hexane poisoning was so heavy that prevention measures should be strengthened.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25182822","annotations":[{"name":"Transport","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Wage","weight":0.0757863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"644","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/644"},{"name":"247","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"285","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Chinese yuan","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Total cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
