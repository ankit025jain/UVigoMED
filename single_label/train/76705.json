{"id":76705,"title":"The disposition index does not reflect ?-cell function in IGT subjects treated with pioglitazone.","abstract":"The insulin secretion/insulin resistance (IR) (disposition) index (?I/?G รท IR, where ? is change from baseline, I is insulin, and G is glucose) is commonly used as a measure of ?-cell function. This relationship is curvilinear and becomes linear when log transformed. ?I is determined by 2 variables: insulin secretion rate (ISR) and metabolic clearance of insulin. We postulated that the characteristic curvilinear relationship would be lost if ? plasma C-peptide (?CP) (instead of ? plasma insulin) was plotted against insulin sensitivity.A total of 441 individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) from ACT NOW received an oral glucose tolerance test and were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo for 2.4 years.Pioglitazone reduced IGT conversion to diabetes by 72% (P < .0001). ?I/?G vs the Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity showed the characteristic curvilinear relationship. However, when ?CP/?G or ?ISR/?G was plotted against the Matsuda index, the curvilinear relationship was completely lost. This discordance was explained by 2 distinct physiologic effects that altered plasma insulin response in opposite directions: 1) increased ISR and 2) augmented metabolic clearance of insulin. The net result was a decline in the plasma insulin response to hyperglycemia during the oral glucose tolerance test. These findings demonstrate a physiologic control mechanism wherein the increase in ISR ensures adequate insulin delivery into the portal circulation to suppress hepatic glucose production while delivering a reduced but sufficient amount of insulin to peripheral tissues to maintain the pioglitazone-mediated improvement in insulin sensitivity without excessive hyperinsulinemia.These results demonstrate the validity of the disposition index when relating the plasma insulin response to insulin sensitivity but underscore the pitfall of this index when drawing conclusions about ?-cell function, because insulin secretion declined despite an increase in the plasma insulin response.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
