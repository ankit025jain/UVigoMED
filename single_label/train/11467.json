{"id":11467,"title":"[Psoriasis: physiopathology and immunogenetics].","abstract":"Psoriasis is a multifactorial disease that involves genetic, immunological and environmental factors. During the last decade, several studies by genome scan on families or cases/controls helped to highlight more than ten loci \"PSORS\" located on different chromosomes and containing several candidate genes. Psoriasis appears as a genetic disease that follows the mixed model with the involvement of a major gene (PSORS1) and a set of minor genes with a variable penetrance depending on the locus. Genetic data have focused on the involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. It is now accepted that psoriasis is an immunological disease involving the response profiles TH1 and TH17. Much remains to be done to better elucidate the mechanisms involved in the genesis of psoriatic lesions to find new therapeutic targets.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589075","annotations":[{"name":"HLA-C","weight":0.898354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-C"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Immunogenetics","weight":0.817506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenetics"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Penetrance","weight":0.717115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.415856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"}]}
