{"id":6453,"title":"Targeting MMP-2 to treat ischemic heart injury.","abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) are long understood to be involved in remodeling of the extracellular matrix. However, over the past decade, it has become clear that one of the most ubiquitous MMPs, MMP-2, has numerous intracellular targets in cardiac myocytes. Notably, MMP-2 proteolyzes components of the sarcomere, and its intracellular activity contributes to ischemia-reperfusion injury of the heart. Together with the well documented role played by MMPs in the myocardial remodeling that occurs following myocardial infarction, this has led to great interest in targeting MMPs to treat cardiac ischemic injury. In this review we will describe the expanding understanding of intracellular MMP-2 biology, and how this knowledge may lead to improved treatments for ischemic heart injury. We also critically review the numerous preclinical studies investigating the effects of MMP inhibition in animal models of myocardial infarction and ischemia-reperfusion injury, as well as the recent clinical trials that are part of the effort to translate these results into clinical practice. Acknowledging the disappointing results of past clinical trials of MMP inhibitors for other diseases, we discuss the need for carefully designed preclinical and clinical studies to avoid mistakes that have been previously made. We conclude that inhibition of MMPs, and in particular MMP-2, shows promise as a therapy to prevent the progression from ischemic injury to heart failure. However, it is critical that the full breadth of MMP-2 biology be taken into account as such therapies are developed.
