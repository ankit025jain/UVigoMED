{"id":44351,"title":"Jun kinase-induced overexpression of leukemia-associated Rho GEF (LARG) mediates sustained hypercontraction of longitudinal smooth muscle in inflammation.","abstract":"The signaling pathways mediating sustained contraction of mouse colonic longitudinal smooth muscle and the mechanisms involved in hypercontractility of this muscle layer in response to cytokines and TNBS-induced colitis have not been fully explored. In control longitudinal smooth muscle cells, ACh acting via m3 receptors activated sequentially G?12, RhoGEF (LARG), and the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. There was abundant expression of MYPT1, minimal expression of CPI-17, and a notable absence of a PKC/CPI-17 pathway. LARG expression was increased in longitudinal muscle cells isolated from muscle strips cultured for 24 h with IL-1? or TNF-? or obtained from the colon of TNBS-treated mice. The increase in LARG expression was accompanied by a significant increase in ACh-stimulated Rho kinase and ZIP kinase activities, and sustained muscle contraction. The increase in LARG expression, Rho kinase and ZIP kinase activities, and sustained muscle contraction was abolished in cells pretreated with the Jun kinase inhibitor, SP600125. Expression of the MLCP activator, telokin, and MLCP activity were also decreased in longitudinal muscle cells from TNBS-treated mice or from strips treated with IL-1? or TNF-?. In contrast, previous studies had shown that sustained contraction in circular smooth muscle is mediated by sequential activation of G?13, p115RhoGEF, and dual RhoA-dependent pathways involving phosphorylation of MYPT1 and CPI-17. In colonic circular smooth muscle cells isolated from TNBS-treated mice or from strips treated with IL-1? or TNF-?, CPI-17 expression and sustained muscle contraction were decreased. The disparate changes in the two muscle layers contribute to intestinal dysmotility during inflammation.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740538","annotations":[{"name":"Rho-associated protein kinase","weight":0.832165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho-associated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.774734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.770497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.723117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.651115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.638055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.545297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Guanine nucleotide exchange factor","weight":0.277306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.245444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"PPP1R12A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPP1R12A"},{"name":"Rho family of GTPases","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_family_of_GTPases"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"}]}
