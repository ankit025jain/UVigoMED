{"id":19467,"title":"[Sternal osteomyelitis. Etiology, diagnostics and operative therapy concepts].","abstract":"Deep sternal infections with sternal osteomyelitis are rare conditions with extensive consequences for the patient. The incidence of complications after median sternotomy is as high as 0.4-8?%. Wound and sternal dehiscence and a septic course with mediastinitis leading to septic shock is a feared complication with a high mortality next to the chronic course of the infection with the clinical correlation of presternal fistulas. An early diagnosis and surgical intervention is decisive to enhance the prognosis of the disease, leading to a significant increase in the survival rate of patients.
