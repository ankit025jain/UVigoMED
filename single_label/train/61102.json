{"id":61102,"title":"Effect of G-CSF on induction of ENA-78 and IL-8 in the patients with malignant lymphoma.","abstract":"Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) restores neutrophil count in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. G-CSF can also induce production of epithelial neutrophil activating protein-78 (ENA-78) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), chemotactic factors from neutrophils in vitro. This study was purposed to investigate whether this effect is also observed in vivo. 10 lymphoma patients were selected who received chemotherapy and G-CSF (nartograstim) administration. Blood was obtained before chemotherapy [Time Point 1 (TP1)], at neutropenic phase before G-CSF administration (TP2), and at neutrophil recovery phase after G-CSF (TP3). ENA-78 and IL-8 mRNA in neutrophils were quantified by real-time PCR. Phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were examined by flow cytometry. The results showed that ENA-78 and IL-8 mRNA expression at TP2 increased in 5 and 8 patients, respectively. The ENA-78 mRNA expression at TP3 was increased in 3 and decreased in 6 patients, and IL-8 mRNA expression at TP3 decreased in 7 patients. G-CSF did not affect phagocytosis and normalized ROS generation in all of the patient. It is concluded that increase of ENA-78 and IL-8 expression in neutrophils is common in chemotherapy-induced neutropenic patients. G-CSF administration does not significantly increase ENA-78 and IL-8 expression.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763003","annotations":[{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.616083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.484947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.391275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.238395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"}]}
