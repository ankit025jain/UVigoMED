{"id":9297,"title":"Perspectives of a scrapie resistance breeding scheme targeting Q211, S146 and K222 caprine PRNP alleles in Greek goats.","abstract":"The present study investigates the potential use of the scrapie-protective Q211 S146 and K222 caprine PRNP alleles as targets for selective breeding in Greek goats. Genotyping data from a high number of healthy goats with special emphasis on bucks, revealed high frequencies of these alleles, while the estimated probabilities of disease occurrence in animals carrying these alleles were low, suggesting that they can be used for selection. Greek goats represent one of the largest populations in Europe. Thus, the considerations presented here are an example of the expected effect of such a scheme on scrapie occurrence and on stakeholders.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717012","annotations":[{"name":"Selective breeding","weight":0.770957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.713785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.60681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.560651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.54439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.481533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.245291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Scrapie","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapie"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0644769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"PRNP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRNP"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0239857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Bene Gesserit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit"},{"name":"Stakeholder (corporate)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"}]}
