{"id":89041,"title":"[EEG-correlates of consciousness recovery after traumatic brain injury].","abstract":"The aim of studies of patients in long-term posttraumatic unconscious state (PUS) was to outline prognostically significant EEG-markers of consciousness condition and an assessment of its dynamics orientation. We analysed outcomes of dynamic (from days to 16 years after trauma) EEG studies in 196 patients in TBI-caused PUS and different degrees of mental recovery: from chronic unconscious state up to clear consciousness. These results were compared to clinical protocols and data of MRI. It is revealed that dynamic features of EEC pattern (with the analysis of equivalent dipolar sources of separate components) allow to characterize the severity of patient's current state, to reveal the brain structures with the most expressed dysfunction, to define a zone of local cortical damage, and also the general direction of development of a traumatic illness (as though dynamics of a homeostasis of a brain). Frequency characteristics of EEG power spectrum (average frequency--an effective frequency strip) in a background and at reactions find the greatest predictive importance, especially at their assessment in 2-3 months after a trauma. The background interhemispheric EEG coherence (first of all, frontal) as the integrative characteristic of system brain activity, and its change at reactions to external incentives most reflect degree of consciousness oppression, dynamics and potential of its restoration. It was shown the high informational of the researches EEG changes to indifferent and functionally significant signs for an assessment of CNS functionality, and also of PUS pathogenesis.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761592","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain
