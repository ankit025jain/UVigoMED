{"id":76972,"title":"Treatment with bisphosphonates in severe hypercalcemia due to subcutaneous fat necrosis in an infant with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.","abstract":"Subcutaneous fat necrosis (SCFN) is a rare entity that occurs generally in term or post-term newborns exposed to perinatal stressing factors. These cutaneous lesions appear during the first weeks of life and their potential complications, such as hypercalcemia, determine the prognosis. We present a full-term newborn with SCFN lesions that appeared at the age of 12 days and who, 1 week later, developed moderate hypercalcemia. In our patient, the standard treatment was not enough to normalize calcemia and, in order to prevent secondary effects, etidronate therapy was initiated and it successfully normalized calcium levels. When SCFN is diagnosed, it is important to detect early hypercalcemia and treat it aggressively. This case provides further evidence of etidronate as an alternative and effective treatment for moderate-severe hypercalcemia.
