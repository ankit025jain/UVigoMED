{"id":54152,"title":"A cistrome roadmap for understanding pancreatic islet biology.","abstract":"Although dozens of common variants have been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), the mechanisms by which these variants increase disease susceptibility are largely unknown. A new study mapping the human pancreatic islet cistrome provides a roadmap for exploring the effects of these variants and suggests that altered enhancer function might be a common contributor to the genetic risk of T2D.
