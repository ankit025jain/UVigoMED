{"id":74033,"title":"Identification of osteosarcoma-related specific proteins in serum samples using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.","abstract":"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor. To identify OS-related specific proteins for early diagnosis of OS, a novel approach, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) to serum samples from 25 OS patients, 16 osteochondroma, and 26 age-matched normal human volunteers as controls, was performed. Two proteins showed a significantly different expression in OS serum samples from control groups. Proteomic profiles and external leave-one-out cross-validation analysis showed that the correct rate of allocation, the sensitivity, and the specificity of diagnosis were 100%. These two proteins were further identified by searching the EPO-KB database, and one of the proteins identified as Serine rich region profile is involved in various cellular signaling cascades and tumor genesis. The presence of these two proteins in OS patients but absence from premalignant and normal human controls implied that they can be potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of OS.
