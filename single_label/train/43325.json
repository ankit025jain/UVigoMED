{"id":43325,"title":"Association of interferon-? inducible protein-10 pretreatment level and sustained virological response in HCV-positive Egyptian patients.","abstract":"The response to antiviral therapy in HCV infected patients depends on several predictive factors; however, the ability to achieve sustained virological response is still limited to around 60% of the patients infected with the HCV-4 genotype. Increased serum and intrahepatic interferon -? inducible protein 10 (IP-10) levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C have been described. The aim of the work was to study the impact of pretreatment serum IP-10 level on the antiviral treatment outcome in a group of Egyptian patients infected with HCV.The study included 80 treatment naive HCV patients. Serum IP-10 levels were determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay before therapy was introduced. Serum samples were examined twice by Real-Time PCR after complete course of therapy for detection of HCV RNA; at the end of the antiviral therapy and six months later to detect sustained virological response (SVR).57 patients (71%) achieved SVR while 23 (29%) patients were non-responders (NR). Pretreatment serum IP-10 levels were significantly lower in patients who achieved SVR than in NR (p=0.000).Low pretreatment serum IP-10 is a favorable predictive of response to antiviral HCV therapy in Egyptian patients.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795055","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.707618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.514458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.338395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ancient Egypt","weight":0.2788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
