{"id":47420,"title":"Predictive factors for incidental gallbladder dysplasia and carcinoma.","abstract":"This study aims to analyze clinical characteristics and demographics of all patients admitted for cholecystectomy in a tertiary referral center to determine predictors of incidental gallbladder dysplasia (IGBD) and incidental gallbladder carcinoma (IGBC).A retrospective analyses of clinical, demographic, and histologic features of patients undergoing cholecystectomy in a single tertiary institution from 2005-2012 were performed using a logistic regression model to determine the predictors of IGBD and IGBC.Some 771 (28 conversions to open surgery [3.6%]) and 93 patients (10.7%) underwent laparoscopic and open cholecystectomies for gallstone disease, respectively. At final pathology, IGBD (low-grade [n = 10], high-grade [n = 2], mixed-grade [n = 1], and adenoma-associated [n = 5] dysplasia) was found in 18 patients (2%; median age, 45 y; interquartile range, 42.5-63.5; male-to-female ratio, 1:2; six Caucasian; and 12 Asian). IGBC was found in seven patients (0.8%; median age, 69 y; interquartile range, 69-72; one Afro-Caribbean; four Caucasian; and two Asian). Logistic regression analysis revealed Asian patients to be at a higher risk of IGBD (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-8.0; P = 0.02). Only age (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.2; P < 0.01) and polypoid lesions (OR, 37.4; 95% CI, 2.97-470.6; P = 0.01) were significantly associated with IGBC. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that age >68 y correlated positively to IGBC.IGBD and IGBC are fairly common incidental histologic finding after cholecystectomy for gallstone disease. When considering cholecystectomy, patients' demographics, in particular age and race, should always be considered as this might help the surgeon and the pathologist to institute the appropriate treatment.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589178","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.777398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.674607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.584624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.559736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.496324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.453275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.36118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.33715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.222254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0629808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"}]}
