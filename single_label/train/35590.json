{"id":35590,"title":"Atopic dermatitis.","abstract":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by intense pruritus and a waxing and waning course. AD often presents in infancy and childhood and can persist throughout adulthood. The exact cause of AD is unknown, but it likely reflects an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. AD affects up to 20% of children in the United States, and prevalence may be increasing. Treatment can be effective in alleviating symptoms but serves only to manage the disease, not cure it. Appropriate therapy can also prevent significant complications, such as infection, sleep disturbance, behavioral problems, and growth impairment.
