{"id":64002,"title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 polymorphisms and the prognosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors (FGFRs) play important roles in blood system. FGFR4 rs351855 (Gly388Arg) polymorphism has shown to be a risk factor for many diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between FGFR4 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the Chinese population. We identified two polymorphisms in the FGFR4 gene, rs351855G/A (Gly388Arg), and rs147603016G/A, by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 412 NHL cases and 476 healthy controls. Results showed that frequencies of AA genotype and A allele in rs351855 (Gly388Arg) polymorphism were significantly higher in patients than in controls (odds ratio (OR) 2.12, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1.99-3.48, P < 0.0001; OR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.21-1.88, P < 0.0001, respectively; data were adjusted for age and sex). The rs147603016G/A polymorphism did not show any correlation with NHL. When analyzing the survival time of NHL patients with FGFR4 rs351855G/A polymorphism, cases with AA genotype had significantly shorter survival time compared to the patients with GG and GA genotypes (P = 0.002). These results suggested polymorphism in FGFR4 gene was associated with increased susceptibility to NHL and could be used as a prognostic marker for this malignancy.
