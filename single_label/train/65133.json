{"id":65133,"title":"Reasons for prescription change of ?1-blockers in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.","abstract":"To investigate the reasons for prescription change of ?1-blockers in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.The ratio and interval of prescription change were assessed in 3200 patients who were eligible for the study and took 1 of 4 different ?1-blockers (doxazosin, alfuzosin, tamsulosin, or silodosin). The reasons for prescription change and evaluation of efficacy were analyzed in 444 patients whose medical records were complete.Prescription change to another ?1-blocker occurred in 694 of 3200 patients (21.7%), and the mean duration of taking their first ?1-blocker was 10.8 ± 8.2 weeks. Lack of efficacy (52.7%) was the main reason for changing ?1-blockers, followed by adverse events (33.1%), relatively high cost compared with other ?1-blockers (7.0%), inconvenience of taking drugs (4.1%), and cardiovascular comorbidity (3.2%). The mean duration of treatment according to each reason is as follows: increased adverse events: 6.3 ± 5.2 weeks, relatively high cost compared with other ?1-blockers: 8.7 ± 4.5 weeks, cardiovascular comorbidity: 10.5 ± 6.8 weeks, inconvenience of taking drugs: 10.8 ± 3.9 weeks, and lack of efficacy: 14.8 ± 6.8 weeks. The proportion of prescription change (16.3%) and prescription change because of hemodynamic adverse events (2.4%) in the silodosin group were low compared with those in the other groups (P <.05 and P <.006, respectively), but prescription change because of a ejaculation disorder was high in the silodosin group (30.1%, P <.001).Major reasons for prescription change in patients taking ?1-blockers were lack of efficacy and adverse events. In the silodosin group, the proportion of prescription change was significantly low compared with that in the other 3 groups.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972947","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.782034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Doxazosin","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxazosin"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.730883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.667554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.658307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.630688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Alfuzosin","weight":0.608235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfuzosin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.586928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.577993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.280205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.197677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Silodosin","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silodosin"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.121762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Tamsulosin","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamsulosin"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}]}
