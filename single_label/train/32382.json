{"id":32382,"title":"[Management of aortic valvular heart disease according to the 2012 guidelines].","abstract":"In 2012, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published an updated version of its guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease. Novelties include the use of advanced techniques for risk stratification and prognostic evaluation, such as stress and 3D echocardiography as well as measurement of left ventricular strain by speckle tracking. Equally important is the inclusion of percutaneous valve replacement or repair procedures, reflecting their ever-increasing use in clinical practice. Finally, the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to valvular heart disease, with collaboration of multiple specialities in a heart team has been put forward. We discuss practical aspects of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to aortic valvular disease, including an outline of the surgical indications according to the ESC guidelines.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964523","annotations":[{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.750661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.651102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.604453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.593938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.576651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.527023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.426066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.348569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.331372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"European Society of Cardiology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Society_of_Cardiology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Glossary of chess","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary approach","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_approach"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Speckle pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_pattern"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"}]}
