{"id":81566,"title":"Effect of fluoride varnishes containing tri-calcium phosphate sources on remineralization of initial primary enamel lesions.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fluoride varnishes containing tri-calcium phosphate on remineralization of primary enamel lesions. Forty-eight sound primary incisors were coated with nail varnish, leaving two 1 x 1 mm windows before being placed in a demineralizing solution for four days. After demineralization, all the specimens were coated with nail varnish over one of the windows and were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Group A: deionized water; Group B: Duraphat Fluoride Varnish; Group C: Clinpro White Varnish; Group D: TCP-fluoride varnish. Polarized light microscopy was used to evaluate initial lesion depth and after a 7-day pH cycle. Lesion depth was measured using a computerized method with the Image-Pro Plus Program. The differences in mean lesion depths were compared among the groups using the One-Way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests at a 95% confidence interval. Group A had a significant increase in lesion depth compared to the other groups. No significant differences were found among Groups B, C and D. We concluded fluoride varnishes containing tri-calcium phosphate inhibit progression of initial primary enamel lesions, and the brands tested were not significantly different from each other in efficacy.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968692","annotations":[{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.634556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Optical microscope","weight":0.441363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_microscope"},{"name":"Varnish","weight":0.393346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Purified water","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Remineralisation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remineralisation"},{"name":"Multiple comparisons","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tricalcium phosphate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricalcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Polarized light microscopy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarized_light_microscopy"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Nail polish","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_polish"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Brand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"}]}
