{"id":63717,"title":"[Expression of CD200 in the bone marrow of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and its correlations with clinical prognosis].","abstract":"To explore the expression of CD200 in the bone marrow of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and its correlations with clinical features, phenotype, chromosome type and prognosis.40 patients with CLL were tested before chemotherapy. The CD200 in the bone marrow samples were detected by the flow cytometry. The expression of CD19(+);CD200(+); was less than 50% in 18 patients, which were assigned into CD200(low) ;group, and the expression was more than or equal to 50% in 22 patients, which were in CD200(high); group.Compared with the CD200(high); group, the CD200(low) ;group had lower mean age, fewer men, lower initial WBC count, lower initial lymphocyte count, lower initial percentage of lymphocyte, lower lymph node incidence and higher initial hemoglobin(P<0.05). The average percentage of CD19(+);, CD19(+);CD23(+);, CD19(+);CD160(+); and the positive rate of Zeta chain-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70) in the CD200(low) ;group were significantly lower than those in the CD200(high); group (P<0.05). In Binet stage classification, the patients of the CD200(low) ;group were mostly in phase A, and the ones of the CD200(high); group were mostly in phase C (P<0.05). In Rai stage classification, the patients of the CD200(low) ;group were mostly in phase I, and the ones of the CD200(high); group were mostly in phase III stage (P<0.05).CD200 might be very important for the diagnosis, prognosis, individualized treatment and the longer survival time of CLL patients.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405602","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.861799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.653583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.163499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"CD23","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD23"},{"name":"ZAP70","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZAP70"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"}]}
