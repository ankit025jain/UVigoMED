{"id":30655,"title":"[Expert consensus post-marketing evaluation scheme to detect immunotoxicity of Chinese medicine in clinical populations (draft version for comments)].","abstract":"Through consensus, establish a post-marketing scheme and the technical processes to evaluate Chinese medicine's immunotoxicity on a population, as well as its beneficial influences on the immune system. Provide regulations on the collection, storage and transportation of serum samples. This article applies to the post-marketing scientific evaluation of the immunotoxicity of parenterally administered, and for other ways of taking Chinese medicine.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471307","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.323185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.277421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.188519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.181754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0990064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0783418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Conscription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"},{"name":"Warehouse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse"},{"name":"Immunotoxin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotoxin"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"}]}
