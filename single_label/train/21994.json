{"id":21994,"title":"The first cyclomegastigmane rhododendroside A from Rhododendron brachycarpum alleviates HMGB1-induced sepsis.","abstract":"Endangered plant species are a vital resource for exploring novel drug prototypes. A Korean endangered plant Rhododendron brachycarpum G. Don is a broad-leaved shrub native to northern Korea and central Japan. The high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) could be a specific target for the discovery of novel antiseptic agents.Gauge-invariant atomic orbital (GIAO) NMR chemical shift calculations were applied for investigation of stereochemical details with accuracy improved by application of DP4 analysis. In vitro antiseptic mechanisms were investigated utilizing immunofluorescence staining, ELISA and cell-cell adhesion assay. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation was employed to evaluate in vivo potential alleviating severe sepsis and septic shock.The first bicyclic megastigmane glucoside rhododendroside A (1) along with known megastigmane glucosides (2-5) were isolated from the leaves of R. brachycarpum. The structure of 1 was established by NMR analysis as well as comparison of the experimental chemical shifts with those of computed values employing DP4 application. In the CLP operation model that simulates severe sepsis, rhododendroside A (1) improved the survival rate up to 60%.Our results exhibit that R. brachycarpum may produce a unique scaffold that is developed into a drug lead mitigating HMGB1-induced vascular pro-inflammatory stimuli and thus alleviating severe sepsis and related manifestations.Discovery of new drug leads would warrant conservation efforts of endangered species.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
