{"id":61180,"title":"Determination of an appropriate cut-off value for ferritin in the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.","abstract":"Hyperferritinemia is a hallmark of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In the HLH-2004 criteria, a ferritin value >500 µg/L is considered positive. However, this level was not determined based on evidence. We compared 123 patients with HLH and 320 patients with other hyperferritinemic conditions, calculated a receiver-operating characteristic, and determined sensitivity and specificity for different values. At 2,000 µg/L a trade-off is reached with sensitivity at 70% and specificity at 68%. If familial HLH and virus-associated acquired HLH are analyzed separately, sensitivity and specificity are similar for this level. The results may guide a potential modification of the current HLH criteria.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24753034","annotations":[{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.402427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemophagocytic_lymphohistiocytosis"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"Basic-helix-loop-helix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic-helix-loop-helix"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Trade-off","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off"},{"name":"Hallmark","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
