{"id":83221,"title":"Identification of Lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to compare MALDI-TOF results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific PCR.The 87 isolates were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Microflex LT, MALDI Biotyper 3.0, Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. For the identification with species-specific PCR, oligonucleotide primers (16S rRNA) specific for L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. plantarum, and L. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. The PCR-products were separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel.For 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as L. rhamnosus, 16 as L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as L. paracasei, 3 as L. gasseri, 2 as L. plantarum, and 1 as L. casei. In 4.5% of the cases the results were discordant. Of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific PCR, 1 strain was identified by MALDI-TOF MS as L. spec. and 1 as L. parabuchneri. One strain could not be identified by either method.Both methods are highly sensitive. Limitations can be the precision of the primers (PCR) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. Additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24409673","annotations":[{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.797435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.574226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.524944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Habitat","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.261946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Agarose gel electrophoresis","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarose_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.20327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.198395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0665899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0629825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lactobacillus acidophilus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_acidophilus"},{"name":"Lactobacillus plantarum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_plantarum"},{"name":"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization"},{"name":"Lactobacillus casei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_casei"},{"name":"Bremen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen"},{"name":"Bruker","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruker"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Lieutenant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant"},{"name":"Concordant coastline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordant_coastline"},{"name":"Reference data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_data"},{"name":"Discordant","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordant"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Scarcity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
