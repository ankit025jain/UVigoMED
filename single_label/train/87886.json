{"id":87886,"title":"Pirogoff amputation for a bilateral traumatic lower-extremity amputee: indication and technique.","abstract":"Although only a small portion of all lower-extremity amputations in the United States are of traumatic origin, almost half of all living amputees have sustained traumatic amputations. This particular epidemiology is explained by the younger age, and thus longer life expectancy, of traumatic amputees. In this group especially, restoration and lifelong maintenance of ambulation and mobility is essential. The authors present the case of a bilateral traumatic lower-leg amputee whose management included a Pirogoff amputation. Although this amputation technique is not widely used, the authors believe it greatly facilitated stump and soft tissue management in this case and allowed for improved mobility. The indication for and technique of Pirogoff amputation are described, and a brief overview of amputation techniques in the foot is provided.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972429","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.333333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.217672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.15269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.0646925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"}]}
