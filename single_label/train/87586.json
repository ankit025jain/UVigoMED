{"id":87586,"title":"Pathoanatomy and incidence of the posterolateral fractures in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures: a clinical computed tomography-based measurement and the associated biomechanical model simulation.","abstract":"The aim of our study is to evaluate the incidence and pathoanatomy of posterolateral fragments and analyze the associated fracture mechanism in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures.From 1.1.2008 to 3.15.2012, all patients suffering bicondylar tibial plateau fractures were identified, scanned and analyzed at the Shanghai Clinical Trauma Center. Furthermore cadaver knees were selected into three groups of 30/60/90 knee flexion to simulate the posterolateral tibial plateau fracture by an impact device.One hundred and sixty-four (44.32 %) bicondylar tibial plateau fractures finally satisfied our requirements. Fifty-three and ninety-four cases were measured eventually in the groups of posterolateral split and depression. The posterolateral articular fragment proportion was 15.43 %. The posterolateral articular fragment angle showed an average of 12.94°. The posterolateral fragment cortical height was on average 2.96 cm. The posterolateral sagittal fragment angle averaged at 72.06°. Ninety-four cases were measured in the posterolateral depression group. The average posterolateral articular depression proportion was 16.74 %. The average posterolateral articular depression height was 2.47 cm. In the biomechanical modeling of such kinds of fracture patterns, posterolateral split fractures in 30° and 60° flexion are significantly more than those in 90° flexion. Posterolateral splits combined with anterolateral depression fractures in 30° flexion are significantly more than those in 90° flexion.The incidence of posterolateral fractures is 44.32 % in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. The morphology of posterolateral area can be referenced for the surgeon in the future clinical work. The information is also helpful for the design of locking plate and fracture modeling in biomechanical test. In addition, that posterolateral split and posterolateral depression might be caused by different injury mechanisms. Different angles of knee flexion under the axial impact loading are possibly the interpretations for these two fracture patterns.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25077782","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.759946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.715553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.601941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.590129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.434593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.33296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.217087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.187925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.139755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0909437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0831872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0539337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
