{"id":45376,"title":"Natural history of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome.","abstract":"Because of the paucity of reports and variability in the diagnostic criteria utilized, little is known regarding the natural outcome of patients with food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). Data extracted from referenced manuscripts, as well as allergists' unpublished observations from across the globe, were used to form a cohesive opinion regarding its natural outcome.All authors concur that there is a generally high rate of recovery for FPIES. The most common foods causing FPIES are milk and soy. Depending upon which study is analyzed, by the age of 3-5 years, approximately 90% of patients recover from their disease. Recovery from FPIES to solid foods, occurs at a later age, but may reflect a later stage of introduction of the food into the diet. An important clinical outcome, although not common, is a shift from FPIES food hypersensitivity to an IgE-mediated food allergy. This necessitates a change in the oral food challenge protocol, if IgE-mediated sensitization is detected.Over the past several years, there has been an increasing awareness of FPIES. This knowledge should lead to a more timely diagnosis and should reassure parents and practitioners alike regarding its favorable course.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686278","annotations":[{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.725566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.667691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.500024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.437655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Soybean","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Globe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Recovery (Eminem album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_(Eminem_album)"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
