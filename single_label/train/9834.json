{"id":9834,"title":"Gambogic acid exhibits anti-psoriatic efficacy through inhibition of angiogenesis and inflammation.","abstract":"Psoriasis is a chronic T cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease. Studies have shown that angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Studies have also indicated that Gambogic acid (GA) inhibits angiogenesis and may be a viable drug candidate in anti-angiogenesis therapies.The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-psoriatic effect of GA and the possible mechanisms.MTT test on HaCaT cells and immunofluorescence on HUVEC cells were processed. An O/W cream of GA was prepared and topically applied to the ears of K14-VEGF transgenic mice and psoriasis-like guinea-pigs, and the tail skin of Balb/C mice independently. Furthermore, hematoxylin-eosin staining of tissues from three models and immunohistochemistry staining of ear samples from K14-VEGF mice were performed.In vitro, GA inhibited proliferation of HaCaTs and TNF-?-induced activation of NF-?B in HUVECs. In vivo, animals treated with GA showed significant morphological and histological improvements. Immunohistochemical analysis of K14-VEGF transgenic mice revealed that hyperplastic and inflamed vessels were suppressed with GA treatment. The expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and E-selectin was significantly decreased. GA inhibited angiogenesis and the expression of VEGFR2 and p-VEGFR2. T lymphocyte infiltration and the expression of IL-17 and IL-22 were also reduced by GA treatment.Our results suggest that GA has anti-psoriatic efficacy through inhibition of angiogenesis and inflammation. Therefore, GA is attractive and offers future potential for application in patients with psoriasis.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal
