{"id":83923,"title":"Therapeutic interventions for frail elderly patients: part II. Ongoing and unpublished randomized trials.","abstract":"There is increasing momentum to measure frailty in clinical practice given its proven value as a predictor of outcomes, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. The number of randomized clinical trials targeting frail older adults has been modest to date. Therefore, we systematically searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry in order to review the frailty intervention trials that had been actively initiated or completed but not yet published. The interventions studied were exercise training in 2 trials, nutritional supplementation in 3 trials, combined exercise plus nutritional supplementation in 5 trials, pharmaceutical agents in 5 trials, multi-dimensional programs in 2 trials, and home-based services in 3 trials. Their respective study designs, populations, interventions, and planned outcomes are presented in this article.
