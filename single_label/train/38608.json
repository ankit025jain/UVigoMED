{"id":38608,"title":"Optimal antenatal care for twin and triplet pregnancy: the evidence base.","abstract":"Twin and triplet pregnancy is a high-risk situation, with increased risk of mortality and morbidity for both mother and babies. It is, therefore, essential that high-quality antenatal care is provided to optimise outcomes and identify and manage complications effectively. A number of additional elements of care are advised, which requires more monitoring and contact with healthcare professionals with appropriate expertise. In addition, women should be provided with accurate and relevant information and emotional support to mitigate against the anxiety and stress of these high-risk pregnancies. Early care focuses on determining chorionicity and screening for fetal complications, whereas later care concentrates on identifying and managing preterm birth, growth restriction, maternal complications, and planning for delivery. Unfortunately, the evidence base for managing these challenging pregnancies is often lacking, and a number of areas of further research is required.
