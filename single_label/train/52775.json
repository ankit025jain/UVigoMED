{"id":52775,"title":"Rapid automated diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy with in vivo corneal confocal microscopy.","abstract":"To assess the diagnostic validity of a fully automated image analysis algorithm of in vivo confocal microscopy images in quantifying corneal subbasal nerves to diagnose diabetic neuropathy.One hundred eighty-six patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1/T2DM) and 55 age-matched controls underwent assessment of neuropathy and bilateral in vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCCM). Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), branch density (CNBD), and length (CNFL) were quantified with expert, manual, and fully-automated analysis. The areas under the curve (AUC), odds ratios (OR), and optimal thresholds to rule out neuropathy were estimated for both analysis methods.Neuropathy was detected in 53% of patients with diabetes. A significant reduction in manual and automated CNBD (P < 0.001) and CNFD (P < 0.0001), and CNFL (P < 0.0001) occurred with increasing neuropathic severity. Manual and automated analysis methods were highly correlated for CNFD (r = 0.9, P < 0.0001), CNFL (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001), and CNBD (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001). Manual CNFD and automated CNFL were associated with the highest AUC, sensitivity/specificity and OR to rule out neuropathy.Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is associated with significant corneal nerve loss detected with IVCCM. Fully automated corneal nerve quantification provides an objective and reproducible means to detect human diabetic neuropathy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569580","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.809629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.784534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.721393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.560345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.488752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.401005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Nerve fiber","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.239153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0967484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"}]}
