{"id":7000,"title":"Easy access to Evans' oxazolidinones. Stereoselective synthesis and antibacterial activity of a new 2-oxazolidinone derivative.","abstract":"An interesting new approach was developed for the synthesis of Evans' chiral auxiliaries with excellent yields. In turn, another new stereoselective and efficient strategy has also allowed for the preparation of a 2-oxazolidinone derivative in 34% overall yield from the Morita-Baylis-Hillman adduct. The antibacterial activity of this oxazolidinone was tested against Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from animals with mastitis infections.
