{"id":67227,"title":"Acute kidney injury associated with rhabdomyolysis after coronary artery bypass graft: a case report and review of the literatures.","abstract":"Post-operative rhabdomyolysis is a well-known complication, especially after bariatric and orthopaedic surgeries. There are few published reports of rhabdomyolysis following cardiac surgery. Acute kidney injury had been distinguished as a serious complication of cardiac surgery. We report a case of 55-years-old male patient who developed rhabdomyolysis precipitated acute kidney injury after coronary artery bypass graft.The patient underwent urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery, with a long duration of surgery due to technical difficulty during grafting. He developed rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury necessitating hemodialysis. The patient in turn developed heart failure, which along with acute kidney injury lead to prolonged ventilation. There was supervening sepsis with prolonged intensive care unity stay and eventually prolonged hospitalization. The peak creatine kinase level was 39,000 IU/mL and peak myoglobin was 40,000 ng/ml. Reviewing the patient, surgery was prolonged due to technical difficulties encountered during grafting, leading to rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury. The pre-operative use of statins by the patient could also have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis. He developed post-operative right heart failure and sepsis. The patient's renal function gradually improved over 4 week's duration. Favorable outcome could be achieved but after prolonged course of renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis.Prolonged duration of surgery is a well-recognized risk factor in the development of rhabdomyolysis. Early recognition of rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury is important in reducing the post-operative morbidity and mortality in patients. A protocol based approach could be applied for early recognition and management.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636137","annotations":[{"name":"Rhabdomyolysis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.892916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.818697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.795466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.755978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.744201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.560309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Myoglobin","weight":0.508257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoglobin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.402715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.342362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.336814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.237113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.20368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.136135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Right heart","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_heart"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
