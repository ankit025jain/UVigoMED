{"id":90191,"title":"Risk factors for dislocation of the ulnar nerve after simple decompression for cubital tunnel syndrome.","abstract":"Anterior dislocation of the ulnar nerve is occasionally encountered after simple decompression of the nerve for treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the incidence of dislocation of the nerve following simple decompression of the nerve is correlated with the patient's preoperative characteristics and/or elbow morphology. We studied 51 patients with cubital tunnel syndrome who underwent surgery at our institution. Intraoperatively, we simulated dislocation of the nerve after simple decompression by flexing the elbow after releasing the nerve in each patient. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis showed that young age and a small ulnar nerve groove angle are positively correlated with dislocation of the nerve. Our results suggest that patients who are young and/or have a sharply angled ulnar nerve groove identified radiographically have a high probability of experiencing anterior dislocation of the ulnar nerve after simple decompression.
