{"id":73917,"title":"Neuroradiological features of papillary glioneuronal tumor: a study of 8 cases.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to characterize the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomographic (CT) findings in a series of 8 patients with papillary glioneuronal tumor (PGNT).The routine MRI (n = 8), DWI (n = 7), and CT (n = 4) of 8 PGNTs verified by pathologic examination were reviewed. The location, internal architecture, calcification, attenuation value on CT; and signal features and degree of enhancement of the lesions on MRI were evaluated.Papillary glioneuronal tumor showed relatively characteristic imaging features as well-demarcated masses with cystic degeneration, calcification, and inhomogeneous enhancement. Six of the 8 cases were located in the periventricular area. The solid part of the lesion was isointense (n = 5/8) or hypointense (n = 3/8) to gray matter on T1-weighted imaging. Diffusion-weighted imaging presented heterogeneous hypointensity and isointensity (n = 4/7) or homogeneous hypointensity (n = 3/7) in the solid part of the lesion.The location adjacent to lateral ventricle, isointensity on T1-weighted imaging, and low signal on DWI may be of some specificity to PGNT.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879457","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.713397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Grey matter","weight":0.71329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_matter"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.592511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.461316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.38029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Lateral ventricles","weight":0.334364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_ventricles"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.176959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Neuroradiology","weight":0.174872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroradiology"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.101664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Driving under the influence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Renal papilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_papilla"},{"name":"Spin-lattice relaxation time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-lattice_relaxation_time"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
