{"id":68282,"title":"Prognostic value of a cell cycle progression score for men with prostate cancer.","abstract":"A new prognostic score called the cell cycle progression or CCP score has been evaluated for predicting outcome in men with prostate cancer. The score is based on 31 cell cycle progression genes and 15 housekeeper control genes. Results on 5 cohorts have been reported. In all cases the CCP score was strongly predictive of outcome both in univariate models and in multvariate models incorporating standard factors such as Gleason grade, PSA levels and extent of disease. Two cohorts evaluated patients managed by active surveillance where the outcome was death from prostate cancer, two cohorts examined patients treated by radical prostatectomy where biochemical recurrence was the primary endpoint, and one smaller cohort looked at patients treated with radiotherapy where again biochemical recurrence was used as the endpoint. In all cases a unit change in CCP score was associated with an approximate doubling of risk of an event. These data provide strong event to support use of the CCP score to help guide clinical management.
