{"id":76035,"title":"Ameliorating effect of black tea extract on cadmium chloride-induced alteration of serum lipid profile and liver histopathology in rats.","abstract":"Cadmium is one among the most environmental pollutants that affects many organs like kidney, liver and testis. The present study was aimed to assess the simultaneous effects of black tea extracts (BTE) on cadmium chloride induced alterations in lipid profile and liver histology. Adult rats were divided into four groups (n=6/group), group I (normal saline), group II (CdCl2, 1.0 mg/kg, b.wt; i.p), group III (black tea extract, 2.5 gm tea leaf/dl of water that is 2.5% of aqueous BTE) and group IV (cadmium chloride + BTE). Cadmium chloride intoxicated rats showed significant increase in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and there is a significant decrease in the serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. In the liver, cadmium chloride showed changes in normal architecture, swollen hepatocytes, kupffer cells hyperplasia, dilation and congestion of central vein. Oral administration of black tea extracts with cadmium chloride significantly improves lipid profile and liver architecture as compared to the cadmium chloride group. The results indicate that BTE is beneficial in preventing cadmium-induced lipid alterations and hepatocellular damage.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509961","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Cadmium","weight":0.763082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.758308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.732907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Kupffer cell","weight":0.689336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupffer_cell"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.575423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.47764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.451389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tea","weight":0.37879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.263867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.235094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Black tea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tea"},{"name":"Cadmium chloride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_chloride"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"}]}
