{"id":25710,"title":"Influence of early surgical treatment on the prognosis of left-sided infective endocarditis: a multicenter cohort study.","abstract":"To analyze the influence of early valve operation on mortality in patients with left-sided infective endocarditis (IE).A multicenter cohort study was carried out between 1990 and 2010. Data from consecutive patients with definite IE and possible left-sided IE were collected. Propensity score matching and adjustment for survivor bias were used to control for confounders. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.A total of 1019 patients with a mean age of 61 years (interquartile range, 47-71 years) were included. Early surgical treatment was performed in 417 episodes (40.9%). By propensity score, we matched 316 episodes: 158 who underwent early surgical treatment and 158 who did not (medical treatment group). In-hospital mortality and late mortality were lower in the surgically treated group (26.6% vs 41.8%; absolute risk reduction [ARR], -15.2%; P=.004 and 29.7% vs 46.2%; ARR, -16.5%; P=.002, respectively). Operation was independently associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.79; P=.007). Operation was associated with reduced mortality in patients with paravalvular complications (ARR, -40.5%), severe heart failure (ARR, -32%), and native valve endocarditis (ARR, -17.8%).This study supports the benefit of surgical treatment in patients with left-sided IE carried out during the initial phase of hospitalization, especially in patients with moderate or severe heart failure and paravalvular extension of infection.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25178264","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Absolute risk reduction","weight":0.741106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_risk_reduction"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.529774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.528024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.518568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Survivorship bias","weight":0.45085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.403706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Propensity score matching","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.308922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.225773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.212874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Propensity probability","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_probability"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Infective endocarditis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infective_endocarditis"},{"name":"Indo-European languages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Matching (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(statistics)"}]}
