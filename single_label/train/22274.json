{"id":22274,"title":"Hepatitis B vaccine response among infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive women.","abstract":"Annually, an estimated 25,000 infants are born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women in the United States. Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) are recommended at birth, followed by completion of vaccine series and post-vaccination serologic testing (PVST). In a large cohort of infants born to HBsAg-positive women, factors influencing vaccine response were evaluated.Data were from HBsAg-negative infants born to HBsAg-positive women in the Enhanced Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (EPHBPP) from 2008 to 2013. Vaccine non-responders were defined as infants with antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) <10mIU/mL at PVST after receiving ?3 vaccine doses. Multivariable analyses modeled statistically significant predictor variables associated with non-response.A total of 17,951 maternal-infant pairs were enrolled; 8654 HBsAg-negative infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers received ?3 doses of vaccine with anti-HBs results. 8199 (94.7%) infants responded to a primary HepB series; 199 (94.8%) to a second series. Factors associated with anti-HBs <10mIU/mL included gestational age <37 weeks, vaccine birth dose >12h after birth, timing of final vaccine dose <6 months after birth, receipt of 3 vs. 4 vaccine doses, and PVST interval >6 months from final vaccine dose in bivariate analysis. PVST interval >6 months from final vaccine dose (OR=2.7, CI=2.0, 3.6) was significantly associated with anti-HBs <10mIU/mL; the proportion increased from 2% at 1-2 months to 21.6% at 15-16 months after the final dose. Receipt of a 4th dose improved the response rate (OR=0.5, CI=0.3, 0.8).Ninety-five percent of a large cohort of uninfected infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers in the United States responded to primary HepB vaccine series. The proportion of infants with anti-HBs <10mIU/mL increased with longer interval between the final vaccine dose and PVST. Optimal timing of PVST is within 1-2 months of final vaccine dose to avoid unnecessary revaccination.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560676","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.614257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.473684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.440396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.347521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.327143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Hepatitis B vaccine","weight":0.295147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_vaccine"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.199608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.15817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Bivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"1516","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1516"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"951","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/951"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"}]}
