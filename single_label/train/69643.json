{"id":69643,"title":"Imaging evaluation of the suprahyoid neck.","abstract":"Evaluating the complex anatomy of the suprahyoid neck on imaging studies can be a daunting task without a sound understanding of anatomy and a systematic approach. In this article, the suprahyoid neck is divided into characteristic anatomic spaces, which allow for the accurate localization of both normal structures and abnormal pathology in the neck. Once a lesion is localized to a specific suprahyoid space, imaging characteristics and clinical data can be used in a logical fashion to provide a clinically useful imaging differential diagnosis.
