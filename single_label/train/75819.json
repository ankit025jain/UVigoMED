{"id":75819,"title":"Patterns of cerebellar volume loss in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer?s disease: A VBM-DARTEL study.","abstract":"Evidence suggests that the cerebellum contributes to cognition as well as motor function. We investigated cerebellar grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) changes from magnetic resonance images in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and healthy older subjects using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Subjects (39 controls, 41 DLB, and 48 AD) underwent magnetic resonance imaging as well as clinical and cognitive assessments. VBM used SPM8 with a cerebellar brain mask to define the subspace for voxel analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using the general linear model. Relative to findings in controls, VBM analysis revealed cerebellar GM loss in lobule VI bilaterally in AD and in left Crus I and right Crus II regions in DLB. WM deficits were confined to AD in the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles. DLB demonstrates a different pattern of cerebellar GM loss which, although not significantly different from that in AD, could be an important feature in understanding the neurobiology of DLB and warrants further investigation.
