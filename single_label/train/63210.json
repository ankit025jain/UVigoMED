{"id":63210,"title":"ASXL1 but not TET2 mutations adversely impact overall survival of patients suffering systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematologic non-mast-cell diseases.","abstract":"Systemic mastocytosis with associated hematologic clonal non-mast cell disease (SM-AHNMD) is a rare and heterogeneous subtype of SM and few studies on this specific entity have been reported. Sixty two patients with Systemic mastocytosis with associated hematologic clonal non-mast cell disease (SM-AHNMD) were presented. Myeloid AHNMD was the most frequent (82%) cases. This subset of patients were older, had more cutaneous lesions, splenomegaly, liver enlargement, ascites; lower bone mineral density and hemoglobin levels and higher tryptase level than lymphoid AHNMD. Defects in KIT, TET2, ASXL1 and CBL were positive in 87%, 27%, 14%, and 11% of cases respectively. The overall survival of patients with SM-AHNMD was 85.2 months. Within the myeloid group, SM-MPN fared better than SM-MDS or SM-AML (p?=?0.044,). In univariate analysis, the presence of C-findings, the AHNMD subtypes (SM-MDS/CMML/AML versus SM-MPN/hypereosinophilia) (p?=?0.044), Neutropenia (p?=?0.015), high monocyte level (p?=?0.015) and the presence of ASXL1 mutation had detrimental effects on OS (p?=?0.007). In multivariate analysis and penalized Cox model, only the presence of ASXL1 mutation remained an independent prognostic factor that negatively affected OS (p?=?0.035). SM-AHNMD is heterogeneous with variable prognosis according to the type of the AHNMD. ASXL1 is mutated in a subset of myeloid AHNMD and adversely impact on OS.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465546","annotations":[{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.495077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mastocytosis","weight":0.438889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastocytosis"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.363482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"CD117","weight":0.259084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD117"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.255994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.140315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
