{"id":88022,"title":"Diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging for subscapularis tendon tears using radial-slice magnetic resonance images.","abstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging has low diagnostic accuracy for subscapularis tendon tears. This study investigated the utility of radial-slice magnetic resonance images for diagnosing subscapularis tendon tears.We investigated 55 shoulders in 54 patients with rotator cuff tears evident during arthroscopic shoulder surgery. The intraoperative finding of a subscapularis tendon tear was compared with the identification of a subscapularis tendon tear on preoperative radial, transverse, and oblique sagittal images using a 3.0-T system. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic images generated using different imaging methods for subscapularis tendon tears were investigated.A subscapularis tendon tear was present in 38 shoulders (69.1%). When the diagnostic accuracy of the magnetic resonance images was compared with the arthroscopic findings, the radial images had 94.7% sensitivity and 82.4% specificity, the transverse images had 57.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and the oblique sagittal images had 60.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity.Radial-slice magnetic resonance images have high sensitivity for subscapularis tendon tears and are useful for diagnosing these lesions. In particular, the sensitivity for tears in the superior part of the subscapularis tendon is higher than that of conventional methods.","date":"2014-10-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927884","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.902567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.755154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.616363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.58743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.407594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.178789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Subscapularis muscle","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscapularis_muscle"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Shoulders","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulders"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"Abdominal external oblique muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_external_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Pittsburgh Light Rail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Light_Rail"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
