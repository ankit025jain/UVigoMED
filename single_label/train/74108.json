{"id":74108,"title":"An oncogenic kinase: putting PAK5 forward.","abstract":"Overexpression of p21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5) is discovered in many tumors, probably due to its regulation in cytoskeleton, antiapoptosis and proliferation. A better understanding of the modulation mechanisms of PAK5 is needed for the development of tumor treatment where current therapeutics is inadequate.This review discusses the current understanding of PAK5 functions as an oncogenic kinase in tumor cellular regulation. Mechanisms of action and molecular pathways involved in cytoskeleton regulation, antiapoptosis and proliferation of tumors are discussed.PAKs are serine/threonine kinases and downstream effectors for Cdc42 and Rac, the subfamilies of Rho small GTPases. PAK5 shares sequence identities in p21-GTPase-binding domain and kinase domain and is completely different in other regions compared with other PAKs. Overexpression of PAK5 has been found in several tumors, probably due to its contribution to proliferation, cytoskeleton and anti-apoptosis. Additional regulation mechanisms which are independent of Rho GTPases also indicate that PAK5 functions as a special signal molecule in cellular signaling pathways of tumor progression.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24869804","annotations":[{"name":"CDC42","weight":0.885804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC42"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.879595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Rho family of GTPases","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_family_of_GTPases"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.774425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.736829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"GTPase","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTPase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Small GTPase","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_GTPase"},{"name":"Rac (GTPase)","weight":0.528224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rac_(GTPase)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.443227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Rho","weight":0.306826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.101002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
