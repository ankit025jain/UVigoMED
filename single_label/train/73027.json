{"id":73027,"title":"Quantitative assessment of the associations between CD28 T?>?C polymorphism (rs3116496) and cancer risk.","abstract":"Many studies have examined the association between CD28 T?>?C polymorphism (rs3116496) and cancer risk in various populations. However, results remained controversial. To assess this relationship more precisely, a meta-analysis was performed. A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed database for relevant articles published (updated to January 1, 2014). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. A total of nine studies were selected for this meta-analysis, including 3,878 cases and 4,424 controls. The results indicated that CD28 T?>?C polymorphism (rs3116496) was not associated with the risk of cancer in overall population (CC?+?CT vs. TT, OR?=?1.17, 95 %CI?=?0.94-1.47, P H?=?0.00; CC vs. CT?+?TT, OR?=?1.26, 95 %CI?=?0.92-1.73, P H?=?0.86; CC vs. TT, OR?=?1.27, 95 %CI?=?0.92-1.74, P H?=?0.85; CT vs. TT, OR?=?1.15, 95 %CI?=?0.91-1.46, P H?=?0.00; and C vs. T, OR?=?1.17, 95 %CI?=?0.97-1.41, P H?=?0.00). In subgroup analysis according to cancer type, no significant association was found in cervical cancer or other cancer. However, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the significant risk was found among Asians (CC?+?CT vs. TT, OR?=?1.51, 95 %CI?=?1.24-1.83, P H?=?0.05; C vs. T, OR?=?1.46, 95 %CI?=?1.22-1.74, P H?=?0.11), but not among Caucasians. The result of this meta-analysis suggested that CD28 T?>?C polymorphism (rs3116496) may have an increased risk of cancer in Asians.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927673","annotations":[{"name":"Polymorphism
