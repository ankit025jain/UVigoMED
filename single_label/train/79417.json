{"id":79417,"title":"[Experience with the application of Kombinil-Duo ear drops for the treatment of diffuse external otitis media].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment of the patients presenting with diffuse external otitis media with the application of Kombinil-Duo ear drops. The authors carried out a comparative study using Kombinil-Duo ear drops (n=30) and traditional methods (n=25). The study has demonstrated the advantages of the complication of Kombinil-Duo ear drops that allows to more rapidly eliminate such symptoms of diffuse external otitis media as otalgia, ear congestion, hyperemia, and skin infiltration in the external auditory canal.
