{"id":24558,"title":"Proximal optimization technique and kissing balloon inflations with the bioresorbable vascular scaffold for coronary bifurcation percutaneous coronary intervention.","abstract":"Proximal optimization technique and final kissing balloon inflations with noncompliant balloons facilitate success with coronary bifurcation intervention. The use of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds has been postulated to reduce the risk of in-stent restenosis, a particular problem with bifurcation intervention. We present a case of bifurcation intervention in a 49-year-old woman, using for the first time, proximal optimization and kissing balloon inflation within bioresorbable vascular scaffolds, using optical coherence tomography guidance.
