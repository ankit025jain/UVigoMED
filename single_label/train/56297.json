{"id":56297,"title":"Factors predicting duration of intraocular gas presence after 23-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.","abstract":"To investigate factors predicting duration of intraocular gas presence in 23-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy.Retrospective review of 130 eyes that underwent 23-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy. At the end of surgery, gas exchange and sclerotomy massage to promote self-sealing were performed. If sclerotomy leakage was suspected despite sclerotomy massage, a suture was placed. Factors predicting duration of intraocular gas presence in 23-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy were examined using multiple regression analysis. An F value greater than 2 and P value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Significant factors were axial length (F = 7.08; P < .05) and IOP on postoperative day 1 (F = 4.35; P < .05). Age, operation time, preoperative IOP, and number of sutured sclerotomies were not statistically significant.Factors predicting duration of intraocular gas presence in 23-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy were axial length and postoperative IOP on day 1.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708225","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.334151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.247594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0283361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.0242565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
