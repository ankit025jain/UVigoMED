{"id":54827,"title":"[Photodynamic therapy in a patient with chronic central serous chorioretinopathy--a case report].","abstract":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy as the treatment of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy.A 59-year-old man was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology and Ocular Oncology, Jagiellonian University in Cracow with a complaint of recurrent visual acuity impairment in his left eye, which he had noticed for the first time three years earlier. The complete ophthalmic examination was extended by the additional diagnostic procedures of optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography and the patient was diagnosed with chronic central serous chorioretinopathy. He was eligible for the photodynamic therapy with a full dose of verteporfin, which was performed. The patient was subsequently re-assessed at 3 and 6 months following treatment completion. During the follow up assessment the amount of subretinal fluid on fundus examination and the best-corrected visual acuity (Snellen) were evaluated. The follow up optical coherence tomography was also performed.Six months after photodynamic therapy the subretinal fluid resolved completely, the distance best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.2 to 0.5 and the near best-corrected visual acuity from 2.25 to 0.5. No treatment-induced adverse effects were observed.The photodynamic therapy may be effective in the management of selected cases with chronic central serous chorioretinopathy. central serous chorioretinopathy, photodynamic therapy.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137918","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.820679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.545641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.428835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Central serous retinopathy","weight":0.161683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.141283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
