{"id":37005,"title":"E-learning enables parents to assess an infantile hemangioma.","abstract":"Infantile hemangiomas (IH) at risk for complications need to be recognized early.We sought to determine if parents are able to assess, after e-learning, whether their child has an IH, is at risk for complications, and needs to be seen (urgently) by a specialist.This was a prospective study of 158 parents participating in an IH e-learning module. Parents were asked to assess their child's skin abnormality. A dermatologist answered the same questions (by e-consult). The 2 assessments were compared.Parents showed a 96% concordance with the dermatologist for correct diagnosis after e-learning. Concordances were 79%, 75%, and 84% (P < .001), respectively, on assessing the risk of complications, the need to be seen by a specialist, and the urgency for specialized care.Parents had a relatively high education level and were therefore not representative of the general population.Parents were able to correctly diagnose and evaluate an IH after completing an e-learning module. E-learning by parents could result in earlier presentation and treatment of high-risk IH.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524882","annotations":[{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.473576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"E-learning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"International Harvester","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Harvester"},{"name":"Concordance (publishing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(publishing)"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Module (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
