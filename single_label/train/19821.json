{"id":19821,"title":"T cell response to alpha crystallin and Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific antigens using ex-vivo elispot assay for detecting latent tuberculosis infection in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.","abstract":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persists in a state of non-replication or stationary phase, but resulting in active tuberculosis (TB) when the immune system is suppressed. Alpha-crystallin (ACR) is one of the bacterial antigens characterized known to be related to shifting of the bacilli from growth to a non-replicating persistent state.To compare the ex-vivo responsiveness of active TB patients, close household contacts and healthy controls to specific Mtb antigens.Antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-g) responses were measured to a 16kDa-alpha crystallin (ACR) antigen along with its peptides and other Mtb antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10, PPD, TB10.3 and Ag85A) in 39 active TB patients, 23 close household contacts and 25 community controls, using ex-vivo ELISPOT RESULT: The proportion of responders to ACR was 36% in active TB patients (76 +/- 14 spot forming cells), 48% in close household contacts (123 +/- 31 spot forming cells) and 76% in community controls (165 +/- 29 spot forming cells) indicating the presence of latency more in the community controls compared to the other groups. Sixty percent of community controls (131 +/- 27 spot forming cells), 61% of healthy household contacts (138 +/- 3 spot forming cells) and 54% of TB patients (198 +/- 37 spot forming cells) showed ESAT-6-specific T cell responses.Antigen specific T cell response based on ex-vivo ELISPOT assay using combined ACR and ESAT-6/ CFP-10 antigens can be used as indicator of underlying latent TB infection in tropical setting where tuberculosis is endemic.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696984","annotations":[{"name":"ELISPOT","weight":0.923983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISPOT"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.81497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.728732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.512908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.298706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Addis Ababa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa"},{"name":"Crystallin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallin"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0255931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"}]}
