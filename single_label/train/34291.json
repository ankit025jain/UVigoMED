{"id":34291,"title":"[Neurovegetative stabilization as a pathogenetic therapy for brain damage].","abstract":"The article deals with neurovegetative stabilization as a pathogenetic therapy for brain damage. The approach is based on hypothesis that pharmacological effecting on central nervous system is able to make a passive protective medical system which can be close to passive protective systems widely represented in the nature. Complex opioid and clonidine administration provides sufficient level of neurovegetative stability on account of effecting on neuro-regulative structures the brain steam. Neurovegetative stabilization should be carry out in order of warning principle. In our opinion optimal doses are fentanyl 0.2-1.4 mkg kg(-1) per hour, clonidine 0.2-0.7 mkg kg(-1) per hour, propofol 0.5-2 mkg kg(-1) per hour, penthonal sodium 1-4 mkg kg(-1) per hour; diazepam 0.4-0.5 mkg kg(-1), and midazolam 0.05-0.2 mkg kg(-1) per hour. A criterion of the therapy sufficiency is a consistency between changes of different functional parameters. We believe the most important that new level of functioning must be maximally integrated and harmonized. It is possible if all pharmacological agents include the most reliable programs of adaptation complex human body reactions.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749319","annotations":[{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.725202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Diazepam","weight":0.722417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam"},{"name":"Midazolam","weight":0.713027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midazolam"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.675045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.639625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Brain damage","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clonidine","weight":0.47436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Mak language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mak_language"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Steam engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine"},{"name":"Harmony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Sufficient statistic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic"},{"name":"Global Assessment of Functioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Assessment_of_Functioning"}]}
