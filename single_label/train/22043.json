{"id":22043,"title":"Antibodies to the HMW1/HMW2 and Hia adhesins of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae mediate broad-based opsonophagocytic killing of homologous and heterologous strains.","abstract":"The HMW1/HMW2 and Hia proteins are highly immunogenic surface adhesins of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Approximately 75% of NTHi strains express HMW1/HMW2 adhesins, and most of the remaining 25% express an Hia adhesin. Our objective in this study was to assess the ability of antisera raised against purified HMW1/HMW2 proteins or recombinant Hia proteins to mediate opsonophagocytic killing of a large panel of unrelated NTHi strains. Native HMW1/HMW2 proteins were purified from three HMW1/HMW2-expressing NTHi strains. Recombinant fusion proteins expressing surface-exposed segments of either of two prototype Hia proteins were purified from Escherichia coli transformants. Immune sera raised in guinea pigs were assessed for their ability to mediate killing of NTHi in an opsonophagocytic assay with the HL-60 phagocytic cell line. The three HMW1/HMW2 antisera mediated killing of 22 of 65, 43 of 65, and 28 of 65 unrelated HMW1/HMW2-expressing NTHi strains, respectively. As a group, the three sera mediated killing of 48 of 65 HMW1/HMW2-expressing strains. The two Hia immune sera mediated killing of 12 of 24 and 13 of 24 unrelated Hia-expressing NTHi strains, respectively. Together, they mediated killing of 15 of 24 Hia-expressing strains. Neither the HMW1/HMW2 nor the Hia antisera mediated killing of NTHi expressing the alternative adhesin type. Antibodies directed against native HMW1/HMW2 proteins and recombinant Hia proteins are capable of mediating broad-based opsonophagocytic killing of homologous and heterologous NTHi strains. A vaccine formulated with a limited number of HMW1/HMW2 and Hia proteins might provide protection against disease caused by most NTHi strains.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574538","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Haemophilus influenzae","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"},{"name":"Phagocyte","weight":0.860004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocyte"},{"name":"Antiserum","weight":0.842079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiserum"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.709322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.601911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Bacterial adhesin","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_adhesin"},{"name":"Guinea pig","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"},{"name":"Heterologous","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"House of Lords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Haemophilus","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"}]}
