{"id":80422,"title":"The oxidative status and inflammatory level of the peripheral blood of rabbits infested with Psoroptes cuniculi.","abstract":"Psoroptes cuniculi can parasitise the ear canal of the rabbit, and cause the afflicted animals to cease feeding and become severely debilitated, sometimes resulting in death. In this study, we examined the oxidative status and inflammatory level of the peripheral blood of rabbits infested with Psoroptes cuniculi and investigated the pathogenesis of this disease.A total of 24 rabbits were divided into a healthy rabbit group and two infested rabbit groups. After weighing the rabbits, approximately 5 ml of blood was obtained from each animal. Then, the blood serum was extracted and used to assess the levels of antioxidant enzymes and inflammatory factors.Compared to the healthy rabbits, the activities of catalase and glutathione-S-transferase and the level of malonyldialdehyde were increased, but the activity of superoxide dismutase was reduced in the infested rabbits. At the same time, a variety of inflammatory cells were activated, and the levels of inflammatory factors such as prostaglandin E2, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and transforming growth factor-?1 were increased in peripheral blood.Animal acariasis was associated with immunosuppressive disorders and inflammatory reaction. These results advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of Psoroptes cuniculi infestation in rabbits and can help guide the effectual treatment of this disease in clinics.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667000","annotations":[{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.647192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.631653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.496391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.361876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Ear canal","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Infestation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"}]}
