{"id":62511,"title":"[Febrile cholestatic jaundice as an initial manifestation of Hodgkin's disease].","abstract":"The febrile cholestatic disease as a presentation of Hodgkin's lymphoma is a very unusual condition. We describe here the case of a patient with prolonged fever of unknown origin and progressive jaundice, in whom the diagnosis was made with the analysis of a liver biopsy, given the absence of lymph node involvement that characterizes this disease. We remark the severe and multisystemic involvement of this rapidly progressive disease.
