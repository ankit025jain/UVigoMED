{"id":44845,"title":"Adolescent rumination syndrome.","abstract":"Adolescent Rumination Syndrome (ARS) is a relatively uncommon disorder, defined by the involuntary regurgitation of recently ingested food from the stomach to the mouth, where it is either expelled or re-swallowed. Although the disorder itself is not life-threatening, it typically has a significant medical and psychosocial impact on the patient and family. There continues to be limited awareness about the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ARS among clinicians. As such, adolescents presenting with symptoms of ARS often are misdiagnosed and typically undergo avoidable, extensive, invasive, and costly testing. This article seeks to increase awareness and knowledge about ARS, and to provide the clinician with practical guidelines regarding the pathogenesis, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of ARS.
