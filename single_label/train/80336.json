{"id":80336,"title":"Coccidia (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) of the lowland European bison Bison bonasus bonasus (L.).","abstract":"Coprological studies conducted between 2007 and 2011 in free-roaming and captive European bison Bison bonasus (Linnaeus, 1758) from Poland revealed 11 species of Eimeria infecting the host, i.e., Eimeria alabamensis, Eimeria auburnensis, Eimeria bovis, Eimeria brasiliensis, Eimeria bukidnonensis, Eimeria canadensis, Eimeria cylindrica, Eimeria ellipsoidalis, Eimeria pellita, Eimeria subspherica, and Eimeria zuernii. The typical host for all isolated species is cattle. The most prevalent species was E. bovis (29.7%), while E. brasiliensis was the rarest (0.5%). Five of the species (E. bovis, E. bukidnonensis, E. canadensis, E. ellipsoidalis, E. zuernii) have been observed previously in bison by other authors, 3 species were noticed by us in bison previously (E. alabamensis, E. cylindrica, E. pellita), while for 3 species (E. auburnensis, E. brasiliensis, and E. subspherica) these are new host and locality records. Oocysts of two species (E. brasiliensis, E. bukidnonensis) were noted only in the feces of bison kept in captivity. Moreover, the prevalence of positive samples was higher in the group of captive animals (55.4%) in comparison with the free-roaming herds (29.5%); although, oocysts per gram (OPG), counted with the conventional McMaster technique, was comparable in both groups, reaching maximally 6550 and 6400 in free-roaming and captive individuals, respectively. Overall, 142 fecal samples from 424 samples examined were positive for Eimeria (prevalence=33.5%). Age-related analysis revealed a higher percentage of Eimeria spp. positive samples and higher OPG values in bison under 1 year old as compared to older individuals (93.3% and 50-4050; 37.3% and 50-550, respectively). Additionally, greater eimerian species diversity was present among calves in comparison with older bison. In most cases single-species infections were observed (59.8%) with a predominance of E. bovis (85.9%). Multiple-species infections consisted of 2-7 species, usually including E. bovis. The observation was made that E. bovis infection appears conducive to the host acquiring more eimerian species. No symptoms of clinical coccidiosis occurred during the study.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702772","annotations":[{"name":"Feces","weight":0.816345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Carl Linnaeus","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Apicomplexa","weight":0.678634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa"},{"name":"Coccidia","weight":0.664554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidia"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.558091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.486326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.385345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Bison","weight":0.327057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Wisent","weight":0.283436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisent"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Calf","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf"},{"name":"Captivity (animal)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captivity_(animal)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.0790607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Elymus canadensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elymus_canadensis"},{"name":"Eimeria","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eimeria"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"McMaster University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_University"},{"name":"Lowland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowland"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"6550","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6550"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Systema Naturae","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae"},{"name":"CDC 6400","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6400"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
