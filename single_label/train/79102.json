{"id":79102,"title":"Advanced oxidation protein product level in children with chronic otitis media with effusion.","abstract":"To determine the level of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) in children with chronic otitis media with effusion (COME), in an effort to elucidate the multifactorial etiology of this disease.This study involved 25 COME patients and 30 healthy children (control group) recruited from the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) and Pediatric Departments, respectively, of the Haseki Research and Training Hospital. In the COME group, blood samples were collected before a middle ear operation, and middle ear fluid was sampled during the operation. Blood samples were also obtained from the control subjects. AOPP levels in the plasma and effusion fluid were measured by the spectrophotometric method.In the COME group, the mean AOPP levels in plasma and effusion fluid were 168.08 ?mol/l and 412.75 ?mol/l, respectively. In the control group, the mean plasma AOPP level was 141.54 ?mol/l. The plasma AOPP levels did not significantly differ between the COME and control groups (p>0.05). In the COME group, however, the effusion fluid AOPP level (412.75 ± 204.54 ?mol/l) was significantly higher than the plasma AOPP level (168.08 ± 68.45 ?mol/l; p<0.01).We found that AOPP levels were elevated in the effusion fluid, but not in the plasma, of COME patients. Thus, COME was associated with protein oxidation abnormalities. Oxidative stress may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of COME, and AOPPs may be used as markers of oxidative stress; however, further studies are required to confirm these findings.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491806","annotations":[{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.888559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.742039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.726845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.511488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.506901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.287322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.150309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Gun moll","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_moll"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
