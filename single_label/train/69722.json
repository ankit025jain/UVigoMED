{"id":69722,"title":"[Numerical impairments in genes in breast cancer: a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification study].","abstract":"To analyze breast cancer samples using the new technique multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. MATERIAL AND METHODS; Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast carcinoma samples from 65 patients were examined. After manual microdissection, DNA was isolated using a commercial kit (\"QIAGEN\") and analyzed with SALSA MLPA KIT P078-B1 Breast Tumour (\"MRC-Holland\"). Capillary electrophoresis provided results.MLPA assay was successful in all examined samples. The amplification and deletion frequencies of the analyzed genes were in line with the literature data. The technique requires conventional work-related skills in a molecular genetic laboratory and, as a whole, presents no problems with its usage. The interpretation of results is devoid of subjective meaning due to exclusively their mathematical analysis. MLPA assay provides an insight into numerical impairments in the following genes: ERBB2, MYC, TRAF4, C11orf30 (EMSY), ADAM9, IKBKB, CCNE1, TOP2A, CDH1, CDC6, ESR1, CPD, EGFR, MTDH, CCND1, BIRC5, MED1, FGFR1, MAPT, PRDM14, and AURKA.MLPA is an easy-to-use and promising method for multiplex genetic analysis of tumor cells in breast cancer.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306619","annotations":[{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Breast
