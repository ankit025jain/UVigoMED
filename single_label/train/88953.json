{"id":88953,"title":"Systemic effects of TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) during acute ?-irradiation.","abstract":"The effects of TRAIL at various physiological levels were studied on 101/Hf and C3H/Sn mice during acute ?-irradiation with 750 R. An intravenous injection of TRAIL attenuated the effects of ?-irradiation on the body weight, subfractions of blood plasma, horizontal and vertical activity in the open-field test, tissue injury in the small intestine and liver, and content of Hassall's corpuscles in the thymus. The degree of these changes differed in mice of study strains.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771425","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.771006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.768634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.47269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.440062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.383887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.266109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Complement component 3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_3"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Trail","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Hafnium","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnium"}]}
