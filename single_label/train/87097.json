{"id":87097,"title":"Comparison of antibody response to a non-adjuvanted, live canarypox-vectored recombinant rabies vaccine and a killed, adjuvanted rabies vaccine in Eld's deer (Rucervus eldi thamin).","abstract":"Captive Eld's deer (Rucervus eldi thamin) were evaluated for the presence of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies using a rapid fluorescent focus inhibition after vaccination with either a live canarypox-vectored recombinant rabies vaccine or a killed monovalent rabies vaccine. Twelve deer were vaccinated with 1.0 ml of killed, adjuvanted, monovalent rabies vaccine at 5-33 mo of age then annually thereafter, and 14 deer were vaccinated with 1.0 ml nonadjuvanted, live canarypox-vectored rabies vaccine at 3-15 mo of age then annually thereafter. Banked serum was available or collected prospectively from deer at 6 mo and 1 yr after initial vaccination, then collected annually. Rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies considered adequate (>0.5 IU/ml) were present in 20/34 samples vaccinated with canarypox-vectored rabies vaccine and in 12/14 samples vaccinated with killed adjuvanted rabies vaccine. Poor seroconversion was noted in deer less than 6 mo of age vaccinated with the canarypox-vectored rabies vaccine.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000692","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Rabies","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.731134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.711717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.510143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.369134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.21327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"},{"name":"Rucervus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rucervus"},{"name":"Rabies vaccine","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_vaccine"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"1214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1214"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Eld's Deer","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eld's_Deer"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"}]}
