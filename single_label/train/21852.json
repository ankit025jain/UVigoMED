{"id":21852,"title":"[Relationship between the effectiveness and dose of micafungin in the treatment of candidemia].","abstract":"The Guidelines for Management of Deep-seated Mycoses 2007 recommend the use of micafungin as a first-line agent for the treatment of candidemia. On the package insert, the recommended dose of micafungin is 50 mg/d. However, the Guidelines recommend a micafungin dose of 100-150 mg/d. In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between the effectiveness and dose of micafungin in 42 patients with candidemia who underwent treatment with micafungin. We found that the efficacy rate of micafungin at a dose of 50 mg/d was 40%, whereas that at ?100 mg/d was 87.5%. Moreover, the treatment was more effective in patients who received ?100 mg/d of micafungin as compared to those who received 50 mg/d of micafungin. Furthermore, we assessed the efficacy of micafungin according to the Candida species. Among all patients, the efficacy rate of micafungin was found to be lower in patients infected by Candida parapsilosis as compared to those infected by other Candida species. However, among the patients who received ?100 mg/d of micafungin, the efficacy rate in patients infected by Candida parapsilosis was equivalent to that of patients who were infected by other Candida species. Thus, based on the results of the present study, the optimal micafungin dose for the treatment of candidemia appears to range from 100 to 150 mg/d, as recommended by the Guidelines.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584025","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Micafungin","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micafungin"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fungemia","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungemia"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Package insert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_insert"},{"name":"Moru language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moru_language"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
