{"id":30530,"title":"Insights in the mechanism underlying the protective effect of ?-lipoic acid against acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity.","abstract":"Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the most widely used analgesic antipyretic drugs and is a major cause of acute liver failure at overdose. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible protective effect of ?-lipoic acid (?-LA, 20 or 100 mg/kg administered simultaneously or after 1.5 h) against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Administration of APAP (1.5 g/kg i.p.) resulted in elevation of serum ALT and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content, as well as decrease in hepatic glutathione (GSH) content. In addition, elevation in hepatic hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH oxidase expression was observed accompanied with a significant reduction in glutathione synthase and cystathionine-beta-synthase (C?S) expression. Furthermore, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-?B) activity was enhanced in APAP-treated rats. Administration of the standard APAP antidote; N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 1200 mg/kg) or ?-LA (20 mg/kg), simultaneously or 1.5 h after APAP, ameliorated APAP-induced alterations in liver function, oxidant and inflammatory markers. Importantly, simultaneous administration of NAC or ?-LA (20 mg/kg) was more protective than their later administration. However, the beneficial effect of ?-LA was lost at higher dose level (100 mg/kg). Taken together, the beneficial effects of ?-lipoic acid (20 mg/kg) were comparable to those of NAC which provides a new possible treatment for APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in patients who cannot tolerate NAC. However, careful dose selection is warranted since the beneficial effects of ?-LA were lost at higher doses.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486394","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Antipyretic","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.771039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.708052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.487558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.453812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lipoic acid","weight":0.435248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.423619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Oxidizing agent","weight":0.242091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"NADPH oxidase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADPH_oxidase"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.0120813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"}]}
