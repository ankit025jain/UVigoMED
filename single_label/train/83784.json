{"id":83784,"title":"[Transplantation of adipose tissue multipotent stromal cells in the treatment of chronic ischemia of the lower extremities].","abstract":"The expediency of the stromal cells application, obtained from adipose tissue, was determined in a frame of preclinical investigations conduction, concerning experimental works on laboratory rats, in whom the extremity ischemia was simulated. Histologic and immunohistochemical changes were studied in muscular tissue after transplantation of multipotent stromal cells of own adipose tissue in patients, suffering ischemia of the lower extremity. Reduction of severity of the myofibrills ischemic damage, rapid activation of the muscles regenerative power, accurate stimulation of the angiogenesis processes in 3 mo after transplantation of the cells were demonstrated.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252413","annotations":[{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.564861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.498854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.405245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.399254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.34897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.323004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.249687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Multipotent","weight":0.247452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotent"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.237091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.223116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Laboratory rat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_rat"}]}
