{"id":77535,"title":"Posterior interosseous neuropathy in the distal radial tunnel in a contrabassoon musician.","abstract":"Bassoonists seem to have a high recorded prevalence of performance-related upper limb symptoms. Yet, the background for their symptoms has not been established. This study aimed to diagnose and treat the pathology that caused severe upper limb symptoms in a bassoon/contrabassoon musician in order to allow him to continue his professional career in a symphony orchestra.A detailed neurological bedside examination was undertaken and targeted physiotherapy offered.The physical examination demonstrated weakness, atrophy, and nerve trunk soreness, indicating an affliction of the posterior interosseous nerve (radial tunnel syndrome) or its muscular branches. The risk factors during bassoon playing are comparable to those reported from industrial exposures. The patient was able to resume playing after treatment by nerve mobilisation.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647458","annotations":[{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.637216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.383767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.233534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.10395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Orchestra","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra"},{"name":"Musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"Industrial Revolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution"}]}
