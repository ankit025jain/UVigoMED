{"id":2974,"title":"[Pregnancy in a rudimentary horn of the uterus].","abstract":"Pregnancy in a rudimentary horn of the uterus, a rare form of ectopic pregnancy, develops in women affected by developmental abnormalities of the growth and fusion of the MÃ¼llerian paramesonephric ducts. In the Polish population, this problem affects 4-8 women per year. The paper analyzes the problems that are associated with pregnancy developing in the rudimentary horn. Due to the continuous progress in medical sciences, maternal mortality has been almost completely eliminated in this form of ectopic pregnancy, while neonatal survival has risen to about 20%. Further devel- opments in medicine allow us to be moderately optimis- tic about further improvement of the treatment's statistics.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518088","annotations":[{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.569606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.463434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.405285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.278771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.277421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Healthcare science","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_science"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Paramesonephric duct","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct"},{"name":"Tic","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Poles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Horn (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Congenital abnormality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_abnormality"}]}
