Authors present their frequency and associated mortality and discuss the structure of poisonings with regard to type and causative agents.The data used for analysis were drawn from National Poison Information Center in Lodz. They were divided into two groups. The first one comprised informations about patients treated in TU, whereas the second one included cases treated in other hospitals and only consulted by TU staff.Analysis of obtained data showed that medications overdose was the most frequent cause of hospitalization during 2002-2011.
