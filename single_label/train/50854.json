{"id":50854,"title":"The correlation between immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2 and the prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer.","abstract":"The Objectives: The goal of the study was to evaluate the correlation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression with tumor spread, metastasis, survival and recurrence in early and advanced-stage Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC).Medical records of patients, hospitalized at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Izmir AtatÃ¼rk Training and Research Hospital between 2003 and 2008, were reviewed. Patient age, tumor size, localization, histologic type and tumor grade, stage, metastasis status, patient outcomes and follow-up data were obtained from the records of the obstetrics and gynecology clinic, as well as during face-to-face or telephone interviews.The percentage of MMP-2 staining (expression) in the epithelial cells was not significantly associated with tumor stage and grade, histologic type, tumor diameter recurrence and overall survival (p > 0.05). A significant correlation was found between the percentage of MMP-2 staining (expression) and metastasis status (p < 0.05). The staining intensity of MMP-2 was not significantly associated with tumor stage and grade, diameter recurrence, metastasis and overall survival (p > 0.05), but was with histologic type (p < 0.05). Total scores were not significantly associated with tumor stage and grade, histologic type, tumor diameter recurrence, metastasis and overall survival (p > 0.05). Stromal staining (expression) of MMP-2 was not significantly correlated with tumor stage and grade, histologic type, tumor diameter and outcomes (p > 0.05), but was with recurrence and presence of metastasis (p < 0.05). No significant association was found between the overall survival and percentage of MMP-2 staining (p > 0.05), total score (p > 0.05) and staining intensity (p > 0.05). The association of disease-free survival with the percentage of MMP-2 staining (p > 0.05), total score (p > 0.05), staining intensity (p > 0.05) and stromal staining (p > 0.05) was not statistically significant. The survival of patients with positive stromal staining was significantly shorter compared to cases with negative stromal staining (p < 0.05).Large-scale, comprehensive research is needed to verify whether MMP 2 may be used as a routine prognostic factor for EOC.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745158","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.811652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Obstetrics and gynaecology","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.740171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.597412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.586326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.394798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.222485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.199524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0180677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
