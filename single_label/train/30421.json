{"id":30421,"title":"Changing low income smokers' beliefs about tobacco dependence treatment.","abstract":"This field study tested an intervention that challenged beliefs about the effectiveness of various quit methods held by Salvation Army client smokers from two urban locations (N = 245). Data (surveys administered immediately after and one month post-intervention) were collected 2009-2010 and analyzed using primarily ?(2) and t-tests. The intervention changed client perceptions about the effectiveness of quitting methods. Compared to no-intervention controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater smoking reduction and greater likelihood of contacting the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line. Study implications/limitations are discussed and future research directions noted. This research was supported by grant UL1TR000427 from the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502374","annotations":[{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.606909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.592647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.526465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.48582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.380659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Wisconsin","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin"},{"name":"The Salvation Army","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Grant (money)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_(money)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"United States Army","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Clinical and Translational Science Award","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_and_Translational_Science_Award"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Salvation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation"},{"name":"Theodore Roosevelt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt"},{"name":"University of London","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London"},{"name":"Translation (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(physics)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Cathepsin A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathepsin_A"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Field study","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_study"}]}
