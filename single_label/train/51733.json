{"id":51733,"title":"An integrated medical treatment for type-2 diabetes.","abstract":"This paper tries to emphasize two relevant concepts: the first is that type 2 diabetes is a chronic diseases characterized by both a dysmetabolism and a chronic oxidative stress. A variety of orthodox drugs are somewhat able to correct the metabolic alterations, but do not deal with the chronic inflammation. Consequently, as the validity of precisely treating blood with therapeutic ozone concentrations in restoring a redox homeostasis has been now demonstrated, the integration of ozone therapy appears essential for a rational treatment of type 2 diabetes. Such a combination may be able to reduce the diabetic epidemic.
