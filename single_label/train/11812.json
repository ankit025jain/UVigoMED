{"id":11812,"title":"Dysferlin mediates the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2 following myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury.","abstract":"We have demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), a scaffolding protein common to TNF receptors 1 and 2, confers cytoprotection in the heart. However, the mechanisms for the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2 are not known.Mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of low levels of TRAF2 (MHC-TRAF2LC) and a dominant negative TRAF2 (MHC-TRAF2DN) were subjected to ischemia (30-minute) reperfusion (60-minute) injury (I/R), using a Langendorff apparatus. MHC-TRAF2LC mice were protected against I/R injury as shown by a significant ?27% greater left ventricular (LV) developed pressure after I/R, whereas mice with impaired TRAF2 signaling had a significantly ?38% lower LV developed pressure, a ?41% greater creatine kinase (CK) release, and ?52% greater Evans blue dye uptake after I/R, compared to LM. Transcriptional profiling of MHC-TRAF2LC and MHC-TRAF2DN mice identified a calcium-triggered exocytotic membrane repair protein, dysferlin, as a potential cytoprotective gene responsible for the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2. Mice lacking dysferlin had a significant ?39% lower LV developed pressure, a ?20% greater CK release, and ?29% greater Evans blue dye uptake after I/R, compared to wild-type mice, thus phenocopying the response to tissue injury in the MHC-TRAF2DN mice. Moreover, breeding MHC-TRAF2LC onto a dysferlin-null background significantly attenuated the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2 after I/R injury.The study shows that dysferlin, a calcium-triggered exocytotic membrane repair protein, is required for the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2-mediated signaling after I/R injury.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572254","annotations":[{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.868762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.826185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.804242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.749179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.738195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Exocytosis","weight":0.717758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocytosis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.693471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.656734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.636608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.605208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.582528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.289392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.135743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.0808505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"TRAF2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAF2"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Transcriptional regulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_regulation"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
