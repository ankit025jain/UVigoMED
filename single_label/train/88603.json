{"id":88603,"title":"Physicians' opinions and clinical practice patterns for actinic keratosis management in Italy.","abstract":"We report dermatologists' opinions and clinical practice patterns about clinical factors driving decision making in the management of actinic keratosis (AK) in Italy.We carried out a cross-sectional survey among 33 Italian dermatologists. Physicians were asked to report their management choices in consecutive patients with AK seen at their practice within 2 weeks since study initiation. We collected patients' clinical and socio-demographic characteristics with a standardized data collection form and assessed physicians' opinions on AK management with a self-reported questionnaire.Six hundred fifty-seven patients with new, single AK lesions without evidence of photo-damaged skin in the surrounding areas, were predominantly treated with lesion-directed therapies (primarily cryotherapy). In contrast, physicians preferentially prescribed field-directed therapies to patients with multiple lesions and evidence of photo-damaged skin in AK surrounding areas. However we observed a wide variation in treatment choices and physicians' opinions on AK management. Dermatologists underlined the importance of fostering patients' adherence and minimize therapy side effects.Overall, our results show that current guidelines regarding management of AK are only partially integrated in dermatology practice. The active dissemination of up-to-date national guidelines might help harmonize clinical decision making in this complex and fast growing therapeutic area.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819638","annotations":[{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.746494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Cryotherapy","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.712569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.515992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.370755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Actinic keratosis","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinic_keratosis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Alaska","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Harmony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Keratosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratosis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"}]}
