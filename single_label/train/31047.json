{"id":31047,"title":"Time-dependent changes in nicotine behavioral responsivity during early withdrawal from chronic cocaine administration and attenuation of cocaine sensitization by mecamylamine.","abstract":"Cocaine abuse is associated with a high prevalence of nicotine dependence. In animals, nicotinic antagonists have been reported to block the development of cocaine behavioral sensitization and to attenuate cocaine place preference or self-administration. In the present study, we have determined: (1) changes in the locomotor responses to nicotine challenge during the first week of withdrawal from daily cocaine pretreatment; and (2) effects of the non-selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine given during the first 5 days of cocaine withdrawal on the maintenance of cocaine behavioral sensitization. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with daily saline (SI) or cocaine (CI) injections for 14 days. In Experiment 1, separate animals in the SI and CI groups received a single nicotine challenge on day 1, 3, or 7 of withdrawal from their respective pretreatments. The CI group displayed enhanced locomotor responses to nicotine as compared to SI controls on days 3 and 7 of withdrawal, but not day 1. In Experiment 2, SI and CI animals were treated once a day with either saline or mecamylamine during the first 5 days of withdrawal, and were subsequently challenged with single cocaine injections on both withdrawal days 7 and 14. Mecamylamine treatment significantly attenuated expression of cocaine behavioral sensitization on both withdrawal days 7 and 14. Time-dependent changes in nicotinic responses occur during the first week of cocaine withdrawal, and intact nAChR neurotransmission during this period may be necessary for maintenance of cocaine behavioral sensitization.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412684","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Neurotransmission","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmission"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Nicotinic antagonist","weight":0.717944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_antagonist"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.598597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.479736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.429685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.326113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Mecamylamine","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecamylamine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.18735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0785611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0263793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"}]}
