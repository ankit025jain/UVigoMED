{"id":36639,"title":"Sinus rhythm detection of conducting channels and ventricular tachycardia isthmus in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"The identification of conducting channels (CCs) based on its relative high voltage or the presence of electrograms with delayed components has been proposed for substrate-guided scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. The relationship of these channels with the VT isthmuses remains unclear.To assess the link between CCs identified during sinus rhythm (SR) and VT isthmuses in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).Twenty-two consecutive patients with ARVC undergoing substrate-guided VT ablation (scar dechanneling technique) were analyzed. High-density endocardial and epicardial electroanatomic maps were obtained during SR. Standard bipolar cutoff values (0.5-1.5 and <0.5 mV) were used to define border zone and dense scar. The CCs were identified by voltage threshold adjustment (voltage channels) or by tagging the electrograms with delayed components that are sequentially activated (late potential channels).A total of 87 CCs were identified; 65 (74.7%) of them on the epicardial surface. Twenty-four (27.6%) CCs were voltage channels, and compared with late potential CCs, these had a higher bipolar voltage (0.96 [0.48-1.29] mV vs 0.39 [0.26-0.50] mV; P < .001] and required more radiofrequency applications (5 [4-7] vs 3 [2-5]; P = .048]. Eighteen (90%) of 20 identified VT isthmuses were located on the epicardium. Only 8 (40%) VT isthmuses were related to a voltage CC. The remaining 12 (60%) VT isthmuses were linked to a late potential CC.Late potential CCs more frequently act as the VT substrate in ARVC and therefore should also be considered to guide SR substrate-guided ablation.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561159","annotations":[{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.696267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Ventricular tachycardia","weight":0.525993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.513614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.385704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia","weight":0.233456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmogenic_right_ventricular_dysplasia"},{"name":"Endocardium","weight":0.221617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocardium"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0713112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Isthmus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus"},{"name":"Epicardium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicardium"},{"name":"Sinus rhythm","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_rhythm"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Sinoatrial node","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinoatrial_node"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Voltage","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"260","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/260"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"High voltage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_voltage"},{"name":"Border Security Zone of Russia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Security_Zone_of_Russia"},{"name":"Epicardial","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicardial"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Electrical conductor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tag (metadata)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"}]}
