{"id":90399,"title":"Accelerated partial breast irradiation with external beam three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Five-year results of a prospective phase II clinical study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to report the 5-year results of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using external beam three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT).Between 2006 and 2011, 44 patients with low-risk, stage I-II breast cancer underwent breast-conserving surgery. Postoperative APBI was given by means of 3D-CRT using three to five non-coplanar fields. The total dose of APBI was 36.9 Gy (nine fractions of 4.1 Gy b.i.d.). The mean follow-up time was 58.2 months for surviving patients. Survival results, side effects, and cosmetic results were assessed.One (2.3%) local recurrence was observed, for a 5-year actuarial rate of 3.7%. Neither regional nor distant failure was observed. Two patients died of internal disease. The 5-year disease-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival rates were 96.3, 100, and 95.1%, respectively. Acute side effects included grade 1 (G1) erythema in 75%, G1 parenchymal induration in 46%, and G1 pain in 46% of patients. No G2 or higher acute side effect occurred. Late side effects included G1, G2, and G3 fibrosis in 44, 7, and 2% of patients, respectively, G1 skin pigmentation in 12%, and G1 pain in 2%. Asymptomatic fat necrosis occurred in 14%. Cosmetic results were rated excellent or good in 86% of cases by the patients themselves and 84% by the physicians.The 5-year local tumor control, toxicity profile, and cosmetic results of APBI delivered with external beam 3D-CRT are encouraging and comparable to other APBI series.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619017","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.751623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.721288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.677942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Human skin color","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.552922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.438285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Fat necrosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_necrosis"},{"name":"The Guardian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Radiation hardening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening"}]}
