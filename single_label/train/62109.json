{"id":62109,"title":"Phase distribution of chronic myeloid leukemia in Bangladesh.","abstract":"Here, we report the phase distribution of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), defined based on the World Health Organization criteria, among 63 patients in Bangladesh. All patients were diagnosed based on complete blood count, bone marrow examination including bone marrow aspiration and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Out of 63 patients, 42 were male and 21 were female. The mean age of the subjects was 37.4 years, with an age range of 17-60 years. The majority of patients (86%) were classified in the chronic phase (CP), 7 (11%) in the accelerated phase (AP) and two (3%) in blast crisis (BC). The most frequent patient age ranges were 21-30 years for CP, 41-50 years for AP and 41-50 years for BC.The Philadelphia chromosome was detected in 48 patients by RT-PCR. The mean total leukocyte counts, platelet counts, hemoglobin levels and marrow blast frequencies were 101?×?10(9)/L, 409?×?10(9)/L, 12.2 g/dl and 2.8% for CP; 121?×?10(9)/L, 418?×?10(9)/L, 8.7 g/dl and 15% for AP and 311?×?10(9)/L, 396?×?10(9)/L, 9.2 g/dl and 26% for BC, respectively.This study concluded that most CML patients in Bangladesh are from a younger age group (31-40 years). In addition, males were more commonly affected, although females were afflicted with this disease at a younger age.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621354","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Philadelphia chromosome","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_chromosome"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bone marrow examination","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_examination"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.646945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Philadelphia","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.289089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Bangladesh","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.114755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"}]}
