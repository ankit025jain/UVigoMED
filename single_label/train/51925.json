{"id":51925,"title":"[Thyroid dysfunction in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors].","abstract":"Tyrosine kinase Inhibitors are relatively new drugs used for treatment of several malignancies. The treatment is generally well tolerated, incidence of side effects of significant intensity is low. Hypothyroidism is a frequent complication, the mechanism and guidelines on endocrine treatment remain controversial. Observations indicate that hypothyroidism during treatment is correlated with higher probability of better response to treatment. Further research is necessary to establish guidelines on thyroid function tests and indications for treatment of hypothyroidism.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645578","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.775784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.240152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.158616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.113719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thyroid function tests","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_function_tests"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"}]}
