{"id":4745,"title":"Hospitals prepare plans, drill staff to ensure that potential Ebola patients are identified, isolated, and managed safely.","abstract":"Hospitals around the country have stepped up their efforts to train staff and implement procedures to ensure the safe identification and management of any patients with signs of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA, held an \"Ebola preparedness exercise\" to give staff an opportunity to walk through the hospital's protocol for handling a simulated patient with EVD. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Medical Center has held similar exercises, and is now holding twice-weekly meetings of its leadership team to make sure that all new developments in the Ebola outbreak are communicated. UCLA Medical Center has prepared PPE kits based on the practices developed at Emory University Hospital, which has thus far had the most experience in this country in caring for patients with EVD. The UCLA Health System has adjusted its medical record system so that a red flag is placed on the electronic medical record [EMR] of any patient who has recently traveled to a high-risk area. UAB Medical Center has incorporated what had been a paper-and-pencil screening tool for EVD into its electronic medical record. Training on PPE as well as EVD screening is being provided to first-responders and 911 call center dispatchers in the UAB system.","date":"2014-12-19","categories":"Virus
