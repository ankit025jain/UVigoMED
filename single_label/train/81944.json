{"id":81944,"title":"Polymorphisms of microRNA-binding sites in integrin genes are associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility and progression.","abstract":"Integrins, which act as an important role in the connection between cells and extra-cellular environments, are important cell surface receptors. Integrins have been demonstrated to play critical roles in many aspects of the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA-binding sites of integrin genes and the susceptibility and progression of OSCC in Chinese Han Population. We recruited 167 OSCC patients and 200 cancer-free controls from three independent medical centers. Genotyping was completed successfully for the five selected integrin SNPs: rs1062484 (integrin ?3), rs11902171 (integrin ?v), rs17468 (integrin ?1), rs3809865 (integrin ?3), and rs2675 (integrin ?5). The results demonstrated that the A allele of rs3809865 T/A (a T-to-A nucleotide change), a functional polymorphism in the 3'UTR of integrin ?3 gene, was associated with OSCC risk (p < 0.05). In addition, the association analysis between this SNP and integrin ?3 mRNA expression level in the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated that OSCC patients carrying the A allele would have a lower integrin ?3 expression level (p = 0.047). Meanwhile, survival analysis showed that the C allele of rs2675 A/C (nucleotide change from A to C), another 3'UTR polymorphism in integrin ?5 gene, was related with progression of OSCC. Overall, our results suggest that rs3809865 and rs2675 may contribute to OSCC risk and progression in Chinese Han Population. These two SNPs may be used as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for OSCC in future.
