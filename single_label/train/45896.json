{"id":45896,"title":"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of rebamipide for gastric mucosal injury taking aspirin with or without clopidogrel.","abstract":"Antithrombotic drugs, such as low-dose aspirin (LDA) and clopidogrel, can cause upper gastrointestinal complications.The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a mucosal-protective agent, rebamipide, could prevent gastric mucosal injuries induced by LDA with or without clopidogrel in healthy subjects.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed with 32 healthy male volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to a 14-day course of one of the following regimens: group A, placebo (tid) + LDA; group B, rebamipide (100 mg tid) + LDA (100 mg once-daily); group C, placebo + LDA + clopidogrel (75 mg once-daily); or group D, rebamipide + LDA + clopidogrel. The grade of gastric mucosal injuries was evaluated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy before and after dosing (on day 0 and day 14), and the grade of gastric mucosal injury was assessed according to the modified Lanza score. Subjective symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). A rapid urease test was performed on day 0, and blood tests were performed on day 0 and day 14.Rebamipide significantly inhibited gastric mucosal injury induced by LDA alone or by LDA plus clopidogrel when compared with placebo in healthy subjects. GSRS score and hemoglobin level were not significantly different among the four groups.Rebamipide is useful for the primary prevention of gastric mucosal injury induced by LDA alone or by LDA plus clopidogrel in healthy subjects.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659236","annotations":[{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.594719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.561002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.28316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.237013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.183889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Antithrombotic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithrombotic"},{"name":"2011 Australian Open","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Open"}]}
