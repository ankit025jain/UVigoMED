{"id":24995,"title":"The index and improvement effect of using Danhong injection to patients with atherosclerosis symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD).","abstract":"The clinical effects of coronary heart disease unstable angina treated by Danhong injection as well as its influence on Hcy (Homoeystein), Hs-CRP (High sensitivity C-reactive protein) and NT(-pro)BNP (N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) were observed. 72 cases of hospitalized patients in Gaomi city people's hospital cardiology department confirmed to the standard of coronary heart disease unstable angina were selected, and were divided randomly into experimental group (red) and the control group with 36 cases in each group. Based on conventional western medicine treatment, experimental group combined with Danhong injection 20 ml; while the control group with blood producing needle 400 mg. After two weeks treatment, symptoms were observed before and after treatment.Hcy (Homoeystein), Hs-CRP (High sensitivity C-reactive protein) and NT(-pro)BNP (N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) of two groups were lowered before and after treatment, there was statistical difference (P<0.05). The comparison of Hs-CRP (High sensitivity C-reactive protein), NT(-pro)BNP (N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) between two groups after treatment was statistically different, experimental group was better than that of control group, (P<0.05).Danhong injection is traditional Chinese medicine preparations to treat coronary heart disease unstable angina for its curative effect affirmation and good safety, and its improvement onHcy (Homoeystein), Hs-CRP (High sensitivity C-reactive protein), NT(-pro)BNP (N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) and other laboratory index and is worthy of clinical use and further study.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262522","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.81272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.651658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.571231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.564176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.489115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.469944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"China","weight":0.41596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.36926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.285466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.261899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.129255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.127785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
