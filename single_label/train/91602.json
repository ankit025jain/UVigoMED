{"id":91602,"title":"Traumatic injury induces changes in the expression of the serotonin  1A receptor in the spinal cord of lampreys.","abstract":"After spinal cord injury (SCI) in mammals, the loss of serotonin coming from the brainstem reduces the excitability of motor neurons and leads to a compensatory overexpression of serotonin receptors. Despite the key role of the serotonin receptor 1a in the control of locomotion, little attention has been put in the study of this receptor after SCI. In contrast to mammals, lampreys recover locomotion after a complete SCI, so, studies in this specie could help to understand events that lead to recovery of function. Here, we showed that in lampreys there is an acute increase in the expression of the serotonin 1A receptor transcript (5-ht1a) after SCI and a few weeks later expression levels go back to normal rostrally and caudally to the lesion. Overexpression of the 5-ht1a in rostral levels after SCI has not been reported in mammals, suggesting that this could be part of the plastic events that lead to the recovery of function in lampreys. The analysis of changes in 5-ht1a expression by zones (periventricular region and horizontally extended grey matter) showed that they followed the same pattern of changes detected in the spinal cord as a whole, with the exception of the caudal periventricular layer, where no significant differences were observed between control and experimental animals at any time post lesion. This suggests that different molecular signals act on the periventricular cells of the rostral and caudal regions to injury site and thus affecting their response to the injury in terms of expression of the 5-ht1a.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490228","annotations":[{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Grey matter","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_matter"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.712539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lamprey","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamprey"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.490115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.440351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Animal locomotion","weight":0.316152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_locomotion"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Caudal","weight":0.248284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudal"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.229404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.148115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Grey","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"5-HT receptor","weight":0.0239124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT_receptor"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
