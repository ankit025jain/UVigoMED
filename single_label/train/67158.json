{"id":67158,"title":"Associated factors and prevalence of erectile dysfunction in hemodialysis patients.","abstract":"The proposal of this study was to determine the prevalence and the associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) among hemodialysis (HD) patients.This was a cross-sectional study based on data collected from HD male patients. Clinical, demographic and laboratory data of all patients were collected in three HD clinics from December 2010 to June 2011. Patients answered questions of erectile function domain from International Index of Erectile Function. Data were evaluated by descriptive analysis and by univariate (ULRA) and multivariate logistic regression analysis (MLRA).Three hundred and five patients participated of the study. The prevalence of ED was 68.19%. ED was associated with diabetes (DM), benign prostatic hyperplasia, glomerulonephritis as cause of chronic renal failure (CRF), smoking habits, lower creatinine levels (ULRA), use of calcium channel blocker (MLRA), aging, lower education level, alcohol consumption, DM (as cause of CRF) and coronary insufficiency (ULRA and MLRA).ED was highly prevalent in the HD men. It was independently associated with aging, current use of alcohol, long alcohol use (even for those who do not drink more), lower education level, diabetes as cause of CRF, coronary insufficiency and use of channel blockers calcium.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642163","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.89756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.786361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.725667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Glomerulonephritis","weight":0.653222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.583205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.576586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.571044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.485032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.459022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.383807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.372245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.245616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.16006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.114428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Corticotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
