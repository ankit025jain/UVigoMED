{"id":75050,"title":"A commonly used Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease generates an aberrant species of amyloid-? with an additional N-terminal glutamine residue.","abstract":"Expression of human amyloid-? (A?) in Drosophila is frequently used to investigate its toxicity in vivo. We expressed A?1-42 in the fly using a secretion signal derived from the Drosophila necrotic gene, as described in several previous publications. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization TOF MS analysis revealed that the A? produced contained an additional glutamine residue at the N-terminus. A?Q+1-42 was found to have increased protein abundance and to cause more severe neurodegenerative effects than wild type A?1-42 as assessed by locomotor activity and lifespan assays. These data reveal that a commonly used model of Alzheimer's disease generates incorrect A? peptide.
