{"id":87618,"title":"Quality of life after volar locked plating: a 10-year follow-up study of patients with intra-articular distal radius fractures.","abstract":"This study aimed to present functional results and patient's health related quality of life (HRQOL) data ten years after volar locked plate fixation (VPF) of unstable intra-articular distal radial fractures (DRF).Thirty-nine patients with a mean age of sixty-one years were operatively treated with VPF after intra-articular distal radial fractures. They were evaluated two, six, and ten years postoperatively according to the Gartland and Werley score. For subjective evaluation the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires were adopted.Overall, wrist function did not differ significantly two, six and ten years after the operation. Over 90% patients achieved \"good\" or \"excellent\" results ten years after surgery according to the Gartland and Werley score. Ten years postoperatively the results of the SF 36 did not differ significantly from the two- and six-year follow-up. Overall findings from the SF-36 did not differ significantly from the data of Austrian and American norm populations. Only in the subscale of mental health (MH) the ten-year follow-up did show significantly poorer results (p = 0.045) compared to the Austrian norm population. The median DASH scores did not show significant differences during the ten-year follow-up period.The ten-year results of this single-center study suggest that operative treatment of intra-articular DRF with volar locked plates is a useful and satisfactory therapy option, both in terms of function and HRQOL.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059690","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.542097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.418291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.356056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.292993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.25753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.215871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0180608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Codec listening test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec_listening_test"},{"name":"Daily Racing Form","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Racing_Form"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Vector Product Format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Product_Format"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Medal of Honor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0141339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
