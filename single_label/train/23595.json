{"id":23595,"title":"Nosocomial outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium primarily affecting a pediatric ward in South Africa in 2012.","abstract":"We describe a nosocomial outbreak of diarrheal disease caused by extended-spectrum ?-lactamase-producing multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, focused on a pediatric ward in South Africa. The outbreak peaked between May 2012 and July 2012. Person-to-person transmission was the most likely mechanism of spread of the infection, expedited due to a breakdown in hand-washing and hygiene, suboptimal infection control practices, overcrowding of hospital wards, and an undesirable nurse-to-patient ratio.
