{"id":70803,"title":"The impact of a tumor diagnosis on patients' attitudes toward advance directives.","abstract":"Although advance care planning and the completion of advance directives (ADs) are important tools to avoid unwanted aggressive care once patients have lost their decision-making capacity, only a minority of cancer patients are admitted with completed ADs, and little is known about patients' wishes regarding AD consultations.For 1 year, every new patient admitted to the hematology/oncology outpatient clinic of the University Hospital Regensburg received a self-administered questionnaire comprising a self-evaluation of AD knowledge and questions about preferences regarding consultation partners and the time of consultation. Disease-related data were collected from medical records. Statistics were calculated with SPSS.Of the 500 questionnaires handed out, 394 (75%) were evaluable and analyzed. Twenty-eight percent of the participants had completed an AD (living will or health care proxy). Ninety-two percent of the participants without ADs had never received a consultation offer from any professional involved. Only 20% perceived a clear relation between cancer and AD consultations. More than 50% of the participants without ADs were in favor of consultations 'now' or 'in a few weeks', while more than 40% objected to AD consultations.Oncology patients have a large unmet demand for AD consultations. However, a relevant percentage of these patients object to AD consultations. Structured and early AD consultation offers should be made, and early discussions about indications for aggressive treatment should take place.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139124","annotations":[{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.243345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Advance health care directive","weight":0.216946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_health_care_directive"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.121109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Regensburg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Health care proxy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_proxy"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"394","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/394"},{"name":"Directive (European Union)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Assistant director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_director"},{"name":"Nursing care plan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_care_plan"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"}]}
