{"id":82546,"title":"Autoantibodies against complement C1q in patients with Behcet's disease: association with vascular involvement.","abstract":"The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of anti-C1q antibodies and their possible association with clinical presentation in Behcet's disease (BD) patients with special emphasis for patients with vascular involvement.Plasma anti-C1q Abs levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 51 BD patients and 25 age- and gender-matched healthy controls.We found elevated concentrations of anti-C1q more frequently in patients with BD (18 %) than in healthy controls (8 %). The highest prevalence was found in patients with vascular BD (42 %) which was significantly higher than patients without vascular BD and healthy controls (p = 0.025). Furthermore, patients with vascular BD had the highest mean anti-C1q levels when compared to BD patients without vascular involvement or healthy control subjects (p = 0.015). We did not find significant differences in the prevalence of any other organ involvement between BD patients with elevated vs. normal anti-C1q ab levels. Anti-C1q ab levels positively correlated with ESR (r = 0.383, p = 0.006) and negatively with C4 (r = -0.304, p = 0.030).In conclusion, we found an increased prevalence of anti-C1q autoantibodies in BD patients with vascular involvement. Further large scale longitudinal studies are required to assess and clarify the significance and the pathogenic role of anti-C1q antibodies in BD and other autoimmune diseases in which vasculitis is a component.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593207","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.708277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.676279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.641133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.640194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.511584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.307663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.180511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"C1Q complex","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C1Q_complex"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"304","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/304"},{"name":"C4 carbon fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Bachelor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"Abz Love","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abz_Love"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
