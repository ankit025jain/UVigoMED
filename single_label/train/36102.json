{"id":36102,"title":"Prevention of neural tube defects by folic acid - awareness among women of childbearing age in Slovakia.","abstract":"Folic acid deficiency plays a central role in the aetiology of many congenital anomalies including neural tube defects. Protective effect of folic acid on embryo may be acquired only if taken periconceptionally.The aim of the study was to investigate the awareness about folic acid among women of childbearing age in Bratislava, Slovakia.There were 130 respondents involved in the research (106 pregnant women, 24 female students of medical faculty). Using questionnaire we acquired following data: pregnancy details, interest in diet before and during pregnancy, recommendations regarding nutrition and supplementation pre- and post-conception, knowledge about folic and other acid in 2004 and 2009.More than half of the respondents knew the sources of folic acid. The interest in the nutrition facts of the food dropped from 91 % to 58.5 %. The number of pregnant women advised about correct nutrition and folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy increased from 16 % to 37 %. Planning the next gravidity with folic acid supplementation became greater than 21 % (38 % in 2009). Nevertheless, only 46 % of these women believed that proper food content with folic acid may prevent congenital anomalies. In a group of students planning to take folic acid periconceptionally the number raised up to 62.5 %.The results revealed low knowledge about the effect of folic acid on developing embryo among women of childbearing age. Effective intervention programs are needed with the aim to improve periconceptional intake of folic acid in 2004 and 2009. The results in both periods show low knowledge about this essential vitamin (Tab. 1, Fig. 8, Ref. 31).","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601703","annotations":[{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.803461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Folate deficiency","weight":0.563871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate_deficiency"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.553879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.440443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Slovakia","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Neural tube defect","weight":0.280275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Glossary of terms associated with gravidity","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_terms_associated_with_gravidity"},{"name":"Neural tube","weight":0.212801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bratislava","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Teacher","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Nutrition facts label","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition_facts_label"}]}
