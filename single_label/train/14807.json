{"id":14807,"title":"Amitriptyline, clomipramine, and maprotiline attenuate the inflammatory response by inhibiting neutrophil migration and mast cell degranulation.","abstract":"Despite the recognized anti-inflammatory potential of heterocyclic antidepressants, the mechanisms concerning their modulating effects are not completely known. Thus, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of amitriptyline, clomipramine, and maprotiline and the possible modulating properties of these drugs on neutrophil migration and mast cell degranulation.The hind paw edema and air-pouch models of inflammation were used. Male Wistar rats were treated with saline, amitriptyline, clomipramine or maprotiline (10, 30, or 90 mg/kg, per os [p.o.]) 1 h before the injection of carrageenan (300 ?g/0.1 mL/paw) or dextran (500 ?g/0.1 mL/paw). Then, edema formation was measured hourly. Neutrophil migration to carrageenan (500 ?g/pouch) and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) (10-6 M/mL/pouch) was also investigated in 6-day-old air-pouch cavities. Compound 48/80-induced mast cell degranulation was assessed in the mesenteric tissues of antidepressant-treated rats.All tested antidepressants prevented both carrageenan- and dextran-induced edema. The anti-inflammatory effect of these drugs partially depends on the modulation of neutrophil migration, since they significantly counteracted the chemotactic response of both carrageenan and fMLP (p < 0.01). Furthermore, amitriptyline, clomipramine and maprotiline inhibited compound 48/80-induced mast cell degranulation (p < 0.001).These results suggest an important anti-inflammatory role of heterocyclic antidepressants, which is dependent on the modulation of neutrophil migration and mast cell stabilization.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24402214","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Amitriptyline","weight":0.839196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.808264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Degranulation","weight":0.774264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degranulation"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.736259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.688541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.619073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Heterocyclic compound","weight":0.573055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterocyclic_compound"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.489611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.472209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dextran","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextran"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.165707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Carrageenan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan"},{"name":"Clomipramine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomipramine"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"}]}
