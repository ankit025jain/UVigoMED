{"id":47517,"title":"A giant hepatic cyst.","abstract":"Liver cysts occur in approximately 5% of the population. However, only about 5% of these patients ever develop symptoms. In general, cysts are thin-walled structures that contain fluid. Most cysts are single, although some patients may have several. Here we report a case of a giant hepatic cyst in a 50 year old female who was admitted in our Hospital for right upper quadrant pain and abdominal lump. She was thoroughly investigated with ultrasonography, and computerized tomography scan of the abdomen along with other supportive investigations, and was diagnosed as having a 30Ã—25cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver. Exploratory laparotomy and partial cystectomy with drainage & marsupialization were performed in the patient.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584391","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.799206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Right upper quadrant (abdomen)","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.265097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.115375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Marsupialization","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupialization"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Right lobe of liver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_lobe_of_liver"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
