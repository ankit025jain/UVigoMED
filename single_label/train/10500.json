{"id":10500,"title":"Recombinant IL-21 and anti-CD4 antibodies cooperate in syngeneic neuroblastoma immunotherapy and mediate long-lasting immunity.","abstract":"IL-21 is an immune-enhancing cytokine, which showed promising results in cancer immunotherapy. We previously observed that the administration of anti-CD4 cell-depleting antibody strongly enhanced the anti-tumor effects of an IL-21-engineered neuroblastoma (NB) cell vaccine. Here, we studied the therapeutic effects of a combination of recombinant (r) IL-21 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in a syngeneic model of disseminated NB. Subcutaneous rIL-21 therapy at 0.5 or 1 ?g/dose (at days 2, 6, 9, 13 and 15 after NB induction) had a limited effect on NB development. However, coadministration of rIL-21 at the two dose levels and a cell-depleting anti-CD4 mAb cured 28 and 70 % of mice, respectively. Combined immunotherapy was also effective if started 7 days after NB implant, resulting in a 30 % cure rate. Anti-CD4 antibody treatment efficiently depleted CD4(+) CD25(high) Treg cells, but alone had limited impact on NB. Combination immunotherapy by anti-CD4 mAb and rIL-21 induced a CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, which resulted in tumor eradication and long-lasting immunity. CD4(+) T cells, which re-populated mice after combination immunotherapy, were required for immunity to NB antigens as indicated by CD4(+) T cell depletion and re-challenge experiments. In conclusion, these data support a role for regulatory CD4(+) T cells in a syngeneic NB model and suggest that rIL-21 combined with CD4(+) T cell depletion reprograms CD4(+) T cells from immune regulatory to anti-tumor functions. These observations open new perspectives for the use of IL-21-based immunotherapy in conjunction with transient CD4(+) T cell depletion, in human metastatic NB.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647609","annotations":[{"name":"CD25","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.891068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Cancer immunotherapy","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunotherapy"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.738209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.680992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.674194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.604901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.534572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.524938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.41588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Syngenic","weight":0.395322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngenic"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.392364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin 21","weight":0.274393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_21"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.25158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
