{"id":92325,"title":"Inhibitory effect of icariin on Ti-induced inflammatory osteoclastogenesis.","abstract":"Wear particle-induced periprosthetic osteolysis that results in aseptic loosening is the most common cause of long-term failure after total joint replacement.Icariin (ICA), a flavonoid isolated from Epimedium pubescens, inhibits osteoclast formation, but its effects on wear particle-induced inflammatory osteoclastogenesis remains unclear. We investigated the role of ICA in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7), which is stimulated by titanium (Ti) particles and the receptor activator of NF-?B ligand.ICA effectively inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption in the differentiation medium. ICA (10(-7) mol/L) significantly reduced the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells compared with the control, and significantly reduced the percentage of the surface covered by resorption lacunae. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that ICA inhibited messenger RNA expression for the receptor activator of nuclear factor-?B, cathepsin K, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by Ti particles and receptor activator of NF-?B ligand. ICA also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression of interleukin-1? and tumor necrosis factor-? in RAW264.7 cells cultured with Ti particles. In addition, incubation with cholecystokinin-8 showed that ICA had no toxic effects on RAW264.7 cells.ICA possibly elicited inhibitory effects on inflammatory osteoclastogenesis induced by Ti particles, indicating that ICA may be useful for the prevention and treatment of wear particle-induced osteolysis.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Musculoskeletal
