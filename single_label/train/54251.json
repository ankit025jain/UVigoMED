{"id":54251,"title":"Resveratrol inhibits cisplatin-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer cell lines.","abstract":"Many patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer experience recurrence and metastasis, two aspects that will often cause their demise. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process involved in cancer progression. With increasing evidence linking Cisplatin and EMT, we wanted to identify a compound able to counter EMT progression when cancer cells are treated with Cisplatin.Cell death was evaluated by cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining in A2780 and A2780CP cells. Ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with Cisplatin (24 h, 10 ÂµM) and different concentrations of Resveratrol to evaluate its effect on Cisplatin-induced EMT using Western Blot and RT-PCR analysis. Morphological studies and wound healing assay to evaluate cell motility were performed using 72 h Cisplatin treatment with A2780 and A2780CP cells. Densitometry was done on Western Blot and PCR results, and statistical significance was determined using One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc test. Our results show that Cisplatin induced EMT-associated morphological changes in the A2780 ovarian cancer cell line and to a lesser extent in its Cisplatin-resistant counterpart A2780CP. Resveratrol caused cell death in A2780 and A2780CP cell lines in an apoptotic-independent manner. Resveratrol inhibited Cisplatin-induced Snail expression by reducing the Erk pathway activation, reverted morphological changes induced by Cisplatin and decreased cell migration.These results indicate that Resveratrol has interesting potential to prevent Cisplatin-induced EMT in ovarian cancer cells. By increasing cell death, it also represents an inviting approach as adjuvant therapy to be used with chemotherapy. Using Erk pathway inhibitors could also prove helpful in ovarian cancer treatment to reduce the risk of metastasis.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466305","annotations":[{"name":"Resveratrol","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.847192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.794437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.641092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.611853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.588002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.574824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.505938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
