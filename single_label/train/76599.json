{"id":76599,"title":"Malnutrition, overweight, and obesity among urban and rural children in north of west Azerbijan, Iran.","abstract":"Malnutrition is one of the most important causes for improper physical and mental development of children. Childhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem. The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity has become a growing matter of public health concern worldwide. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence of malnutrition and obesity in children under 5 years old in Salmas district.The current study is a cross-sectional study conducted on 902 of children under 5 years old to assess the nutritional status in Salmas district and performed from 16 until 30 October, 2011, with the cooperation of the Office of Community Nutrition Improvement and the United Nations Children's Fund. ENA (Emergency Nutrition Assessment) and Spss software were used for data analysis.49.6% of children were boys and 50.4% were girls. The prevalence of malnutrition based on underweight, stunting, and wasting was estimated to be 2.3%, 7.3%, and 1.4% among children, respectively. Stunting was more common in rural areas and this difference was significant (P < 0.001).In this area stunting, overweight and obesity were the most important priorities that health officials must pay more attention to. ENA software has a special ability to determine the samples and clusters and is a simple, rapid, and accurate method, especially in epidemiological studies in the country, and can be a convenient tool and its use is suggested for the same studies.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24971170","annotations":[{"name":"Iran","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"United Nations","weight":0.725578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"},{"name":"UNICEF","weight":0.71905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.710287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.69917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.598979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Azerbaijan","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.401155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.185378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.122266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Wasting","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasting"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
