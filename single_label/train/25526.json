{"id":25526,"title":"Surgical treatment of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm.","abstract":"Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rare condition because in most instances ventricular free-wall rupture leads to fatal pericardial tamponade. Rupture of the free wall of the left ventricle is a catastrophic complication of myocardial infarction, occurring in approximately 4% of patients with infarcts, resulting in immediate collapse of the patient and electromechanical dissociation. In rare cases the rupture is contained by pericardial and fibrous tissue, and the result is a pseudoaneurysm. The left ventricular pseudoaneurysm contains only pericardial and fibrous elements in its wall-no myocardial tissue. Because such aneurysms have a strong tendency to rupture, this disorder may lead to death if it is left surgically untreated.In this case report, we present a patient who underwent successful repair of a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm, which followed a myocardial infarction that was caused by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery. Although repair of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is still a surgical challenge, it can be performed with acceptable results in most patients.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195357","annotations":[{"name":"Circumflex branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.902179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cardiac tamponade","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_tamponade"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.533261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.456178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.432872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
