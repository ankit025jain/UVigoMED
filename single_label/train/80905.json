{"id":80905,"title":"Accuracy of the Kato-Katz method and formalin-ether concentration technique for the diagnosis of Clonorchis sinensis, and implication for assessing drug efficacy.","abstract":"Clonorchiasis is a chronic neglected disease caused by a liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of control and treatment efficacy is usually determined by microscopic examination of fecal samples. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the Kato-Katz method and the formalin-ether concentration technique (FECT) for C. sinensis diagnosis, and studied the effect of diagnostic approach on drug efficacy evaluation.Overall, 74 individuals aged ?18 years with a parasitological confirmed C. sinensis infection at baseline were re-examined 3 weeks after treatment. Before and after treatment, two stool samples were obtained from each participant and each sample was subjected to triplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and a single FECT examination.Thirty-eight individuals were still positive for C. sinensis according to our diagnostic 'gold' standard (six Kato-Katz thick smears plus two FECT). Two FECT had a significantly lower sensitivity than six Kato-Katz thick smears (44.7% versus 92.1%; p <0.001). Examination of single Kato-Katz and single FECT considerably overestimated cure rates.In settings where molecular diagnostic assays are absent, multiple Kato-Katz thick smears should be examined for an accurate diagnosis of C. sinensis infection and for assessing drug efficacy against this liver fluke infection.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499644","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.529832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.498923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Clonorchis sinensis","weight":0.495556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonorchis_sinensis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Trematoda","weight":0.317857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Liver fluke","weight":0.209541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_fluke"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Clonorchiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonorchiasis"},{"name":"Neglected diseases","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglected_diseases"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
