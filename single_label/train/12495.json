{"id":12495,"title":"Pre-clinical models of neurodevelopmental disorders: focus on the cerebellum.","abstract":"Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the role of the cerebellum in non-motor behaviors. Abnormalities in the cerebellar structure have been demonstrated to produce changes in emotional, cognitive, and social behaviors resembling clinical manifestations observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia. Several animal models have been used to evaluate the effects of relevant environmental and genetic risk factors on the cerebellum development and function. However, very few models of ASD and schizophrenia selectively target the cerebellum and/or specific cell types within this structure. In this review, we critically evaluate the strength and weaknesses of these models. We will propose that the future progress in this field will require time- and cell type-specific manipulations of disease-relevant genes, not only selectively in the cerebellum, but also in frontal brain areas connected with the cerebellum. Such information can advance our knowledge of the cerebellar contribution to non-motor behaviors in mental health and disease.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523305","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.712861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.640585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.52,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.457582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.407291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0979663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0266732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Neurodevelopmental disorder","weight":0.0134987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodevelopmental_disorder"}]}
