{"id":81943,"title":"[Mumps vaccine virus transmission].","abstract":"In this work we report the mumps vaccine virus shedding based on the laboratory confirmed cases of the mumps virus (MuV) infection. The likely epidemiological sources of the transmitted mumps virus were children who were recently vaccinated with the mumps vaccine containing Leningrad-Zagreb or Leningrad-3 MuV. The etiology of the described cases of the horizontal transmission of both mumps vaccine viruses was confirmed by PCR with the sequential restriction analysis.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772647","annotations":[{"name":"Horizontal transmission","weight":0.822455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_transmission"},{"name":"Mumps","weight":0.810987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.801571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Viral shedding","weight":0.772537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Mumps virus","weight":0.261252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps_virus"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mumps vaccine","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps_vaccine"},{"name":"Restriction digest","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_digest"},{"name":"Saint Petersburg","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"}]}
