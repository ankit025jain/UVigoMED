{"id":43379,"title":"[Effectiveness and safety of endoscopic ultrasound-guided transgastric or transpapillary drainage in treating pancreatic pseudocyst].","abstract":"To explore the effectiveness and safety of endoscopic transgastric or transpapillary drainage in treating pancreatic pseudocysts.The clinical data of 15 patients with pancreatic pseudocyst who underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided transgastric or transpapillary drainage in the Chinese PLA General Hospital between June 2004 and February 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Also, we reviewed the relevant Chinese literature in the China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (from 1994 to 2012) and VIP China Science and Technology Journal Database (from 1989 to 2012) using the key words \"pancreatic pseudocyst and drainage\". Five literatures including 103 cases were enrolled.The data of 118 cases undergoing endoscopic drainage, included 94 cases with transgastric approach and 24 with transpapillary approach, entered the final analysis. The success rate was 94.9%, and cysts completely disappeared in 83.9% of the patients. The overall incidence of complications (bleeding, infection, and stent clogging or migration) was 19.5%. One patient lost to follow-up and only one case of recurrence was noted.Endoscopic transgastric or transpapillary drainage is safe and effective in treating the pancreatic pseudocysts and therefore can be a preferred therapeutic approach.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791802","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.642762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.531894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chinese literature","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_literature"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.270877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.14466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.118291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"People's Liberation Army","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Pancreatic pseudocyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_pseudocyst"},{"name":"Pseudocyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocyst"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1989","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Clogging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clogging"},{"name":"Keyword (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_(linguistics)"},{"name":"1994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Very Important Person","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Important_Person"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"}]}
