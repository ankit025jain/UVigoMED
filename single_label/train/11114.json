{"id":11114,"title":"High-mobility group box 1 inhibition alleviates lupus-like disease in BXSB mice.","abstract":"High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a ubiquitous nuclear DNA-binding protein, functions as a potent proinflammatory factor. In this study, we evaluated the effects of HMGB1 inhibition on murine lupus using the lupus-prone model. We treated male BXSB mice with neutralizing anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (HMGB1 mAb) from age 16 weeks to 26 weeks. The control group received the same amount of control IgG. Lupus-prone male BXSB mice treated with HMGB1mAb showed attenuated proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, circulating anti-dsDNA and immune complex deposition. Levels of serum IL-1?, IL-6, IL-17 and IL-18 were also significantly decreased by administration of HMGB1mAb in lupus-prone BXSB mice. HMGB1mAb treatment also decreased the caspase-1 activity in the kidneys of BXSB mice and reduced the mouse mortality. Our study supports that HMGB1 inhibition alleviates lupus-like disease in BXSB mice and might be a potential treatment option for human SLE.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612327","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.891597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Immune complex","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_complex"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.826105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Glomerulonephritis","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.754147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.681947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.450122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.405451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.368885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Interleukin 18","weight":0.306457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_18"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"HMGB1","weight":0.20897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGB1"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"}]}
