{"id":47045,"title":"Monoamine oxidase A suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by inhibiting the adrenergic system and its transactivation of EGFR signaling.","abstract":"Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a catecholamine neurotransmitter degrading enzyme, is closely associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, its role in cancer progression remains unknown.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue arrays (n=254) were used to investigate the correlation between MAOA expression and clinicopathological findings. In vitro invasion and anoikis assays, and in vivo intrahepatic and lung metastasis models were used to determine the role of MAOA in HCC metastasis. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemical staining and HPLC analysis were performed to uncover the mechanism of MAOA in HCC.We found that MAOA expression was significantly downregulated in 254 clinical HCC samples and was closely correlated with cancer vasoinvasion, metastasis, and poor prognoses. We then demonstrated that MAOA suppressed norepinephrine/epinephrine (NE/E)-induced HCC invasion and anoikis inhibition, and uncovered that the effects of NE/E on HCC behaviors were primarily mediated through alpha 1A (ADRA1A) and beta 2 adrenergic receptors (ADRB2). In addition to the canonical signaling pathway, which is mediated via adrenergic receptors (ADRs), we found that ADR-mediated EGFR transactivation was also involved in NE-induced HCC invasion and anoikis inhibition. Notably, we found that MAOA could synergize with EGFR inhibitors or ADR antagonists to abrogate NE-induced HCC behaviors.Taken together, the results of our study may provide insights into the application of MAOA as a novel predictor of clinical outcomes and indicate that increasing MAOA expression or enzyme activity may be a new approach that can be used for HCC treatment.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System
