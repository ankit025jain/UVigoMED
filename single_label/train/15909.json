{"id":15909,"title":"Analysis of validamycin as a potential antifungal compound against Candida albicans.","abstract":"Validamycin A has been successfully applied in the fight against phytopathogenic fungi. Here, the putative antifungal effect of this pseudooligosaccharide against the prevalent human pathogen Candida albicans was examined. Validamycin A acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of the cell-wall-linked acid trehalase (Atc1p). The estimated MIC50 for the C. albicans parental strain CEY.1 was 500 mg/l. The addition of doses below MIC50 to exponentially growing CEY.1 cells caused a slight reduction in cell growth. A concentration of 1 mg/ml was required to achieve a significant degree of cell killing. The compound was stable as evidenced by the increased reduction of cell growth with increasing incubation time. A homozygous atc1delta/atc1delta mutant lacking functional Atc1p activity showed greater resistance to the drug. The antifungal power of validamycin A was limited compared with the drastic lethal action caused by exposure to amphotericin B. The endogenous content of trehalose rose significantly upon validamycin and amphotericin B addition. Neither serum-induced hypha formation nor the level of myceliation recorded in macroscopic colonies were affected by exposure to validamycin A. Our results suggest that, although validamycin A cannot be considered a clinically useful antifungal against C. albicans, its mechanism of action and antifungal properties provide the basis for designing new, clinically interesting, antifungal-related compounds.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102722","annotations":[{"name":"Hypha","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.875066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.79047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Trehalose","weight":0.780195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trehalose"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Plant pathology","weight":0.764018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_pathology"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.710199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.641668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Competitive inhibition","weight":0.636722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_inhibition"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.633441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.443034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.235094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.120224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0550013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Colony (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"}]}
