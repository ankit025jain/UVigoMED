{"id":37909,"title":"T-bar reconstruction of constricted ears and a new classification.","abstract":"For the correction of constricted ears, many techniques are described in the literature, the majority based on Tanzer's classification of 1975. The improvements in ear reconstruction published by Brent, Nagata, Firmin and Park make better outcomes possible. It is therefore that a new classification for constricted ears is proposed, together with an alternative technique for correction of group IIA and IIB deformities, using a T-strut of costal cartilage to reconstruct the underdeveloped or missing superior crus of the antihelix.
