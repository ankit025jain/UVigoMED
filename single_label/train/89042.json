{"id":89042,"title":"[Neuroanatomical basis for traumatic coma: clinical and magnetic resonance correlates].","abstract":"In this paper, the relationship between brain lesion localization (verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and the severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its outcomes is presented. Magnetic resonance studies in different modes (T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, DTI, T2 * GRE, SWAN) were performed in 162 patients with acute TBI. Statistical analysis was done using Statistica 6, 8 software and R programming language. A new advanced MRI-based classification of TBI was introduced implying the assessment of hemispheric and brainstem traumatic lesions level and localization. Statistically significant correlations were found between the Glasgow coma and outcome scales scores (p < 0.001), and the proposed MRI grading scale scores, which means a high prognostic value of the new classification. The knowledge of injured brain microanatomy coming from sensitive neuroimaging, in conjunction with the assessment of mechanisms, aggravating factors and clinical manifestation of brain trauma is the basis for the actual predictive model of TBI. The proposed advanced MRI classification contributes to this concept development.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Wounds and
