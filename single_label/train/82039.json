{"id":82039,"title":"Sialometry of upper labial minor glands: a clinical approach by the use of weighing method Schirmer's test strips paper.","abstract":"To establish referential values ranges of hyposalivation and normosalivation for the salivary flow rate (SFR) of upper labial (LS) and palatal (PS) mucosa using Schirmer's test strips paper and as a second goal to determine the values ranges of the SFR of palatal (PS) and upper labial (LS) mucosa in subjects with and without xerostomia.A cross-sectional study was conducted among subjects distributed in three groups according to their unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva.144 subjects were enrolled in groups as follows: severe hyposalivation (n = 24), mild hyposalivation (n = 78), and normosalivation (n = 42). The mean and the 95% confidence interval for the LS flow rate ( ? L/cm(2)/min) were 3.2 (2.46 to 3.94), 5.86 (4.96 to 6.75), and 9.08 (7.63 to 10.53) (P < 0.001) for each group, respectively. The PS results were 1.01 (0.68 to 1.34), 1.72 (1.31 to 2.13), and 2.44 (1.66 to 3.22) (P = 0.014). Xerostomia complainers presented lower rates of LS (5.17 (4.06 to 6.23)) than non-complainers (7.33 (6.4 to 8.27)) (P = 0.003).The test was reliable to provide referential values ranges for LS flow rate measurement and was shown to be valid to distinguish normosalivation from severe and mild hyposalivation and also to predict xerostomia.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24737963","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"SFR","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFR"},{"name":"Alias (season 5)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(season_5)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"The Summer Bummer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Summer_Bummer"},{"name":"Reference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference"},{"name":"Supralabial scale","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supralabial_scale"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
