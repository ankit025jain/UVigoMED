{"id":31862,"title":"[Clinical outcomes in the first year of life of premature infants].","abstract":"The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate clinical outcomes of the first year of life of premature infants discharged from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) based on mortality and readmission data, and the motor development of the children. The sample consisted of 170 children with gestational age under 37 weeks and who survived hospitalization in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Data were collected from medical records, the hospital IT system and telephone interview with the caregiver. The authors found 100% survival during the study period and that 39.4% of the infants were often readmitted (26.5%) due to respiratory conditions. Their development was considered as expected, when using the corrected age. In conclusion, the premature infants from this study showed good clinical evolution of the proposed observation.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080696","annotations":[{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.722717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.62554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.197065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
