{"id":30946,"title":"[The study of naphthyzin present in material evidence and biological fluids].","abstract":"The optimal conditions for isolation of naphazoline from naphthyzin preparations and biological fluids with chloroform at pH 9.18 are described. The compound of interest was identified with the use of color and precipitation reactions, IR and UV spectroscopy, thin-layer and gas chromatography, and chemical methods including high performance liquid chromatography, chromatodensitometry, and UV spectroscopy. The results obtained by the three methods are comparable.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432425","annotations":[{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Chloroform","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.710751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Body fluid","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid"},{"name":"Precipitation (meteorology)","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"UV spectroscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_spectroscopy"}]}
