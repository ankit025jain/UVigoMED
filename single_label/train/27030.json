{"id":27030,"title":"Cardiovascular risks in Kazakh population in Xinjiang Province of China.","abstract":"Assess the cardiovascular risks in Kazakh population in Ili of Xinjiang Province.A total of 1126 participants (M/F: 443/683) aged > or = 35 years, living in Ili for more than five years were selected via stratified random sampling. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), blood lipids, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure (BP) were measured. The risk was evaluated by 10-year risk estimation of ischemic cardiovascular disease (ICVD) in Chinese.The mean values of systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index (BMI), blood lipids were significantly higher in male than female (P < .01). The mean value (%) of 10-year morbid risk was higher in males than females aged < 50 years (P < .05). A 10-year absolute risk of ICVD was < 10% (P = .536) in 94.8% of males and 95.6% of females. The ratio of high-risk population (20%-40%) was higher in males than females (2.93% vs .73%, P = .004). There was significant difference in SBP, total cholesterol, and BMI among high, moderate, and low risk groups (P < .05).Our study shows a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risks in the Kazakh population. Immediate short-term and sustainable long-term programs should be carried out to prevent the morbidity caused by known preventable risk factors.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065073","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.864015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"China","weight":0.693187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.681221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.364378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Xinjiang","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.345586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.34302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Kazakhstan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Absolute risk reduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_risk_reduction"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"}]}
