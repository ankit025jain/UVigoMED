{"id":74030,"title":"Three-dimensional virtual reality simulation of periarticular tumors using Dextroscope reconstruction and simulated surgery: a preliminary 10 case study.","abstract":"Dextroscope three-dimensional (3D) imaging has been extensively applied for generation of virtual reality (VR) workspaces for in neurosurgery and laparoscopy, though few applications in orthopedic surgery have been reported. Patients undergoing surgery for periarticular tumors (n = 10) from Oct. 2008 to Jun. 2010 were enrolled and presurgically subjected to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MRI angiography (MRI-A). Imaging data was transferred and integrated in Dextroscope, producing a VR simulation. Resultant presurgical 3D anatomical reconstructions and intraoperative anatomical characteristics (virtual vs. actual data) and surgical approach (virtual vs. actual situation) measurement and subjective appearance were compared. Anatomical characteristics in the area of interest and tumor diameters were consistent between virtual and actual data. However, the virtual surgical situations remained inconsistent with the actual intraoperative situation in many cases, leading to complications. The resolution of original CT, MRI, and MRI-A images directly correlated with the quality of 3D simulations, with soft tissues most poorly represented. Tumor tissue imaging quality in 3D varied extensively by tumor type.Anatomical structures of periarticular tumors can be reconstructed using the Dextroscope system with good accuracy in the case of simple fenestration, increasing individualization of treatment, surgical competence level, and potentially reducing intraoperative complications. However, further specialization of VR tools for use in orthopedic applications that involve specialized tools and procedures, such as drilling and implant placement, are urgently required.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873098","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance
