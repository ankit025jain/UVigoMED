{"id":45195,"title":"PRL-3 and E-cadherin show mutual interactions and participate in lymph node metastasis formation in gastric cancer.","abstract":"E-cadherin, a transmembrane adhesion molecule, and phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL-3) protein, a member of the family of tyrosine phosphatases, seem to be responsible for cancer cell migration. Therefore, the study objective was to determine a correlation between PRL-3 and E-cadherin, to assess their expression in neoplastic tissue and normal mucosa of the stomach, to analyze their effect on cancer advancement, and to evaluate their potential as prognostic markers in gastric cancer. The expressions of PRL-3 and E-cadherin were assessed immunohistochemically in 71 patients with gastric cancer. Positive expression of PRL-3 was observed in 42.2 % of gastric cancer cases, whereas E-cadherin expression was abnormal in 38 % of cases. The study revealed that the positive PRL-3 expression and abnormal E-cadherin expression were associated with mucinous gastric carcinoma and lymph node involvement. The former was also related to the infiltrating type of tumor and abnormal E-cadherin expression. The expression of PRL-3, but not of E-cadherin, was associated with shorter survival of patients. PRL-3 and E-cadherin exhibit interactions in gastric cancer and are involved in the formation of lymph node metastases. The PRL-3 protein can be an independent predictive factor of overall survival in gastric cancer patients.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696260","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.741936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.664861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.476424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.473824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.442299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Transmembrane protein","weight":0.431014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.422464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.200046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Protein tyrosine phosphatase","weight":0.184771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tyrosine_phosphatase"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
