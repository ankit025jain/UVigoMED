{"id":32136,"title":"[Nicolò Paganini: Devil's violinist because of abnormal hands?--New investigations using a bronze cast from the right hand].","abstract":"This paper presents new measurements of a bronze cast from the right hand of the famous Italian violin virtuoso Nicolò Paganini (1782-1840). These are compared to anthropometric standard values. In addition, detailed dorsal and palmar views of the cast are shown. With a middle finger length of 75 mm, the palm width is 60 mm and the hand length 152 mm, which is significantly below the 5% percentile of today's standard values. Also the finger length index (0.55), the ratio of finger length to palm length (0.98) and the ratio of finger length to palm width (1.25) are significantly above normal limits. Hence, Paganini had abnormal hand measurements with a very small palm and relatively \"long\" fingers. This remarkable constellation, among others, could have been advantageous for his amazing skills as a violinist.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25004620","annotations":[{"name":"Italy","weight":0.760617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Violin","weight":0.489627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Bronze","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.190525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Constellation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Arecaceae","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Devil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Finger (gesture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(gesture)"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75_mm_Gun_M2/M3/M6"},{"name":"Nicol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol"},{"name":"Paganini","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganini"},{"name":"Virtuoso","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/152_mm_howitzer_M1938_(M-10)"},{"name":"Middle finger","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_finger"}]}
