{"id":4261,"title":"[Evaluating risk of health disorders in workers engaged into polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride and caustic soda production (according to data collected by polls)].","abstract":"The authors represent data of automated system for quantitative risk evaluation of main pathologic syndromes in workers engaged into polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride and caustic soda production. Vinyl chloride and mercury levels at the investigation time corresponded with MAC. Relationship was seen between value of arterial hypertension risk and duration of contact with both vinyl chloride and mercury. Risk values for functional disorders of liver, endocrine system and nervous system were in weak correlation with length of exposure to mercury at work. Workers exposed to mercury appeared to have lower self-estimation of health state and higher dissatisfaction with the work.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335423","annotations":[{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.871478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.821865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.737935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polyvinyl chloride","weight":0.588317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.447954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.314633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Soft drink","weight":0.294477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink"},{"name":"Sodium hydroxide","weight":0.276152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide"},{"name":"Corrosive substance","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosive_substance"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mercury poisoning","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Vinyl chloride","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyl_chloride"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Vinyl","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyl"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Functional disorder","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_disorder"}]}
