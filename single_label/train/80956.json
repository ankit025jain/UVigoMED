{"id":80956,"title":"[Survey of distribution of Enterobius vermicularis infection of children in Huadu District, Guangzhou City].","abstract":"To understand the status of Enterobius vermicularis infection of children in Huadu District, Guangzhou City so as to provide the evidence for improving the control work.In 2012, 24 kindergartens and 24 primary schools were selected as survey sites by the stratified random sampling method and 200 or more children aged below 10 years per site were investigated for the Enterobius vermicularis infection by the cellophane tape method. The relevant influencing factors (environment conditions, sanitary facilities and management system, and health habits of families and individuals) were surveyed with questionnaire, and all the data were analyzed statistically with the Excel software.From September to December, 2012, totally 9 777 children were investigated and 760 ones were detected with Enterobius vermicularis infection (7.77%). With a school as the unit, the highest infection rate reached to 33.82% (69/204). The infection rate in urban areas was 4.63% (195/ 4 213), and the rate in villages was 10.15% (760/5 546) ( chi2 =102.126, P <0.01). The infection rate of preschool children was 3.51% (1 70/4 840) and the rate of school children was 11.95% (590/4 973), and the latter was much higher than the former (chi2 =242.732, P < 0.01). The infection rates of the male and the female were 7.44% (412/5 537) and 8.21% (348/4, 240) respectively ( chi2 = 1.969, P > 0.05). The survey of relevant influencing factors showed that the conditions of the kindergartens were better than those in the primary schools, and the conditions in the urban areas were better than those in the villages.The Enterobius vermicularis infection of children in Huadu District is high. The control key points should be put on the schools with poor sanitary facilities and environment conditions in villages and urban areas.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic
