{"id":36652,"title":"miRNA expression analysis in cortical dysplasia: regulation of mTOR and LIS1 pathway.","abstract":"Cortical dysplasia (CD) is a common cause of epilepsy in children and is characterized by focal regions of malformed cerebral cortex. The pathogenesis and epileptogenesis of CD have not been fully elucidated, and in particular, the potential role of epigenetics has not been examined. miRNA microarray was performed on surgical specimens from CD (n=8) and normal control (n=2) children. A total of 10 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) that were up-regulated in CD were identified including hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-155. The microarray results were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. After searching for the putative target genes of the DEmiRs, their biological significance was further evaluated by exploring the pathways in which the genes were enriched. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was the most significantly associated, and the pathway of lissencephaly gene in neuronal migration and development was also noted. This study suggests a possible role for miRNAs in the pathogenesis of CD, especially in relation to the mTOR signaling pathway. Future studies on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying CD pathogenesis and epileptogenesis are needed.
