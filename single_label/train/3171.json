{"id":3171,"title":"Hematologic issues in the geriatric surgical patient.","abstract":"Geriatric patients are at higher risk for hemorrhagic complications after surgery and traumatic injuries. The geriatric population is more likely to take anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications. Chronic disease, autoimmune disease, and nutritional deficiencies can lead to coagulation factor and platelet disorders. One must be familiar with the current anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications, their mechanism of action, and reversal agents to properly care for this group of patients. The new oral anticoagulants do not have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved reversal agents, but known procoagulant agents with other FDA indications may be effective.
