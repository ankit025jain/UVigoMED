{"id":64504,"title":"Association of MDR1 C3435T and RFC1 G80A polymorphisms with methotrexate toxicity and response in Jordanian rheumatoid arthritis patients.","abstract":"Methotrexate (MTX) is the most commonly used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Genetic polymorphisms of reduced folate carrier (RFC1 G80A) and multi-drug resistance-1 (MDR1 C3435T) might affect MTX response and/or toxicity. The aim of this study was to find out if there is an association between those polymorphisms and MTX toxicity and/or response in Jordanian RA patients.A genotyping approach was used to determine the studied polymorphisms in 159 RA patients.There was an association between RFC1 G80A and MDR1 C3435T polymorphisms with MTX toxicity. Patients with RFC1 80GG genotype were at higher risk for gastrointestinal toxicity (p = 0.036). Patients carrying at least one MDR1 3435T variant allele were at higher risk for MTX overall toxicity (p = 0.04), especially hepatotoxicity (p = 0.028). Furthermore, the distribution of RFC1 G80A polymorphism between males and females was significantly different. The variant genotype 80AA was found to be more in males than in females (60% vs. 31%) (p = 0.011).Our results suggest that genetic polymorphisms in methotrexate transporters affect the toxicity but not the response of MTX treatment. Further studies should be performed to have more conclusive results.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074866","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.933358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.902076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.806779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.741545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.731786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.650458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.55494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"SNP genotyping","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP_genotyping"},{"name":"Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug","weight":0.355557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease-modifying_antirheumatic_drug"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"RFC1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC1"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"GeForce 8 Series","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_8_Series"},{"name":"Jordan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Request for Comments","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
