{"id":79094,"title":"Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa executive summary.","abstract":"The American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 8 recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE) and the use of oral and topical antimicrobials and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492208","annotations":[{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.909966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.742497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.58743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.370534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.111102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Alberta Order of Excellence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Order_of_Excellence"},{"name":"Otitis externa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_externa"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Executive (government)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Executive summary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_summary"}]}
