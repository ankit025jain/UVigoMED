{"id":28256,"title":"Implementation of a collaborative care management program with buprenorphine in primary care: a comparison between opioid-dependent patients and patients with chronic pain using opioids nonmedically.","abstract":"To implement a collaborative care management program with buprenorphine in a primary care clinic.Prospective observational study.A busy urban academic primary care clinic affiliated with a tertiary care hospital.Opioid-dependent patients or patients with chronic pain using opioids nonmedically were recruited for the study. A total of 45 participants enrolled.Patients were treated with buprenorphine and managed by a supervising psychiatrist, pharmacist care manager, and health coaches. The care manager conducted buprenorphine inductions and all follow-up visits. Health coaches offered telephonic support. The psychiatrist supervised both the care manager and health coaches.Primary outcomes were treatment retention at 6 months, and change in the proportion of aberrant toxicology results and opioid craving scores from baseline to 6 months. After data collection, clinical outcomes were compared between opioid-dependent patients and patients with chronic pain using opioids nonmedically. Overall, 55.0 percent of participants (25/45) remained in treatment at 6 months. Primary care physicians (PCPs)' attitudes about opioid dependence treatment were surveyed at baseline and at 18 months.Forty-three patients (95.6 percent) accepted treatment and 25 (55.0 percent) remained in treatment at 6 months. The proportion of aberrant urine toxicology results decreased significantly from baseline to 6 months (p < 0.01). Craving scores significantly decreased from baseline to 6 months (p < 0.01). Opioid-dependent patients, as opposed to patients with chronic pain using opioids nonmedically, were significantly more likely to complete 6 months of treatment (p < 0.05). PCPs' confidence in treating opioid dependence in primary care increased significantly from baseline to 18 months postimplementation (p < 0.01).Collaborative care management for opioid dependence with buprenorphine may be feasible in a primary care clinic. More research is needed to understand the role of buprenorphine in managing patients with chronic pain using opioids nonmedically.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24944066","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Psychiatrist","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.74513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.643436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.548787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.545403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.362795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.354654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.352329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.302397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Primary care physician","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician"},{"name":"Buprenorphine","weight":0.115579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Coach (sport)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Chronic care management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_care_management"}]}
