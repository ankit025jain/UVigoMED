{"id":60382,"title":"[Blue baby syndrome: the source of the truth].","abstract":"Methemoglobinemia is a rare disorder preferentially affecting children. The outcome may be dramatic when the disorder remains unidentified, however early recognition using unspecific exams allows prompt therapy. We report the case of a 14-month-old baby who presented with a sudden access of cyanosis resulting from acute methemoglobinemia. Careful investigation identified contamination of familial food by an excess of nitrates related to the use of well water from rural location.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923096","annotations":[{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.476917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.383887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.370166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.342639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Methemoglobinemia","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobinemia"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Nitrate","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate"},{"name":"Water well","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_well"},{"name":"Blue baby syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_baby_syndrome"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Truth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth"}]}
