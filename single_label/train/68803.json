{"id":68803,"title":"Family history of cancer and gastroesophageal disorders and risk of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas: a case-control study.","abstract":"There is a paucity of data on familial risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and distal gastric adenocarcinoma from population-based studies.A population-based case-control study of newly diagnosed gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma was conducted in Los Angeles County. This analysis included data of case-patients whom we were able to interview directly (147 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, 182 with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, and 285 with distal gastric adenocarcinoma) and 1,309 control participants. Multivariate polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the three cancer types.Risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was positively associated with a family history of prostate cancer (OR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.50-5.36) and a family history of hiatal hernia (OR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.12-3.71). Risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma was strongly associated with a family history of esophageal cancer (OR = 5.18; 95% CI = 1.23-21.79) and a family history of hiatal hernia (OR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.37-3.91). Risk of distal gastric adenocarcinoma was positively associated with a family history of gastric cancer (OR = 2.15; 95% CI = 1.18-3.91), particularly early-onset (before age 50) gastric cancer (OR = 2.82; 95% CI = 1.11-7.15).This study provides evidence that family history of hiatal hernia is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and that cancer in specific sites is associated with risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, and distal gastric adenocarcinoma. It is important to determine the extent to which shared environmental and genetic factors explain these familial associations.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495377","annotations":[{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.651311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.588761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.325646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.303715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.249865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.247559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0726324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Los Angeles County, California","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California"},{"name":"Hiatus hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_hernia"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Polytomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytomy"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"285","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"The New Era","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Era"},{"name":"'Allo 'Allo!
