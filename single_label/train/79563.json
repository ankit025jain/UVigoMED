{"id":79563,"title":"Soil-transmitted helminths in pre-school-aged and school-aged children in an urban slum: a cross-sectional study of prevalence, distribution, and associated exposures.","abstract":"Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are controlled by regular mass drug administration. Current practice targets school-age children (SAC) preferentially over pre-school age children (PSAC) and treats large areas as having uniform prevalence. We assessed infection prevalence in SAC and PSAC and spatial infection heterogeneity, using a cross-sectional study in two slum villages in Kibera, Nairobi. Nairobi has low reported STH prevalence. The SAC and PSAC were randomly selected from the International Emerging Infections Program's surveillance platform. Data included residence location and three stools tested by Kato-Katz for STHs. Prevalences among 692 analyzable children were any STH: PSAC 40.5%, SAC 40.7%; Ascaris: PSAC 24.1%, SAC 22.7%; Trichuris: PSAC 24.0%, SAC 28.8%; hookworm < 0.1%. The STH infection prevalence ranged from 22% to 71% between sub-village sectors. The PSAC have similar STH prevalences to SAC and should receive deworming. Small areas can contain heterogeneous prevalences; determinants of STH infection should be characterized and slums should be assessed separately in STH mapping.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25157123","annotations":[{"name":"Deworming","weight":0.437638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deworming"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Slum","weight":0.218346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slum"},{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Nairobi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi"},{"name":"Kibera","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibera"},{"name":"Mass drug administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_drug_administration"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"692","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/692"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Trichuris","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Strategic Air Command","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Athletic_Conference"}]}
