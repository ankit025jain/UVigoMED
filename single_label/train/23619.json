{"id":23619,"title":"Multiplex high-resolution melting analysis as a diagnostic tool for detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC ?-lactamase genes.","abstract":"High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis can be a diagnostic tool to evaluate the presence of resistance genes with the added bonus of discriminating sequence modifications. A real-time, multiplex PCR assay using HRM was designed for the detection of plasmid-mediated ampC genes. The specificity and sensitivity of this assay were 96% and 100%, respectively.
