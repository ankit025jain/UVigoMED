{"id":3597,"title":"Event detection by feature unpredictability in phase-contrast videos of cell cultures.","abstract":"In this work we propose a novel framework for generic event monitoring in live cell culture videos, built on the assumption that unpredictable observations should correspond to biological events. We use a small set of event-free data to train a multioutput multikernel Gaussian process model that operates as an event predictor by performing autoregression on a bank of heterogeneous features extracted from consecutive frames of a video sequence. We show that the prediction error of this model can be used as a probability measure of the presence of relevant events, that can enable users to perform further analysis or monitoring of large-scale non-annotated data. We validate our approach in two phase-contrast sequence data sets containing mitosis and apoptosis events: a new private dataset of human bone cancer (osteosarcoma) cells and a benchmark dataset of stem cells.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485374","annotations":[{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.959338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell
