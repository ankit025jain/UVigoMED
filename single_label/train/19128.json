{"id":19128,"title":"Targeting Staphylococcus aureus ?-toxin as a novel approach to reduce severity of recurrent skin and soft-tissue infections.","abstract":"Staphyococcus aureus frequently causes recurrent skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI). In the pediatric population, elevated serum antibody targeting S. aureus ?-toxin is correlated with a reduced incidence of recurrent SSTI. Using a novel model of recurrent SSTI, we demonstrated that expression of ?-toxin during primary infection increases the severity of recurrent disease. Antagonism of ?-toxin by either a dominant-negative toxin mutant or a small molecule inhibitor of the toxin receptor ADAM10 during primary infection reduces reinfection abscess severity. Early neutralization of ?-toxin activity during S. aureus SSTI therefore offers a new therapeutic strategy to mitigate primary and recurrent disease.
