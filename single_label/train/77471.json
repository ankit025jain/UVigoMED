{"id":77471,"title":"Black Lung Benefits Act: standards for chest radiographs. Final rule.","abstract":"Physicians and adjudicators use chest radiographs (X-rays) as a tool in evaluating whether a coal miner suffers from pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Accordingly, the Department's regulations implementing the Black Lung Benefits Act allow the submission of radiographs in connection with benefit claims and set out quality standards for administering and interpreting film-based chest radiographs. This final rule updates the Department's existing film-radiograph standards and provides parallel standards for digital radiographs. This rule also updates outdated terminology and removes certain obsolete provisions.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741754","annotations":[{"name":"Coal mining","weight":0.814578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining"},{"name":"Coal","weight":0.414053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.32574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pneumoconiosis","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumoconiosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.214493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Miner","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miner"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Coalworker's pneumoconiosis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalworker's_pneumoconiosis"},{"name":"Black Lung Benefits Act of 1973","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lung_Benefits_Act_of_1973"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Terminology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Professional wrestling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"},{"name":"Adjudication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjudication"},{"name":"Obsolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsolescence"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"}]}
