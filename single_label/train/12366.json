{"id":12366,"title":"The transcription factors T-bet and Runx are required for the ontogeny of pathogenic interferon-?-producing T helper 17 cells.","abstract":"T helper 17 (Th17) cells can give rise to interleukin-17A (IL-17A)- and interferon (IFN)-?-double-producing cells that are implicated in development of autoimmune diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern generation of IFN-?-producing Th17 cells are unclear. We found that coexpression of the Th1 and Th17 cell master transcription factors, T-bet and retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma-t (ROR?t), respectively, did not generate Th cells with robust IL-17 and IFN-? expression. Instead, development of IFN-?-producing Th17 cells required T-bet and Runx1 or Runx3. IL-12-stimulated Th17 cells upregulated Runx1, which bound to the Ifng locus in a T-bet-dependent manner. Reciprocally, T-bet or Runx1 deficiency or inhibition of Runx transcriptional activity impaired the development of IFN-?-producing Th17 cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which correlated with substantially ameliorated disease course. Thus, our studies identify a critical role for T-bet and Runx transcription factors in the generation of pathogenic IFN-?-producing Th17 cells.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530058","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.878077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.769935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.485739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.477054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Ontogeny","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogeny"},{"name":"Orphan receptor","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_receptor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.160357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_autoimmune_encephalomyelitis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Encephalomyelitis","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalomyelitis"},{"name":"Orphan","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan"}]}
