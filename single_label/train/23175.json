{"id":23175,"title":"Comparison of Tesio and LifeCath twin permanent hemodialysis catheters: the VyTes randomized trial.","abstract":"Central venous catheters for maintenance hemodialysis (HD) are designed to attain the required dialysis dose through sustained high blood flow rates (BFR). The authors studied the immediate and long-term performance and complications of two twin-catheter systems, the Tesio catheter (TC) and the LifeCath Twin (LC), to inform clinical practice.This single-center randomized controlled parallel-group trial allocated 80 incident patients (1:1) to receive either a TC (MedComp) or LC (Vygon). Patients were dialyzed to target BFR 450 mL/min and followed up for 12 months. The primary outcome was achievement of target BFR during the first HD session. Secondary outcomes included thrombotic dysfunction, displacement and catheter-related infection. Catheter dysfunction was defined by a BFR ? 250 mL/min.More LCs reached the primary endpoint (44% vs. 10%, p=0.001) delivering a higher BFR (mean 383±82 vs. 277±79 mL/min, p<0.001). Significant differences in BFR persisted until the fourth dialysis session. Rates of catheter-related bacteremia (0.40 vs. 0.51/1,000 catheter days, p=0.7) and exit site infection were similar between groups (0.24 vs. 0.09/1,000 catheter days, p=0.4). Overall rates of catheter dysfunction were 2.8/1,000 catheter days (95% CI 2.1-3.5), with no differences in thrombolytic lock use although the LC group required more thrombolytic infusions (6 vs. 0, p=0.01).The LC can deliver greater BFRs in the first three HD sessions following insertion although this did not translate into differences in performance, dialysis adequacy or complication rates with long-term use. Both catheter types can consistently deliver high BFRs over an extended period of time.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24500851","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.826282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Lock (water transport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(water_transport)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Brominated flame retardant","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brominated_flame_retardant"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Macintosh LC","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Magnum Research BFR","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_Research_BFR"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"}]}
