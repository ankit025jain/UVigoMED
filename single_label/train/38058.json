{"id":38058,"title":"Predicting transepithelial phototherapeutic keratectomy outcomes using Fourier domain optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to use Fourier domain optical coherence tomography to predict transepithelial phototherapeutic keratectomy outcomes.This is a prospective case series. Subjects with anterior stromal corneal opacities underwent an excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) combined with a photorefractive keratectomy using the VISX S4 excimer laser (AMO, Inc, Santa Ana, CA). Preoperative and postoperative Fourier domain optical coherence tomography images were used to develop a simulation algorithm to predict treatment outcomes. Main outcome measures included preoperative and postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuities and corrected distance visual acuity.Nine eyes of 8 patients were treated. The nominal ablation depth was 75 to 177 ?m centrally and 62 to 185 ?m peripherally. Measured PTK ablation depths were 20% higher centrally and 26% higher peripherally, compared with those for laser settings. Postoperatively, the mean uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/41 (range, 20/25-20/80) compared with 20/103 (range, 20/60-20/400) preoperatively. The mean corrected distance visual acuity was 20/29 (range, 20/15-20/60) compared with 20/45 (range, 20/30-20/80) preoperatively. The MRSE was +1.38 ± 2.37 diopters (D) compared with -2.59 ± 2.83 D (mean ± SD). The mean astigmatism magnitude was 1.14 ± 0.83 D compared with 1.40 ± 1.18 D preoperatively. Postoperative MRSE correlated strongly with ablation settings, central and peripheral epithelial thickness (r = 0.99, P < 0.00001). Central islands remained difficult to predict and limited visual outcomes in some cases.Optical coherence tomography measurements of opacity depth and 3-dimensional ablation simulation provide valuable guidance in PTK planning. Post-PTK refraction may be predicted with a regression formula that uses epithelial thickness measurements obtained by optical coherence tomography. The laser ablation rates described in this study apply only to the VISX laser.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452208","annotations":[{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.775096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.766664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Laser ablation","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_ablation"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.732206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.714726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.626629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.487823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.455374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.363838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Fourier transform","weight":0.329011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.309423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Excimer","weight":0.261683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.192612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Phototherapeutic keratectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototherapeutic_keratectomy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Photorefractive effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_effect"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
