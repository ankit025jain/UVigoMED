{"id":68927,"title":"[CCAFU Recommendations 2013: Bladder carcinoma].","abstract":"The objective was to update the guidelines of the French Urological Association Cancer Committee for non invasive (NMIBC) and invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).A Medline search was performed between 2010 and 2013, as regards diagnosis, options of treatment and follow-up of bladder cancer, to evaluate different references with levels of evidence.Diagnosis of NMIBC (Ta, T1, CIS) depends on cystoscopy and complete deep resection of the tumour. The use of fluorescence and a second-look indication are essential to improve initial diagnosis. Risks of both recurrence and progression can be estimated using the EORTC score. A stratification of patients into low, intermediate and high groups is pivotal for recommending adjuvant treatment: instillation of chemotherapy (immediate post-operative, standard schedule) or intravesical BCG (standard schedule and maintenance). Cystectomy is recommended in BCG-refractory patients. Extension evaluation of MIBC is based on pelvic-abdominal and thoracic CT-scan, MRI and FDGPET remain optional. Cystectomy associated with extensive lymph nodes resection is considered the gold standard for non metastatic MIBC. An orthotopic bladder substitution should be proposed to both male and female patients lacking any contraindications and in cases of negative frozen urethral samples, otherwise trans-ileal ureterostomy is recommended as urinary diversion. The interest of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is well known for advanced MIBC as T3-T4 and/or N1-3. As regards metastatic MIBC, first-line chemotherapy using platin is recommended (GC or MVAC), when status (PS<1) and renal function (creatinine clearance > 60 ml/min) permits (only in 50% of cases). In second line treatment, only chemotherapy using vinfluvine has been validated to date. Conclusion.-These new guidelines will hopefully contribute not only to improve patient management, but also diagnosis and treatment for NMIBC and MIBC.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male
