{"id":90048,"title":"The effect of strut allograft and its position on Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic femoral fractures: a biomechanical study.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to assess the biomechanical advantage of adding strut allograft and the effect of its position on the construct in Vancouver type B1 fractures. Fifteen forth-generation synthetic femurs were used and created a fracture model at the tip of prosthesis, and subsequently fixated with a lateral plate only, lateral plate and medial strut, lateral plate and anterior strut. Rotational and axial tests were performed. In all loading tests, the plate with medial strut group was stiffer than the other constructs and had higher failure load values and had less displacement in the fracture site. A combination of a plate with a medial strut allograft provides more mechanical stability on periprosthetic femoral fractures near the tip of a total hip arthroplasty.
