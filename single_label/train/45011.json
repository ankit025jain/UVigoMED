{"id":45011,"title":"Recurrent peritoneal inclusion cysts successfully treated with oral contraceptives: a report of two cases.","abstract":"To examine whether conservative treatment with oral contraceptives is effective in the shrinkage of a peritoneal inclusion cyst (PIC). This is a case report of two patients with a PIC that developed after gynecological surgery.Both cases were suspected of a PIC based on the medical history, laboratory data, and image findings. It was difficult in differentiate a PIC from an ovarian tumor. Surgery was chosen at first. However, PICs in both cases recurred after surgery and were treated with oral contraceptives as a conservative treatment. PICs shrank after the treatment of oral contraceptives in both cases.Due to the high rate of recurrence following surgery, conservative treatment is recommended to treat PICs. Hormone therapy using oral contraceptives seems to have some therapeutic benefit for the PICs.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707692","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.805036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.640172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.590687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.390506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"History","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.17344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
