{"id":90980,"title":"Mount Everest and Makalu cold injury amputation: 40 years on.","abstract":"Freezing cold injuries (frostbite) of the extremities are a common injury among alpinists participating in high altitude expeditions, particularly during inclement weather conditions. Anecdotally, a digit that has suffered frostbite may be at greater risk to future cold injuries. In this case study, we profile a 62-year-old elite alpinist who suffered multiple digit amputations on both his hands and foot after historic summit attempts on Makalu (8481?m) and Mt. Everest (8848?m) in 1974-1979. We describe the clinical treatment he received at that time, and follow up his case 40 years after the first incidence of frostbite utilizing a noninvasive evaluation of hand and foot function to a cold stress test, including rates of re-warming to both injured and non-injured digits. Finger rates of recovery to the cold stress test were not different (0.8 vs. 1.0°C·min(-1)) except one (injured, left middle finger, distal phalanx; 0.4°C·min(-1)). Toe recovery rates after cold-water immersion were identical between previously injured and non-injured toes (0.2°C·min(-1)). Thermocouple data indicate that this alpinist's previous frostbite injuries may not have significantly altered his digit rates of re-warming during passive recovery compared to his non-injured digits.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559468","annotations":[{"name":"Frostbite","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.795104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Mountaineering","weight":0.429715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.306078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.299516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Mount Everest","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest"},{"name":"Weather","weight":0.202379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0433842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Thermocouple","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple"},{"name":"Distal phalanges","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_phalanges"},{"name":"Phalanx bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone"},{"name":"Makalu","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makalu"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Cardiac stress test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_stress_test"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Coldwater fish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldwater_fish"},{"name":"High altitude","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_altitude"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"},{"name":"Peak oil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil"},{"name":"Elite","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Middle finger","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_finger"}]}
