{"id":21347,"title":"Molecular characterization of carbapenem-insensitive Acinetobacter baumannii in Egypt.","abstract":"This study investigated the prevalence of diverse Ambler class ?-lactamase-encoding genes in 40 carbapenem-insensitive Acinetobacter baumannii isolates collected from two hospitals in Egypt during the period January-March 2012.The resistance levels to different groups of antimicrobial agents were determined. PCR was used to detect the different Ambler class ?-lactamases encoding the following genes: blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaVEB, blaPER, blaGES, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaSIM, blaSPM, blaGIM, blaNDM, blaADC, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-51, and blaOXA-58. ISAba1 and int1 were detected by PCR.The isolates were 100% resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate, aztreonam, cefepime, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. Of the isolates, 5% were resistant to colistin, 45% to amikacin, 70% to imipenem, and 85% to ciprofloxacin. The blaADC- and blaOXA-51-like genes were detected in the entire collection. The prevalences of blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, and blaOXA-58 were 50%, 7.5%, and 5%, respectively. However, the prevalences of blaTEM-, blaPER-, and blaGES-like genes were 87.5%, 55%, and 27.5%, respectively. SHV, CTX-M, VEB, KPC, and MBL encoding genes were not detected. The ISAba1 was found upstream to blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, and blaADC in 85%, 80%, and 50%, respectively. Of note, 45% (18/40) of the isolates co-produced extended-spectrum ?-lactamases (PER and GES) and carbapenemases (OXA-23 and OXA-58).The blaADC-, blaTEM-, blaPER-, blaOXA-23-, and blaGES-like genes were found to be the most prevalent types of ?-lactamase-encoding gene in A. baumannii collected from Egypt. A high level of carbapenem resistance is mediated by blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, and blaOXA-58 (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 32 to >256?g/ml), and a low level of carbapenem resistance is mediated by blaGES (MIC 4-16?g/ml) and by up-regulation of ISAba1-OXA-51 (MIC 1-4?g/ml). Class B MBL was not identified to play a role in carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii isolates from Egypt.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607428","annotations":[{"name":"Cefepime","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefepime"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.90334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Colistin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin"},{"name":"Aztreonam","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztreonam"},{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Amikacin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amikacin"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Cefotaxime","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Ceftazidime","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.762851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.713231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.675385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.503117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.460569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Middle Low German","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Low_German"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"1840","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1840"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Volkseigener Betrieb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkseigener_Betrieb"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Mannan-binding lectin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannan-binding_lectin"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"SHV Holdings","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHV_Holdings"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Ambler, Pennsylvania","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambler,_Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"}]}
