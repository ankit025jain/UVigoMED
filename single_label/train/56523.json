{"id":56523,"title":"Clinical results of selective laser trabeculoplasty in silicone oil-induced secondary glaucoma.","abstract":"To analyze the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) on silicone oil-induced secondary glaucoma in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP).42 patients (42 eyes) with silicone oil-induced secondary glaucoma were selected, and SLT was performed with 360° of the trabecular meshwork. During the 12-month follow-up, the complications, IOP, and antiglaucoma medication usage were observed.The mean IOP decreased from 23.1?±?1.9 mmHg before treatment to 18.4?±?3.7 mmHg after treatment (p?<?0.05). Mean number of antiglaucoma medications used for IOP control also decreased from 2.17?±?1.21 to 1.25?±?0.89 (p?<?0.05). The 12-month success rate in the total sample was 59.5 %. The success rate was 60.7 % (17 eyes) and 57.1 % (eight eyes) for phakic and aphakic eyes, respectively (p?>?0.05) CONCLUSIONS: SLT is a safe and effective option for the treatment of patients with silicone oil-induced secondary glaucoma.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671473","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Trabecular meshwork","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecular_meshwork"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.643929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.620354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.553608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.485571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.423636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.413143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.376491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Aphakia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphakia"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"IBM Solid Logic Technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Solid_Logic_Technology"}]}
