{"id":76224,"title":"Ferret nutrition.","abstract":"The domestic ferret (Mustela putorious furo) is a strict carnivore, also referred to as an obligate carnivore. Its dentition and gastrointestinal tract are adapted to a carnivorous diet. Its ancestor, the European polecat (Mustela putorius), feeds on birds and other small vertebrates. Domesticated ferrets have been fed mink feeds, cat foods, and now mostly subsist on commercial ferret diets formulated specifically to meet their needs.
