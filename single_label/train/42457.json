{"id":42457,"title":"The clinical characteristics of colonic pseudo-obstruction and the factors associated with medical treatment response: a study based on a multicenter database in Korea.","abstract":"Colonic pseudo-obstruction (CPO) is defined as marked colonic distension in the absence of mechanical obstruction. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of CPO and the factors associated with the response to medical treatment by using a multicenter database in Korea. CPO was diagnosed as colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction by using radiologic and/or endoscopic examinations. Acute CPO occurring in the postoperative period in surgical patients or as a response to an acute illness was excluded. CPO cases were identified in 15 tertiary referral hospitals between 2000 and 2011. The patients' data were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. In total, 104 patients (53 men; mean age at diagnosis, 47 yr) were identified. Seventy-seven of 104 patients (74%) showed a transition zone on abdominal computed tomography. Sixty of 104 patients (58%) showed poor responses to medical treatment and underwent surgery at the mean follow-up of 7.4 months (0.5-61 months). Younger age at the time of diagnosis, abdominal distension as a chief complaint, and greater cecal diameter were independently associated with the poor responses to medical treatment. These may be risk factors for a poor response to medical treatment.
