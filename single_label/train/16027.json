{"id":16027,"title":"Impact of seafood regulations for Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection and verification by analyses of seafood contamination and infection.","abstract":"Consumption of seafood contaminated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus causes foodborne infections, which are on the rise owing to increased consumption of raw seafood in Asia, Europe, North America, and other regions. V. parahaemolyticus infections have been common in Japan since the 1960s. Following an epidemic in 1997, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare instituted regulations for seafood in 1999, which appear to be reducing V. parahaemolyticus infections. In this review, we describe the scientific findings for these regulations. Analyses of the V. parahaemolyticus serotypes and isolate characteristics in samples from infected patients and contaminated seafood are discussed. In addition, based on the results of a survey, we show that new food safety regulations have led to improvements in food hygiene at many seafood retail shops, food service facilities, and restaurants. This example from Japan could be of immense help to control foodborne infections in other countries.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078437","annotations":[{"name":"Japan","weight":0.741659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)","weight":0.636498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare_(Japan)"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.621393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Food safety","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.602757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.568608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.551401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.525607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.473099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.455229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.383095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Seafood","weight":0.36982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood"},{"name":"Restaurant","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.141581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.122383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Welfare","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare"},{"name":"Labour Party (UK)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Foodservice","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodservice"},{"name":"Retail","weight":0.0438327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_parahaemolyticus"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"1960s","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"1960","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Japanese abbreviated and contracted words","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_abbreviated_and_contracted_words"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
