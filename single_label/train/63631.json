{"id":63631,"title":"Changes in the clinical impact of high-risk human leukocyte antigen allele mismatch combinations on the outcome of unrelated bone marrow transplantation.","abstract":"Several high-risk HLA allele mismatch combinations (HR-MMs) for severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) have been identified by analyzing transplantation outcomes in Japanese unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In this study, we analyzed the effects of HR-MMs in 3 transplantation time periods. We confirmed that the incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD in the HR-MM group was significantly higher than that in the low-risk (LR) MM group (hazard ratio [HR], 2.74; P < .0001) in the early time period (1993 to 2001). However, the difference in the incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD between the HR-MM and LR-MM groups was not statistically significant (HR, 1.06; P = .85 and HR, .40; P = .21, respectively) in the mid (2002 to 2007) and late (2008 to 2011) time periods. Similarly, survival in the HR-MM group was significantly inferior to that in the LR-MM group (HR, 1.46; P = .019) in the early time period, whereas the difference in survival between the 2 groups was not statistically significant in the mid and late time periods (HR, 1.06; P = .75 and HR, .82; P = .58, respectively). In conclusion, the adverse impact of HR-MM has become less significant over time. Unrelated transplantation with a single HR-MM could be a viable option in the absence of a matched unrelated donor or an unrelated donor with a single LR-MM.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417871","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.426713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.375769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"1993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
