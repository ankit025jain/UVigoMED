{"id":84901,"title":"Unpredictable chronic mild stress induced behavioral deficits: a comparative study in male and female rats.","abstract":"Stress is an important precipitant factor for depression. Changes in various body systems that occur in depression are similar to those observed in response to stress. Chronic stress may alter behavioral, neurochemical and physiological responses to drug challenges and novel stressors. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) also produces alteration in the serotonergic (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) neurotransmission. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) could be used as an animal model of depression. Neurochemical and behavioral effects of UCMS can be reversed by antidepressant agents, suggesting an important role of serotonin. In rodents, UCMS can elicit depression-like symptoms. The objective of the present study was to evaluate and compare the behavioral deficits induced by chronic mild stress in male and female rats and finding out the vulnerability of the two groups. Male and female rats exposed to UCMS exhibited a significant decrease in cumulative food intake as well as in growth rate. Loco motor activity in home cage and open field was also decreased. Results may contribute to our understanding of the interaction between stress and behavioral functions have to depressive disorders.
