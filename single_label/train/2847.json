{"id":2847,"title":"Tracing retinal blood vessels by matrix-forest theorem of directed graphs.","abstract":"This paper aims to trace retinal blood vessel trees in fundus images. This task is far from being trivial as the crossover of vessels are commonly encountered in image-based vessel networks. Meanwhile it is often crucial to separate the vessel tree structures in applications such as diabetic retinopathy analysis. In this work, a novel directed graph based approach is proposed to cast the task as label propagation over directed graphs, such that the graph is to be partitioned into disjoint sub-graphs, or equivalently, each of the vessel trees is traced and separated from the rest of the vessel network. Then the tracing problem is addressed by making novel usage of the matrix-forest theorem in algebraic graph theory. Empirical experiments on synthetic as well as publicly available fundus image datasets demonstrate the applicability of our approach.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333171","annotations":[{"name":"Graph theory","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"},{"name":"Algebraic graph theory","weight":0.455372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_graph_theory"},{"name":"Directed graph","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph"},{"name":"Graph (mathematics)","weight":0.424949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Theorem","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.148115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Tree structure","weight":0.141174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Subgraph","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Trace (linear algebra)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Record label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"},{"name":"Triviality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Abstract algebra","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Disjoint sets","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets"},{"name":"Partition of a set","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set"},{"name":"Tracing (software)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"}]}
