{"id":46986,"title":"Proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics: their emerging roles in the discovery and validation of colorectal cancer biomarkers.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in females and the third in males. Since CRC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when prognosis is poor, identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis is urgently required. Recent advances in proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics have facilitated high-throughput profiling of data generated from CRC-related genes and proteins, providing a window of information for biomarker discovery and validation. However, transfer of candidate biomarkers from bench to bedside remains a dilemma. In this review, we will discuss emerging proteomic technologies and highlight various sample types utilized for proteomics-based identification of CRC biomarkers. Moreover, recent breakthroughs in genomics and transcriptomics for the identification of CRC biomarkers, with particular emphasis on the merits of emerging methylomic and miRNAomic strategies, will be discussed. Integration of proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics will facilitate the discovery and validation of CRC biomarkers leading to the emergence of personalized medicine.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611605","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.779914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.775927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.771894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.535169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.504448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"},{"name":"Translational medicine","weight":0.137884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Biomarker discovery","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker_discovery"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Cyclic redundancy check","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Dilemma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"}]}
