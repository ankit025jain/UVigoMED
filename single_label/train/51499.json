{"id":51499,"title":"Anti-obesity effects of KR-66195, a synthetic DPP-IV inhibitor, in diet-induced obese mice and obese-diabetic ob/ob mice.","abstract":"We investigated whether KR-66195, a new synthetic dipeptidyl dipeptidase IV inhibitor, could prevent weight gain, as well as improving glycemic control in diet-induced obese (DIO) and ob/ob mice.Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the following groups: chow diet, high-fat diet, and high-fat diet with KR-66195. After KR-66195 treatment for eight weeks, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed. A pair-feeding study was performed to investigate the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of KR-66195 in DIO mice. Female ob/ob mice were treated with KR-66195 for three weeks and compared to the vehicle-treated group.In DIO mice, KR-66195 treatment increased the plasma glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 levels and improved glucose tolerance. This treatment also reduced body weight gain (5.38±0.94 g vs. 12.08±0.55 g, P<0.01) and food intake (2.41±0.09 g vs. 2.79±0.11 g, P<0.05). In ob/ob mice, KR-66195 treatment for three weeks resulted in comparable effects in DIO mice. In the pair-feeding study, KR-66195-treated mice exhibited a 16% increase in energy expenditure (kcal/h/kg lean body mass) without significant differences in body weight or activities compared with pair-fed mice. These results suggest that KR-66195 prevented weight gain in DIO mice by decreasing food intake, as well as increasing energy expenditure.KR-66195 markedly increased plasma levels of GLP-1, resulting in the probable improvement in glucose tolerance and reduced body weight and food intake. Thus, KR-66195 might be further developed as a therapeutic drug to treat obesity, as well as diabetes.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684824","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.748285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.732852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.621033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.620795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.554997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4","weight":0.52721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.213827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dipeptidase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidase"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Energy balance (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_balance_(biology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/410"},{"name":"790","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/790"},{"name":"380","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/380"},{"name":"Chow Chow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_Chow"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Defense Industries Organization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Industries_Organization"},{"name":"Toyota C transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_C_transmission"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
