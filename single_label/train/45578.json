{"id":45578,"title":"The diagnostic yield of upper endoscopy procedures in children- is it cost effective?","abstract":"Upper endoscopy is an invaluable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of various gastrointestinal symptoms in children. Over the years, the number of endoscopic procedures performed in different medical centers has increased considerably and the cost associated with the procedure has become unsustainable. Recently, the US government has investigated this topic and has suggested steps to reduce the cost and use of endoscopic procedures in the adult population, changes that have not been accepted favorably by the American Gastroenterology Associations (AGA). In the present report, we evaluate the diagnostic yield of the procedure in children and suggest steps to reduce the annual number of upper endoscopic procedures in children. The diagnostic yield and the cost-effectiveness of the procedure are also discussed.
