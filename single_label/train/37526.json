{"id":37526,"title":"Diagnostic overview of blood-based dysferlin protein assay for dysferlinopathies.","abstract":"Dysferlin deficiency causes dysferlinopathies. Among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the dysferlin protein is expressed specifically in CD14(+) monocytes.We quantified dysferlin protein levels in PBMC lysates of 77 individuals suspected clinically of having a dysferlinopathy to screen for true positives. Subsequent molecular confirmation was done by Sanger sequencing and comparative genomic hybridization arrays to establish diagnosis.Of the 44 individuals who had significantly reduced dysferlin levels (?10%), 41 underwent molecular testing. We identified at least 1 mutation in 85% (35 of 41), and 2 mutations, establishing a dysferlinopathy diagnosis, in 61% (25 of 41) of these individuals. Among those with dysferlin protein levels of >10% (33 of 77), only 1 individual (of 14 who underwent molecular testing) had a detectable mutation.Our results suggest that dysferlin protein levels of ?10% in PBMCs, are highly indicative of primary dysferlinopathies. However, this assay may not distinguish carriers from those with secondary dysferlin reduction.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488599","annotations":[{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.84351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Comparative genomic hybridization","weight":0.800917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.766802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.436877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.363121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Dysferlin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysferlin"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"CD14","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD14"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Frederick Sanger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
