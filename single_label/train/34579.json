{"id":34579,"title":"[Current status and future perspective in inherited cardiac arrhythmias].","abstract":"Some patients with inherited cardiac arrhythmias such as congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome, and early repolarization syndrome (ERS) have a link to mutations in genes encoding for ion channels or other membrane components. The diagnosis and management for inherited cardiac arrhythmias have been updated in recently published HRS/EHRA/APHRS Expert Consensus Statement. More recently, an exome study or whole genome study by using next generation sequencer as well as a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by using a gene array have been introduced to identify a new responsible gene or to explore the role of common genetic variants (polymorphisms) as a susceptible or modifier gene in inherited cardiac arrhythmias.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724419","annotations":[{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.933358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.81506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.542693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"Brugada syndrome","weight":0.390579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genome-wide association study","weight":0.132977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.0880793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Repolarization","weight":0.0608789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repolarization"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"}]}
