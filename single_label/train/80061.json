{"id":80061,"title":"[Species identification in 5 imported cases previously diagnosed as Vivax malaria by parasitological and nested PCR techniques].","abstract":"To identify the species of malaria parasites in 5 imported cases previously diagnosed as vivax malaria.Epidemiological information and blood samples were collected from five patients who returned from Africa and were diagnosed as vivax malaria. The detection was conducted by microscopy, right VIEW rapid malaria test (RDTs) and nested PCR with Plasmodium genus-specific and species-specific primers. The amplified products were sequenced and Blast analysis was performed.Three of the 5 cases had a history of malaria attack. Microscopically, 4 cases were confirmed as Plasmodium ovale infection, 1 (case 1) was co-infected with P. vivax and P. ovale. All 5 cases showed negative RDT results. Nested PCR detection revealed that the 5 cases had a P. ovale-specific fragment (800 bp), while case 1 had a P. vivax-specific fragment (120 bp) concurrently. Blast analysis showed that the amplified sequence of the 5 cases had a high sequence homology (99%) with P. ovale gene for small subunit ribosomal RNA from GenBank, and that of case 1 also shared 99% homology with P. vivax isolate SV5 18S ribosomal RNA gene (GenBank accession number: JQ627157.1).Among the five cases, four were infected by Plasmodium ovale, and one was co-infected with both P. vivax and P. ovale.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812863","annotations":[{"name":"Species","weight":0.839625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.757715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Plasmodium ovale","weight":0.754135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.692368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.600097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.560135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.50132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.203316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"18S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.144639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"}]}
