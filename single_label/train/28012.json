{"id":28012,"title":"Social adjustment of women with and without a substance-abusing partner.","abstract":"Little normative information is available about the psychosocial functioning of women who have a substance-abusing intimate partner. This study examined whether the social adjustment of women who indicate that they have a substance-abusing partner (n=69) is compromised relative to that of women who indicate that their partner does not abuse substances (n=68). Women with a substance-abusing partner reported compromised social adjustment relative to a comparison sample both overall and in five of six life domains (work, social/leisure, primary relationship, parental, family). Results suggest the potential benefit of expanding the focus of research and treatment to include effects and outcomes for these women and to influence treatment-related policy.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052786","annotations":[{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.701775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.605897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.423583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Intimate relationship","weight":0.197134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_relationship"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.188519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0667731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
