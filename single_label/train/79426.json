{"id":79426,"title":"[Electroglottography - an objective method for the evaluation of the vocal function in the children: reliability and validity].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to estimate the relevance and validity of the electroglottographic technique as a method for diagnostics of voice disorders in children. The authors analyse the normative data on the vocal disorders in the children obtained by electroglottography (EGT) and assess the value of this technique for the control of treatment of dysphonia of different etiology. It is shown that that dynamics of these findings (before and after the treatment including their comparison with age-related normative data) attains statistical significance . It is concluded that the results of EGT can be regarded as the important diagnostic criteria for the effectiveness and quality of the treatment of dysphonia of different origin in children.
