{"id":55234,"title":"Nutrition and age-related macular degeneration: research evidence in practice.","abstract":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in developed countries. In the absence of effective treatments to slow AMD progression, it is predicted that the prevalence of AMD will double over the next 20 years. One area of significant interest is the potential role that nutrition may play in preventing and/or delaying the progression of AMD. Specifically, is there any benefit in oral antioxidant and/or mineral supplementation? This review critically evaluates the currently available evidence relating to nutrition and AMD, with particular reference to the key findings of two large National Eye Institute-sponsored clinical studies, namely, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2. Topical controversies relating to nutrition and AMD are considered and analyzed in the context of the published literature to guide practitioners through assessing the merit, or otherwise, of common claims. This article provides a foundation for clinicians to provide informed advice to AMD patients based on available research evidence.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24950031","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.624152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Dietary mineral","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_mineral"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Foundation (non-profit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(non-profit)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Age-Related Eye Disease Study","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age-Related_Eye_Disease_Study"}]}
