{"id":15384,"title":"Development of vaccines to control the worldwide tuberculosis pandemic.","abstract":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and tuberculosis (TB) disease are major public health problems. Available BCG vaccines are partially effective against severe disease, but have not reduced the overall prevalence of TB infection and disease. A third of the world's population is latently infected with Mtb, and therefore more effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines are urgently needed. The Hoft laboratory and the Saint Louis University Center for Vaccine Development (SLUCVD) are actively pursuing these important goals.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211863","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.561562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Saint","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Saint Louis University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_University"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"St. Louis, Missouri","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
