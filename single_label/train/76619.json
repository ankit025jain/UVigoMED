{"id":76619,"title":"[Estimation of plasma vitamin A, C and E levels in patients with metabolic syndrome].","abstract":"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a coexistence of metabolic risk factors affecting development of cardiovascular diseases. In the pathogenesis of MS there participate reactive oxygen species which are excessively produced in such elements of MS as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and obesity. Vitamins A, C and E are an important part of the non-enzymatic antioxidative barrier in humans. The aim of the study was to estimate plasma vitamin A, C and E levels in patients with symptoms of MS.The study included 68 patients with symptoms of MS according to International Diabetes Federation criteria (2005), 37 men and 31 women, aged 34-65 years (mean age 57, 76 +/- 8, 29 years). The control group consisted of 24 healthy individuals without MS, 18 men and 6 women, aged 49-67 (mean age 58, 5 +/- 5, 6 years). Plasma vitamin A, C and E levels were estimated in patients and the control group with spectrophotometry using T60V spectrophotometer (PG Instruments).The plasma vitamin A, C and E levels were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in MS patients than in the healthy individuals without symptoms of MS. The most significant differences in the level of antioxidative vitamins in both groups were related to vitamin C and vitamin E.The decreased level of vitamins A, C and E points to the weakening of antioxidative barrier in patients with MS.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964509","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.869868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.767901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.689637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.65476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.188159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
