{"id":4494,"title":"[Clinical research of electroacupuncture at acupoints of qijie area combined with spine balance-regulating massage on posterior circulation ischemia].","abstract":"To compare the clinical efficacy difference between electroacupuncture (EA) at qijie area combined with spine balance-regulating massage and medication for posterior circulation ischemia (PCI).One hundred cases of PCI were randomly divided into a treatment group (50 cases) and a medication group (50 cases). The treatment group was treated with EA at Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Shenshu (BL 23), Danzhong (CV 17), etc. in qijie area combined with spine muscle-relieving massage and comprehensive chiropractic. The medication group was treated with oral administration of nimodipine (30 mg per time, three treatments per day) and vinpocetine injection with 500 mL of glucose injection or intravenous drip of 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride injection, once a day. Ten treatments were taken as one course in both groups, and two courses were given. The symptom score, mean resistance index (RI) of vertebral artery (VA) and basilar artery (BA), mean velocity of blood flow (Vm) and comprehensive clinical efficacy were compared before and after treatment in two groups.The cured and markedly effective rate was 79.6% (39/49) in the treatment group, which was superior to 54.7% (23/42) in the medication group (P<0.05). The symptom score was both significantly improved after treatment in two groups (both P<0.05), which was more obvious in the treatment group (P<0.05). The RI of VA and BA, Vm of VA and BA were significantly improved after treatment in two groups (all P<0.05), which were more obvious in the treatment group (all P<0.05).The electroacupuncture combined with spine balance-regulating massage has superior effect on improving mean velocity of blood flow and resistance index of vertebral artery and basilar artery as well as symptom score to medication, and is believed to be a safe and effective treatment for posterior circulation ischemia.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
