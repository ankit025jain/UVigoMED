{"id":79898,"title":"Acceptance of illness and satisfaction with life among malaria patients in rivers state, Nigeria.","abstract":"Health condition is one of the basic factors affecting satisfaction with life, and the level of illness acceptance. The purpose of the study was to analyse the level of illness acceptance, the level of satisfaction with life among malaria patients, and the level of trust placed in the physician and the nurse.The study employs the method of diagnostic survey based on standardised AIS and SWLS scales, as well as Anderson and Dedrick's PPTS and PNTS scales.The average AIS level was 12 points, while the average level of SwL at the SWLS scale was 16.5 points. The average level of trust in the physician and the nurse amounted to 50.6 points and 51.4 points, respectively. The correlation between the level of illness acceptance and self-evaluated satisfaction with life was statistically significant, with R?=?0.56. The marital status influenced the level of illness acceptance with p?<?0.05 and the level of satisfaction with life with p?<?0.05. The employment status affected the level of satisfaction with life with p?<?0.05 and the level of illness acceptance with p?<?0.05.The majority of malaria patients did not accept their illness, while the level of satisfaction with life was low. The majority of respondents trusted their physician and nurse. There is a statistically significant correlation between the level of illness acceptance and the self-evaluated satisfaction with life. The marital status had a statistically significant effect on the acceptance of illness and the satisfaction with life. The individuals who had a job demonstrated higher levels of quality of life and illness acceptance.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885562","annotations":[{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.727236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.579973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.555119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.503879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.472763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.39817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Marital status","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_status"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.163905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"River","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Prospective Piloted Transport System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_Piloted_Transport_System"},{"name":"Gary Anderson (placekicker)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Anderson_(placekicker)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Acceptance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance"},{"name":"Trust metric","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_metric"},{"name":"Satisfaction with Life Index","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfaction_with_Life_Index"},{"name":"Trust law","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law"}]}
