{"id":77025,"title":"Enhanced gastric tolerability and improved anti-obesity effect of capsaicinoids-loaded PCL microparticles.","abstract":"Capsaicinoids show several pharmacological effects including weight loss. However, their pungency limits the long-term use through the gastrointestinal tract. In that sense, the goal of this study was to prepare capsaicinoids-loaded poly(?-caprolactone) microparticles as an oral carrier in order to improve their gastric tolerability and to make feasible the long-term treatment of obesity. Formulations containing 3, 5 and 10% capsaicinoids were successfully obtained by simple emulsion/solvent evaporation method. Values of encapsulation efficiency above 90% were achieved. Microparticles showed spherical shape and smooth surface. The particle size was suitable for oral use in order to provide an extended release through the gastrointestinal tract. No chemical bond was observed between drug and polymer. Microencapsulation led to drug amorphization. Formulations prolonged the release of capsaicinoids without changing the release kinetic (biexponential model). Microencapsulation increased the gastric tolerability of capsaicinoids because it prevented inflammatory processes in the stomach of rats. Microparticles containing 5% capsaicinoids demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of Lee index, mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat pads of rats with obesity induced by hypothalamic lesion using monosodium l-glutamate. In summary, capsaicinoids-loaded poly(?-caprolactone) microparticles are low-irritative oral controlled-release carriers for a long-term use in obesity.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857502","annotations":[{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.884752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Capsaicin","weight":0.719889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin"},{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Evaporation","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.583441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Amorphous solid","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_solid"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.562303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.460485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.18915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Monosodium glutamate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0236807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Paw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paw"},{"name":"Particle size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_size"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Subatomic particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle"},{"name":"Micro-encapsulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-encapsulation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Piquance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piquance"}]}
