{"id":68181,"title":"Relationships between CYP1A1 genetic polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"This meta-analysis aims at evaluating the relationships between CYP1A1 genetic polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk. The PubMed, CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases were searched from inception through November 1st, 2013 without language restrictions. Meta-analysis was conducted with the use of the STATA 12.0 software. The relationships were evaluated by calculating the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Eight case-control studies with a total of 2120 bladder cancer patients and 2061 healthy subjects met the inclusion criteria. Ten common polymorphisms in the CYP1A1 gene were assessed. The results of our meta-analysis suggested that CYP1A1 genetic polymorphisms might be strongly correlated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (allele model: OR=1.23, 95%CI=1.08-1.39, p=0.001; dominant model: OR=1.25, 95%CI=1.07-1.46, p=0.005; respectively), especially for 11599G>C, 2455A>G, 3810T>C, and 113T>C polymorphisms. A subgroup analysis was done to investigate the effect of ethnicity on an individual's risk of bladder cancer. Our results revealed positive significant correlations between CYP1A1 genetic polymorphisms and an increased risk of bladder cancer among Asians (allele model: OR=1.33, 95%CI=1.08-1.65, p=0.009; dominant model: OR=1.37, 95%CI=1.02-1.85, p=0.034; respectively), but not among Caucasians (all p<0.05). Our findings provide convincing evidence that CYP1A1 genetic polymorphisms may contribute to susceptibility to bladder cancer, especially for 11599G>C, 2455A>G, 3810T>C, and 113T>C polymorphisms among Asians.
