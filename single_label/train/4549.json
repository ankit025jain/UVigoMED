{"id":4549,"title":"Rating of perceived exertion and acute mountain sickness during a high-altitude trek.","abstract":"There is a widely held belief that strenuous exercise should be avoided on arrival at high altitude (HA) and during acclimatization. Data from chamber studies are contradictory and the studies are usually of short duration, therefore differing from the \"real world.\"We studied 48 trekkers during a 10-d ascent to 16,827 ft (5129 m) in the Cordillera Real area of Bolivia. Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scores were recorded for the hardest perceived exertion during the day after ascents to 12,576, 14,600, and 16,827 ft (3833, 4450, and 5129 m). Heart rate, Spo2, and Lake Louise Score (LLS) were recorded simultaneously. Statistical testing was performed using SPSS 21 software. A P-value of ? 0.05 was deemed significant.Acute mountain sickness (AMS) rates were higher after trekking days with higher levels of perceived exertion. The LLS was higher in those with a Borg RPE score ? 15 both following exercise (mean LLS 2.6 vs. 1.7) and at rest the following day (mean LLS 2.7 vs. 1.7). Heart rate was higher in those with high Borg RPE scores (80 vs. 87) and oxygen saturations lower at rest (86 vs. 83) the following morning.This data lends weight to the advice of moderate exertion during a trek to HA and suggests that reducing perceived exertion may reduce AMS.","date":"2014-12-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25479264","annotations":[{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.592425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Bolivia","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia"},{"name":"Altitude sickness","weight":0.299715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.230631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.218346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Cordillera Real (Bolivia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordillera_Real_(Bolivia)"},{"name":"Borg scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_scale"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"High altitude","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_altitude"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hiking","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking"},{"name":"827","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/827"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"576","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cordillera","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordillera"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"American Meteorological Society","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Meteorological_Society"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Contradiction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Exercise bulimia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_bulimia"},{"name":"Exertion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exertion"},{"name":"Borg (Star Trek)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Acclimatization","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization"}]}
