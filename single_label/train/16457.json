{"id":16457,"title":"Prevalence surveys as part of a strategic plan to prevent healthcare associated infections. The experience of the University Hospital \"Federico II\" of Naples, Italy.","abstract":"The care-associated infections (HAI) are the most serious complication associated with medical care. They are the cause of diseases for patients and economic damage to public health. The University \"Federico II\" of Naples decided to monitor the HAI, repeating the prevalence survey conducted earlier in 2011 in order to analyze the phenomenon of infection and to evaluate the possible correlation with risk factors.The Survey was conducted according to ECDC criteria. Considered that the study carried out in 2011 was conducted following the same methodology, to compare the results of the year 2012 the prevalence rates of both years were standardized.For the year 2012, the number of patients enrolled in the study and stratification of patients by age and sex were similar to data collected in 2011. It was very interesting to find the prevalence of HAI standardized reduced in 2012 compared to 2011. As a matter of fact, in fact, that the standardized prevalence of HAI for the year 2012 was 3.1%, one percentage point lower than in 2011 (4.4%).The practical training and direct regarded as the most appropriate approach in order to make health professionals aware in the field of health care-associated infections, as well as the system of selfcontrol peripheral for the correct application of the procedures, as well as epidemiological surveillance active, measured through rates of incidence, at the same time allow the monitoring of the phenomenon is infectious and the application of corrective measures that prevent its onset. The choice to make again an epidemiological study of prevalence with the same methodology ensures, in fact, two advantages: the comparability of the data, both at intra-company both at regional, national and international evaluation of the effectiveness of corrective actions.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998219","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.645301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.583757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.560663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.439672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.255332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Naples","weight":0.208226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control"},{"name":"Strategic planning","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"De facto","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
