{"id":18953,"title":"Outcome assessment in conservatively managed patients with cervical spine tuberculosis.","abstract":"Cervical spine tuberculosis is a relatively less frequent form of spinal tuberculosis. Cervical spine tuberculosis has a greater propensity to involve the spinal cord and results in major sensory motor deficit. In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical and imaging predictors of outcome in conservatively managed patients.In this study, 42 patients of cervical spine tuberculosis were included. Patients were subjected to a detailed clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were treated with antituberculosis treatment and were followed up for 18 months. The Modified Barthel index (MBI) was used to assess the disability. Good outcome was defined as MBI >12 and poor outcome as MBI ?12. Clinical and imaging characteristics were used to analyze the predictors of outcome, using univariate and multivariate analysis.Four (9.5%) patients required surgery. Data from 38 patients, who were conservatively managed, were analyzed for predictors of outcome. Among conservatively managed patients, at presentation, 29 patients had an MBI score of ?12. At 18 months, the majority of patients (81.6%) had a good outcome. On univariate analysis, a duration of illness >3 months, a major motor deficit, bladder involvement, flexor spasms, significant cord compression and spinal extension of the abscess were significantly associated with a poor outcome. However, on multivariate analysis significant cord compression (P=0.003) and spinal extension (P=0.02) showed a significant correlation with a poor outcome.Medical management was effective in cervical spine tuberculosis. Patients with significant cord compression and spinal extension of the abscess showed poorer outcome.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752293","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.738882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.731015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.714271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.616623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.603496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.488493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.448874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.436741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Spinal cord compression","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_compression"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Pott disease","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pott_disease"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
