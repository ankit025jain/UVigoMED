{"id":32272,"title":"Botulinum toxin type-A in the management of spastic equinovarus deformity after stroke. Comparison of 2 injection techniques.","abstract":"To retrospectively compare 2 injection techniques in the management of spastic equinovarus deformity after stroke.Patients with stroke were seen at King Hussein Medical Center, Amman, Jordan between January and December 2009. The study design involved an open label retrospective analysis of medical records of 2 groups of comparable age and onset of first stroke. Botulinum toxin was injected into the calf muscles at 2 sites in group I (12 patients) and 4 sites in group II (14 patients). Functional gain was evaluated by the time to walk 10 meters at month one, 3, and 6 compared with baseline.There was significant improvement in walking time in each study group. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups as measured by the 10-meter walking time.Fewer injection sites would minimize patient discomfort and possibly the production of antibodies, yielding similar therapeutic effects.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983281","annotations":[{"name":"Botulinum toxin","weight":0.704079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.58999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.587584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Jordan","weight":0.485571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.352127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.241013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.107232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Botulism","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism"},{"name":"Hussein of Jordan","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_of_Jordan"},{"name":"Amman","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Record label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Open-label trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-label_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"10-meter band","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-meter_band"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"I12","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I12"},{"name":"Monarch","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch"},{"name":"Triceps surae muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_surae_muscle"},{"name":"Spastic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic"}]}
