{"id":87437,"title":"[Observation of clinical effects of surgery for trailing edge fracture of tibial plateau medial condyle and posterior cruciate ligament avulsion fracture].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical effects of enblock distal radius T-plate fixation in treating trailing edge fracture of tibial plateau medial condyle and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fracture.From September 2008 to November 2011, 5 patients with trailing edge fracture of tibial plateau medial condyle and PCL avulsion fracture caused by knee joint hyperextension,were treated with surgery. There were 3 males and 2 females with an average age of 35 years old (25 to 42). Left knee injury was in 3 cases and right knee had in 2 cases; 2 cases caused by sports injury and 3 cases caused by road accident. All patients were undergone emergency treatment. Fractures were anatomically reduced and fixed with T-plate through poples approach. Complications were observed after operation. Bone healing and clinical effects were respectively evaluated by X-rays and HSS system.Five patients were followed up for 1 to 4 years with a mean of 2 years. All incisions obtained healing of I stage. All knee joints recovered well and were stable with inflexion more than 120 degrees, no complications such as knee joint pain, injuries of nerve and blood vessel, infection, internal fixation failure were found. The mean score of HSS system was 94.40 +/- 6.09 and all patients got excellent result.For the treatment of trailing edge fracture of tibial plateau medial condyle and PCL avulsion fracture caused by knee joint hyperextension, enblock distal radius T-plate fixation had advantages of good stability,higher success rate, and knee joint function can recover well.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167676","annotations":[{"name":"Bone
