{"id":71926,"title":"Betulinic acid-induced cytotoxicity in human breast tumor cell lines MCF-7 and T47D and its modification by tocopherol.","abstract":"Betulinic acid (BA) has been shown to cause apoptosis in neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines. We evaluated the cytotoxicity of BA in two breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D differing in their p53 status. Treatment with BA resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. This indicates p53-independent apoptotic pathway, because response of both p53 mutant and wild type cell line were found unaffected after treatment with pifithrin-?, an inhibitor of p53. Cells were significantly protected when treated by tocopherol suggesting involvement of membrane centered lipid peroxidation-mediated mechanism in BA-induced apoptosis.
