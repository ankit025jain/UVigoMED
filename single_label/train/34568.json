{"id":34568,"title":"Living donor liver transplantation using a right liver graft with additional vein reconstructions for patient with situs inversus.","abstract":"Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) using a right liver graft with additional vein reconstructions has not been previously reported in a situs inversus (SI) patient. A 60-year-old man with SI was referred for LDLT for end-stage cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis B. The calculated regional volumes of the individual hepatic vein territories in the right liver graft suggested that the middle hepatic vein (MHV) tributaries and the inferior right hepatic veins (IRHVs) should be reconstructed in addition to the right hepatic vein (RHV). On the back-table, the recipient's recanalized umbilical vein graft was anastomosed to the V5 opening, and the other side of vein graft was anastomosed to the RHV and V8 opening to create a large single orifice. After total hepatectomy, the right liver graft was placed in the left subphrenic space at the reversed position. The common orifice of hepatic venous drainage from RHV, V8 and V5 was anastomosed to the anatomical RHV conduit of the recipient, followed by IRHV anastomosis to the inferior vena cava. Postoperative course was almost uneventful, and no vascular complications were experienced. Even for SI patients, LDLT using a right liver graft with reconstructions of the MHV tributaries and the IRHVs is feasible.
