{"id":77208,"title":"The 3 epimer of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is present in the circulation of the majority of adults in a nationally representative sample and has endogenous origins.","abstract":"Fundamental knowledge gaps in relation to the 3 epimer of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [3-epi-25(OH)D?] limit our understanding of its relevance for vitamin D nutrition and health. The aims of this study were to characterize the 3-epi-25(OH)D? concentrations in a nationally representative sample of adults and explore its determinants. We also used data from a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of supplemental cholecalciferol (vitamin D?) conducted in winter in older adults to directly test the impact of changes in vitamin D status on serum 3-epi-25(OH)D3 concentrations. Serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D?] and 3-epi-25(OH)D? concentrations (via LC-tandem mass spectrometry) from our vitamin D? RCT in adults (aged ?50 y) and data on dietary, lifestyle, and biochemical characteristics of participants of the recent National Adult Nutrition Survey in Ireland (aged 18-84 y; n = 1122) were used in the present work. In the subsample of participants who had serum 3-epi-25(OH)D? concentrations greater than the limit of quantification (n = 1082; 96.4%), the mean, 10th, 50th (median), and 90th percentile concentrations were 2.50, 1.05, 2.18, and 4.30 nmol/L, respectively, whereas the maximum 3-epi-25(OH)D? concentration was 15.0 nmol/L. A regression model [explaining 29.9% of the variability in serum 3-epi-25(OH)D?] showed that age >50 y, vitamin D supplement use, dietary vitamin D, meat intake, season of blood sampling, and sun exposure habits were significant positive determinants, whereas increasing waist circumference and serum 25-hydroxyergocalciferol concentration were significant negative determinants. The RCT data showed that mean serum 25(OH)D? and 3-epi-25(OH)D? concentrations increased (49.3% and 42.1%, respectively) and decreased (-28.0% and -29.1%, respectively) significantly (P < 0.0001) with vitamin D? (20 ?g/d) and placebo supplementation, respectively, over 15 wk of winter. In conclusion, we provide data on serum 3-epi-25(OH)D? in a nationally representative sample of adults. Our combined observational and RCT data might suggest that both dietary supply and dermal synthesis of vitamin D? contribute to serum 3-epi-25(OH)D? concentration.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828024","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin
