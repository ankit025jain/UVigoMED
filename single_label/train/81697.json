{"id":81697,"title":"Mass spectrometry analysis of gingival crevicular fluid in the presence of external root resorption.","abstract":"In this study, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to investigate the differences in the composition of gingival crevicular fluid between resorbing deciduous molars and nonresorbing permanent teeth. The main goal was to identify novel biomarkers associated with root resorption.Eleven children (4 boys, 7 girls) in the mixed dentition were selected to participate in this split-mouth design study, in which a deciduous secondÂ molar with radiographic evidence of root resorption served as the experimental site, and the permanent first molar on the contralateral quadrant was the control site. Gingival crevicular fluid was collected using absorbing strips. A total of 22 samples (11 root resorption, 11 control) were each analyzed with 1-dimensional LC-MS. The remaining samples were then pooled across the 11 patients and analyzed by 2-dimensional LC-MS. The output files were converted to mascot generic format, which can be used to perform protein identification with conventional search engines.The 2-dimensional LC-MS protocol was able to identify 2789 and 2421 proteins in the control and resorption pooled samples, respectively. In this population, we detected significantly upregulated and downregulated proteins in the teeth with root resorption. Interestingly, many of these proteins are characteristically found in exosomes.We identified novel proteins that might prove to be useful biomarkers of root resorption, individually or as part of a panel.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880850","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.692038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.542431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.388389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.270908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Deciduous","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.0779046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"Root resorption","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_resorption"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Exosome (vesicle)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosome_(vesicle)"},{"name":"Gingival sulcus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_sulcus"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Computer file","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Radio format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_format"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Web search engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mascot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Circular sector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector"},{"name":"Output","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"}]}
