{"id":50498,"title":"[Low level of 25-OH-vitamin D as a marker of critical ischemia in case of diabetic foot syndrome].","abstract":"It was done the prospective study of the examination results of 40 patients with diabetes mellitus. All patients were divided into 2 groups for study of 25-OH-vitamin D effect, cholesterol, triglycerides in blood serum on the nature of diabetes mellitus. The first group included patients with ulcero-necrotic injuries in case of neuro-ischemic forms of diabetic foot syndrome. The second group included patients without such injuries. It was significantly determined that there was more neuro-ischemic injuries in case of 25-OH-vitamin D level less than 30 nmol/l. Injuries are connected with reduction of arterial inflow because of osslusive-stenotic lesions of arteries. 25-OH-vitamin D level less than 30 nmol/l is a marker of neuro-ischemic injuries of foot in case of diabetes mellitus. This indication is more specific than cholesterol and triglycerides levels.
