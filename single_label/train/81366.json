{"id":81366,"title":"Clinical and microbiological evaluation of biofilm-gingival interface classification in patients with generalized forms of periodontitis.","abstract":"In 2008 a new division of periodontal diseases based on the concept of biofilm-gingival interface (BGI), was presented. The aim of this study was to assess whether the proposed BGI categories could be useful in diagnosing patients with generalized forms of both aggressive (gAP) and chronic (gCP) periodontitis. DESIGN AND KEY METHODS: The study group consisted of 40 individuals (17 with gAP and 23 with gCP). All patients were divided into three groups according to the BGI scale: 4 patients with P1 (pockets deeper than 4 mms with bleeding index below 10%), 20 individuals with P2 (pockets deeper than 4 mms with bleeding index 10-50%) and 16 individuals with P3 (pockets deeper than 4 mms with bleeding index above 50%). The presence of bacteria in subgingival plaque was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction method.Statistically significant differences with respect to all parameters measured were found when patients were grouped according to the BGI scale--they were higher in P3 group. In gAP group A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus were found in a higher numbers. No such differences were observed between P2 and P3 groups.The BGI scale seems to be helpful in effective and quick classifying of patients into adequate clinical subgroups.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115111","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.329172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.245507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.199057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans","weight":0.177158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregatibacter_actinomycetemcomitans"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1050","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1050"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Beijing Genomics Institute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Genomics_Institute"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Microsoft Media Server","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Media_Server"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
