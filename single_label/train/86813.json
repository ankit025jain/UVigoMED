{"id":86813,"title":"Subcutaneous (deep) fungal infections.","abstract":"Fungal infection is a common clinical problem in dermatology. While most cases in practice are superficial infections, invasive subcutaneous mycoses are important to recognize and treat, as these conditions often have significant morbidity and mortality. Deep fungi demonstrate species-specific syndromes and may be identified by clinical and histological features in addition to serological evaluation and culture. Identification of the common innoculation subcutaneous mycoses, as well as those associated with pulmonary primary infection and dissemination to the skin is important, as treatments vary by organism and clinical setting. This overview will help to identify the key dermatological presentations of subcutaneous fungal infection, and the clues they give to cause.","date":"2015-01-12","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577856","annotations":[{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.865624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.616083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.479277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
