{"id":83013,"title":"[Update on current care guideline: temporomandibular disorders (TMD)].","abstract":"Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common. Usual symptoms are joint noises and pain, pain in masticatory muscles, difficulties in jaw movements and headache. Treatment of TMD includes information on the background and good response to treatment of these disorders. The patient is advised on self-care routines, including relaxing the lower jaw, massaging the masticatory muscles and hot or cold packs on painful sites. Pharmacotherapy consists of paracetamol or anti-inflammatory analgesics. Occlusal appliances, physiotherapy, cognitive therapies and acupuncture are recommended. Complicated cases not responding to treatment are referred to specialized care.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471211","annotations":[{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.613516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.503856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.501239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.184824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.110496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint disorder","weight":0.0940919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"},{"name":"Ice pack","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_pack"},{"name":"Refrigerator","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
