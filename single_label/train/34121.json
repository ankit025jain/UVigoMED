{"id":34121,"title":"Developmental venous anomaly: MR and angiographic features.","abstract":"Developmental venous anomaly (DVA) is probably the most common anomaly of the intracranial vasculature. DVAs consist of multiple, radially oriented dilated medullary veins that converge into a transcerebral vein. We describe the imaging findings of this vascular anomaly in different patients and the role of different imaging modalities.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24765765","annotations":[{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.771715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.560502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.517797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medulla oblongata","weight":0.471948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulla_oblongata"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"}]}
