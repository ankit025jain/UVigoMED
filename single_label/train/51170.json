{"id":51170,"title":"Vitamin D and female fertility.","abstract":"Apart from the well known effects of vitamin D on maintaining calcium homeostasis and promoting bone mineralization, there is some evidence suggesting that vitamin D also modulates human reproductive processes. We will review the most interesting and relevant studies on vitamin D and female fertility published over the past year.In the past year, several observational studies reported a better in-vitro fertilization outcome in women with sufficient vitamin D levels (?30?ng/ml), which was mainly attributed to vitamin D effects on the endometrium. One randomized controlled trial found an increased endometrial thickness in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) receiving vitamin D during intrauterine insemination cycles. Further, vitamin D supplementation had a beneficial effect on serum lipids in PCOS women. Vitamin D treatment improved endometriosis in a rat model and increased vitamin D intake was related to a decreased risk of incident endometriosis. Vitamin D was also favorably associated with primary dysmenorrhea, uterine leiomyoma, and ovarian reserve in late reproductive aged women.In women undergoing in-vitro fertilization, a sufficient vitamin D level (?30?ng/ml) should be obtained. Vitamin D supplementation might improve metabolic parameters in women with PCOS. A high vitamin D intake might be protective against endometriosis.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717915","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Dysmenorrhea","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmenorrhea"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.855549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.847232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.84024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Artificial insemination","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.733162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Insemination","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insemination"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Ovarian reserve","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_reserve"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.262303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.196893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.196588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Mineralization (biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralization_(biology)"}]}
