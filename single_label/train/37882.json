{"id":37882,"title":"Complex hepatic outflow reconstruction in domino liver transplantation.","abstract":"Domino liver transplantation has been accepted as a safe procedure to further expand the organ donor pool. The most important technical challenge of the procedure resides in restoring a proper hepatic venous allograft outflow in the familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy-liver recipient. To overcome this issue, combined techniques were used to perform an innovative outflow reconstruction. A domino liver transplantation was successfully performed with reconstruction of complex venous outflow. The inferior vena cava sparing hepatectomy technique in the familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy-donor was used to cut the hepatic vein to the liver parenchyma. To overcome this issue the venous outflow tract was reconstructed using a longitudinally opened iliac vein graft from a post-mortem donor to create a new outflow tract using a diamond patch between the right and middle/left hepatic veins.
