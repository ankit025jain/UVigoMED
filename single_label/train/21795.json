{"id":21795,"title":"Separately or combined, LukG/LukH is functionally unique compared to other staphylococcal bicomponent leukotoxins.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that elaborates several exotoxins. Among these are the bicomponent leukotoxins (BCLs), which include ?-hemolysin, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), and LukDE. The toxin components are classified as either F or S proteins, which are secreted individually and assemble on cell surfaces to form hetero-oligomeric pores resulting in lysis of PMNs and/or erythrocytes. F and S proteins of ?-hemolysin, PVL and LukDE have ? 70% sequence homology within the same class and several heterologous combinations of F and S members from these three bicomponent toxin groups are functional. Recently, an additional BCL pair, LukGH (also called LukAB) that has only 30% homology to ?-hemolysin, PVL and LukDE, has been characterized from S. aureus. Our results showed that LukGH was more cytotoxic to human PMNs than PVL. However, LukGH-induced calcium ion influx in PMNs was markedly attenuated and slower than that induced by PVL and other staphylococcal BCLs. In contrast to other heterologous BCL combinations, LukG in combination with heterologous S components, and LukH in combination with heterologous F components did not induce calcium ion entry or cell lysis in human PMNs or rabbit erythrocytes. Like PVL, LukGH induced IL-8 production by PMNs. While individual components LukG and LukH had no cytolytic or calcium influx activity, they each induced high levels of IL-8 transcription and secretion. IL-8 production induced by LukG or LukH was dependent on NF-?B. Therefore, our results indicate LukGH differs functionally from other staphylococcal BCLs.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586678","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.785924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Cytolysis","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytolysis"},{"name":"Exotoxin","weight":0.726497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotoxin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hemolysin","weight":0.70518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysin"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.560158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Sweat gland","weight":0.43674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.366054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.322533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.205888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Panton-Valentine leukocidin","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panton-Valentine_leukocidin"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Heterologous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"}]}
