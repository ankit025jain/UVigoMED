{"id":92652,"title":"Can proton therapy improve the therapeutic ratio in breast cancer patients at risk for nodal disease?","abstract":"Regional node irradiation in patients with invasive breast cancer often results in increased radiation exposure to organs at risk. We evaluated the potential advantages of 3-dimensional conformal photon+proton therapy (3DCX+PT) in treating regional nodes versus photon-electron (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).Ten left-sided breast cancer patients underwent radiation treatment planning. 3DCX+PT, 3DCRT, and IMRT plans were generated for each patient.There was no significant difference in target coverage between 3DCX+PT and IMRT. However, coverage of level II axillary lymph nodes was inferior with 3DCRT with a median D95 of 45 versus 50 Gy with either IMRT (P=0.0006) or 49.5 CGE with 3DCX+PT (P=0.0033). Internal mammary nodes coverage was also inferior with 3DCRT (median D95 was 42 Gy) compared with 47 Gy with IMRT (P=0.043) or 48.5 CGE with 3DCX+PT (P=0.0068).With 3DCX+PT, left lung V20 and V5 were 31% and 50% versus 36% (P=0.0368) and 70% (P=0.0007) with 3DCRT and 30% (P=0.7328) and 81% (P=0.0002) for IMRT. 3DCX+PT resulted in heart V20 and heart V5 of 0% and 7%, respectively, versus 4% (P=0.0067) and 24% (P=0.0002) with 3DCRT and 21% (P=0.0001), 50% (P=0.0001) with IMRT. The IMRT plans produced significantly higher integral, contralateral lung, and breast doses.Regional node target coverage was inferior with 3DCRT compared with either IMRT or 3DCX+PT. Organs at risk were exposed to less radiation with 3DCX+PT compared with 3DCRT or IMRT. Proton treatment offered both improved coverage of the regional lymph nodes and decreased dose to the heart, lung, and contralateral normal tissue.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23466577","annotations":[{"name":"Proton therapy","weight":0.825739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.747562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.690852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.666785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.575603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.543093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.507053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.389303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.227283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.190116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.162771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.148497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0911197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Level II trauma center","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_II_trauma_center"}]}
