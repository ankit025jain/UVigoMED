{"id":73320,"title":"Targeted delivery of ?-galactosylceramide to CD8?+ dendritic cells optimizes type I NKT cell-based antitumor responses.","abstract":"Immunotherapy aiming at enhancing innate and acquired host immunity is a promising approach for cancer treatment. The invariant NKT (iNKT) cell ligand ?-galactosylceramide (?-GalCer) holds great promise in cancer therapy, although several concerns limit its use in clinics, including the uncontrolled response it promotes when delivered in a nonvectorized form. Therefore, development of delivery systems to in vivo target immune cells might be a valuable option to optimize iNKT cell-based antitumor responses. Using dendritic cell (DC)-depleted mice, DC transfer experiments, and in vivo active cell targeting, we show that presentation of ?-GalCer by DCs not only triggers optimal primary iNKT cell stimulation, but also maintains secondary iNKT cell activation after challenge. Furthermore, targeted delivery of ?-GalCer to CD8?(+) DCs, by means of anti-DEC205 decorated nanoparticles, enhances iNKT cell-based transactivation of NK cells, DCs, and ?? T cells. We report that codelivery of ?-GalCer and protein Ag to CD8?(+) DCs triggers optimal Ag-specific Ab and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell responses. Finally, we show that targeting nanoparticles containing ?-GalCer and Ag to CD8?(+) DCs promotes potent antitumor responses, both in prophylactic and in therapeutic settings. Our data may have important implications in tumor immunotherapy and vaccine development.
