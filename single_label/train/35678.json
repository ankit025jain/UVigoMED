{"id":35678,"title":"Prevalence and prognostic implication of restenosis or dilatation at the aortic coarctation repair site assessed by cardiovascular MRI in adult patients late after coarctation repair.","abstract":"Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is ideal for assessing patients with repaired aortic coarctation (CoA). Little is known on the relation between long-term complications of CoA repair as assessed by CMR and clinical outcome. We examined the prevalence of restenosis and dilatation at the repair site and the long-term outcome in patients with repaired CoA.CMR imaging and clinical data for adult CoA patients (247 patients aged 33.0 ± 12.8 years, 60% male), were analyzed. The diameter of the aorta at the repair site was measured on CMR and its ratio to the aortic diameter at the diaphragm (repair site-diaphragm ratio, RDR) was calculated. Restenosis (RDR?70%) was present in 31% of patients (and significant in 9% [RDR<50%]), and dilatation (RDR>150%) in 13.0%. A discrete aneurysm at the repair site was observed in 9%. Restenosis was more likely after resection and end-end anastomosis, whereas dilatation after patch repair. Systemic hypertension was present in 69% of patients. Of the hypertensive patients, blood pressure (133 ± 20/73 ± 10 mm Hg) was well controlled in 93% with antihypertensive therapy. Mortality rate over a median length of 5.9 years was low (0.69% per year, 95% CI: 0.33-1.26), but significantly higher than age-matched healthy controls (standardised mortality ratio 2.86, CI 1.43-5.72, p<0.001).Restenosis or dilatation at the CoA repair site as assessed by CMR is not uncommon. Medium term survival remains good, however, albeit lower than in the general population. Life-long follow-up and optimal blood pressure control are likely to secure a good longer term outlook in these patients.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631116","annotations":[{"name":"Coarctation of the aorta","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarctation_of_the_aorta"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.777981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.771483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.737922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.255334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Restenosis","weight":0.193284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restenosis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Standardized mortality ratio","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_mortality_ratio"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Transdermal patch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal_patch"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Coenzyme A","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_A"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
