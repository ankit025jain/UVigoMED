{"id":14282,"title":"Genetic and environmental analysis of dystocia and stillbirths in draft horses.","abstract":"Genetic parameters and environmental factors were estimated for foaling ease (FE) and stillbirths (SBs) in four breeds of draft horses based on 11 229, 38 877, 35 764 and 13 274 FE and SB scores recorded between 1998 and 2010 for Ardennais (A), Breton (B), Comtois (C) and Percheron (P), respectively. Incidences for the three FE categories were: easy or without help 91.0% (A) to 95.4% (B), difficult 3.4% (B) to 7.1% (A) and intervention of a veterinarian 1.1% (B) to 1.9% (A). The frequency of SB ranged between 5.4% (B) and 9.4% (A). A multiple-trait threshold animal model was used that included the effects of sex of foal, region, month, year of foaling, combined maternal age and parity, direct genetic, maternal genetic and permanent environments. Estimates were obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Gibbs sampling. The most unfavourable effect was first parity, which decreased the probability of easy foaling to 78.6% for A and 88.3% for B. Interaction with age showed that the risk for first foaling for mares aged 3 years was higher than at 4 or 5 to 9 years. This was also observed for SB with an increased probability of SB at first foaling of 17.9% (A) or 9.6% (B). The most unfavourable month was found to be the most frequent month for foaling (April) and not the most demanding months weather-wise (winter). For FE, direct heritabilities were A 0.27 (0.06), B 0.14 (0.03), C 0.18 (0.03) and P 0.18 (0.04), and maternal heritabilities were A 0.25 (0.06), B 0.19 (0.04), C 0.12 (0.03) and P 0.21 (0.06). Genetic correlations between direct and maternal genetic effects were A -0.29 (0.14), B -0.39 (0.12), C -0.09 (0.14) and P -0.54 (0.17). For SB, direct heritabilities were A 0.52 (0.09), B 0.42 (0.04), C 0.28 (0.04) and P 0.39 (0.05), and maternal heritabilities were A 0.25 (0.05), B 0.10 (0.02), C 0.07 (0.02) and P 0.14 (0.02). Genetic correlations between direct and maternal genetic effects were A -0.85 (0.06), B -0.63 (0.06), C -0.64 (0.11) and P -0.69 (0.06). Direct genetic correlations between FE and SB traits were A 0.60 (0.10), B 0.58 (0.10), C 0.36 (0.10) and P 0.29 (0.15). Maternal genetic correlations between FE and SB traits were A 0.67 (0.10), B 0.47 (0.13), C 0.28 (0.15) and P 0.39 (0.15). These estimates are posterior means of the Gibbs samples and are within the upper limits of comparable results reported in cattle.
