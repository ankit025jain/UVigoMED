{"id":86564,"title":"CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ lymphocyte subgroups and their surface receptors NKG2D and NKG2A in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","abstract":"To explore the prevalence of lymphocyte subgroups CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ and their surface receptors NKG2D and NKG2A in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).A total of 40 patients with NSCLC were divided into different groups according to different clinical factors (TNM staging, pathological patterns and genders) for assessment of relations with CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ and the surface receptors NKG2D and NKG2A of T lymphocytes in peripheral blood by flow cytometry.Patients in the advanced group had evidently lower levels of CD3+ CD4+ but markedly higher levels of CD3+ CD8+ in peripheral blood than those with early lesions (p<0.05). In addition, NSCLC patients in the advanced group had obviously higher CD3+ CD4+ NKG2D and CD3+ CD8+ NKG2A expression rates but lower CD3+ CD4+ NKG2A and CD3+ CD8+ NKG2D expression rates (p<0.05). However, there were no significant differences between NSCLC patients with different genders and pathological patterns in expression levels of lymphocyte subgroups CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ and their surface receptors NKG2D and NKG2A.Unbalanced expression of surface receptors NKG2D and NKG2A in CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ lymphocytes may be associated with a poor prognosis, greater malignancy and immunological evasion by advanced cancers, related to progression of lung cancer.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761885","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.867148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.807775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.807764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.772623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.574244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.552683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.42381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.384677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.28786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.0498974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"NKG2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKG2"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"}]}
