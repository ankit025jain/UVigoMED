{"id":79462,"title":"[Effect of postaurical subcutaneously injection of triamcinolone acetonide for subjective tinnitus].","abstract":"To determine whether postaurical subcutaneous injection of triamcinolone acetonide is effective for subjective tinnitus refractory to medical treatment.A total of 100 adult patients with subjective tinnitus of cochlear origin were randomly assigned to receive postaurical subcutaneous.Injection of either triamcinolone acetonide (n = 50) or saline solution (n = 50). The treatment protocol comprised 5 injections, one per week for 5 weeks.Improvement was measured by tinnitus severity evaluation index evaluation scale, at baseline and one week after the last injection. The follow-up period was 6 months.No significant difference existed between two groups regarding age, gender, pure tone average, pretreatment tinnitus intensity, tinnitus duration or hearing loss level tinnitus duration (P = 0.316,0.685,0.839,0.682 and 0.881 respectively).No significant post-treatment changes in the tinnitus severity index (experimental group = 52%, control group = 44%) were observed in either group (P = 0.724). The most frequently encountered side effect was pain during injection.The postaurical subcutaneous injection of triamcinolone acetonide has no obvious benefit compared with placebo for subjective tinnitus of cochlear origin refractory to medical treatment.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418037","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.774944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.732987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.540434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.418894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Acetone","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.204537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.0990466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0940019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Pure tone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone"},{"name":"Triamcinolone acetonide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone_acetonide"},{"name":"Triamcinolone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"839","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/839"},{"name":"685","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/685"},{"name":"682","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/682"},{"name":"881","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/881"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Pitch (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
