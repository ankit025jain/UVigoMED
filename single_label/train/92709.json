{"id":92709,"title":"Contributions of B cells to lupus pathogenesis.","abstract":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies. This review summarizes first the results obtained in the mouse that have revealed how B cell tolerance is breached in SLE. We then review the B cell subsets, in addition to the autoAb producing cells, which contribute to SLE pathogenesis, focusing on marginal zone B cells, B-1 cells and regulatory B cells. Finally, we review the interactions between B cells and other immune cells that have been implicated in SLE, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils and T cells.
