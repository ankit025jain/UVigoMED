{"id":84859,"title":"[Efficacy observation on navel-warming therapy combined with western medication for yang-deficiency tympanites].","abstract":"To observe the effects of navel-warming therapy on clinical efficacy in patients with yang-deficiency tympanites based on regular treatment of western medication.One hundred and twenty cases of yang-deficiency tympanites were randomly divided into a navel-warming therapy group and a western medication group, sixty cases in each one. The regular treatment of western medicine was applied in the western medication group, including oral administration of antiviral drug and diuretics as well as intravenous drip of hepatic protector. Based on western medicine treatment, the navel-warming therapy was applied in the navel-warming group. A medical cake was laid on Shenque (CV 8), and then a medical cylinder was placed above the medical cake and ignited. The treatment was given once daily. One month was considered as a treatment session in both groups and totally one session was required. The TCM symptom score, B-ultrasound ascites and temporary use of diuretics before and after treatment were observed in both groups; also the efficacy was evaluated.The total effective rate was 81.7% (49/60) in the navel-warming therapy group, which was superior to 56.7% (34/60) in the western medication group (P < 0.05). After the treatment, the TCM symptom score and ascites were improved in both groups (all P < 0.05), which was more significant in the navel-warming therapy group (all P < 0.05). The temporary use of diuretics was statistically different between the two groups (P < 0.05), indicating the navel-warming therapy group could obviously reduce or stop the use of diuretics.Based on regular treatment of western medication, the navel-warming therapy could significantly improve therapeutic efficacy, effectively relieve clinical symptoms and ease ascites.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022130","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.541321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.366486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Tympanites","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanites"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Support group","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Cake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
