{"id":34950,"title":"Bochdalek hernia causing type II respiratory failure in an elderly patient.","abstract":"Bochdalek hernias occur as a result of a congenital defect in the diaphragm enabling abdominal viscera to enter the thoracic cavity restricting lung expansion and ventilation. Bochdalek hernias, in the majority of cases, present in neonates and very rarely in adults. To the best of our knowledge, there are only four published cases of Bochdalek hernia in the adult population causing respiratory failure. We present the case of an 87-year-old woman who had three admissions in the past 6 months with type II respiratory failure due to a Bochdalek hernia which we believe was congenital but had gradually increased in size over the years to cause progressive decompensation with acute exacerbations requiring non-invasive ventilation.
