{"id":73549,"title":"Factors associated to persistence with hormonal therapy in women with breast cancer.","abstract":"To analyze factors associated with persistence to breast cancer hormone therapy in order to contribute to the quality of care improvement.Retrospective longitudinal study, based on secondary data. A cohort of 5,861 women with breast cancer registered in different datasets of the Brazilian National Cancer Institute and the Brazilian Unified Health System were analyzed. All women were treated at this hospital, which provides free medication, and the follow-up period was from January 2004 to October 2010. Sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical variables, as well as aspects of lifestyle and health care, were considered in the explanation of variations in the persistence to hormone therapy, applying the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazard model.Overall persistence to hormone therapy was 79.0% at the end of the first year, and 31.0% in five years of treatment. The risk of discontinuing hormone therapy was higher among women under 35 years old, with more advanced disease (stages III and IV), alcohol drinkers, those undergoing chemotherapy, and for each additional hospitalization, exam performed, and month between diagnosis and beginning of treatment. In the opposite direction, the risk of discontinuity was lower among women who had at least finished high school, those with partner, with a family history of cancer, those who had undergone breast surgery, and who had outpatient visits to a Mastologist, and a Clinical Oncologist.The majority of the women with breast cancer (69.0%) do not persist with hormone treatment for the five years recommended, increasing the risk of inadequate clinical results. The results show aspects of care that can provide better results.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24897050","annotations":[{"name":"National Cancer
