{"id":8431,"title":"Lymphocyte-based model systems for allergy research: a historic overview.","abstract":"During the last decades, a multitude of studies applying distinct in vitro and in vivo model systems have contributed greatly to our better understanding of the initiation and regulation of inflammatory processes leading to allergic diseases. Over the years, it has become evident that among lymphocytes, not only IgE-producing B cells and allergy-orchestrating CD4(+) helper cells but also cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, ??-T cells and innate lymphoid cells, as well as regulatory lymphocytes, might critically shape the immune response towards usually innocuous allergens. In this review, we provide a historic overview of pioneering work leading to the establishment of important lymphocyte-based model systems for allergy research. Moreover, we contrast the original findings with our currently more refined knowledge to appreciate the actual validity of the respective models and to reassess the conclusions obtained from them. Conflicting studies and interpretations are identified and discussed. The tables are intended to provide an easy overview of the field not only for scientists newly entering the field but also for the broader readership interested in updating their knowledge. Along those lines, herein we discuss in vitro and in vivo approaches to the investigation of lymphocyte effector cell activation, polarization and regulation, and describe depletion and adoptive transfer models along with gene knockout and transgenic (tg) methodologies. In addition, novel attempts to establish humanized T cell antigen receptor tg mouse models for allergy research are described and discussed.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777172","annotations":[{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.887116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.864272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.827743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.791877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.725175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.683497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.618628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.598597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Scientist","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
