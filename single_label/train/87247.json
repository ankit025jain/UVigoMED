{"id":87247,"title":"[Pathogenic variants of brain injuries and pharmalogic cerebroprotection performed on the model of brain condition during cardiovascular bypass surgery].","abstract":"Developed and approved a pathogenic grounded experimental model of brain condition during cardiovascular bypass surgery. Undertaken in Wistar rats research allowed to evaluate in detail effectiveness and safety of protracted cerebroprotective treatment. Advantages of this model are researches in laboratory animals with the aim to research condition of nerve tissue, not intensive procedures and consequently high reproducibility and possibility of complex evaluation of changes at every stage of research. Results of neurons, neuroglia and activation of neurotrophic mechanisms prove that simulation of brain condition during cardiovascular bypass surgery is accompanied with acute and delayed brain injuries. Use of Cytoflavin under pharmalogic cerebroprotection had prolonged multimodal and neuroprotactive effect, leading to improvement of neurotrophic protection from the first days.","date":"2014-12-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25532310","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroglia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.739275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Nervous tissue","weight":0.448395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_tissue"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.35351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.339074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.261987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Neurotrophin","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.101002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Ground (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(electricity)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"}]}
