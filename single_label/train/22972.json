{"id":22972,"title":"Characterization of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing diarrheagenic Escherichia coli isolates in the Republic of Korea during 2008-2011.","abstract":"To characterize the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in diarrheagenic Escherichia coli from Korea in 2008-2011, we screened seven enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and one enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) that produce ESBLs from a nationwide survey. All eight isolates produced CTX-M-type ESBLs, including CTX-M-12 (n = 4), CTX-M-14 (n = 2), and CTX-M-15 (n = 2). PCR-based replicon typing indicated that the blaCTX-M-12 genes of four ETEC isolates were carried on a conjugative IncF plasmid, whereas the blaCTX-M-14 of one EAEC was located on an IncK plasmid. This is the first report of the occurrence of blaCTX-M genes in clinical isolates of EAEC in Korea. The ESBL-producing isolates were shown to be different based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing, whereas the four isolates with CTX-M-12 were clonally related. These observations raise an alarm for the spread of plasmid-mediated resistance to ESBL among diarrheagenic E. coli.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509253","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.518098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.504751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.475614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.383876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Bacterial conjugation","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.111393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Replicon (genetics)","weight":0.0563762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicon_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"Alarm devices","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_devices"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Enterotoxin","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxin"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"}]}
