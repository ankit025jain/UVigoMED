{"id":54417,"title":"[The effect of environmental factors and DNA methylation on type 2 diabetes mellitus].","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a glucose metabolic disorder driven by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent DNA methylation studies have established that T2DM may be contributed by environmental factors through the regulation of DNA methylation. Human and animal model studies have made much progress on the interaction between DNA methylation of T2DM genes and environmental factors in multiple tissues. Current studies on DNA methylation of T2DM genes mainly focus on glucose and energy metabolism, inflammation, and so on. This review comprehensively introduces the DNA methylation studies for the genes involved in T2DM and its related environmental factors.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459888","annotations":[{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.405451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Bioenergetics","weight":0.283325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics"},{"name":"Nature versus nurture","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
