{"id":77018,"title":"The double-edged sword of vitamin D in Ireland: the need for public health awareness about too much as well as too little.","abstract":"The Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2011 on dietary references intakes for calcium and vitamin D specified that a 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level below 30 nmol/L indicated risk of deficiency and that a level above 125 nmol/L indicated risk of harm.We noted a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (23.9 %) and a substantive prevalence of hypervitaminosis D (4.8 %) in a retrospective audit of clinical samples (n = 10,181) obtained over 10 months in 2013.Hypovitaminosis D should be corrected by low dose supplementation (5 µg or 200 IU daily) with some at-risk groups needing higher doses (10 µg or 400 IU daily) based on 25OHD levels. Whereas, those taking high-dose vitamin D supplements based on mistaken beliefs about recently authorised claims of benefit for muscle function and misleading unauthorised claims need to be alerted to the potential harms of excessive supplementation.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859288","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.807613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Institute of Medicine","weight":0.802585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.63546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.298354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Vitamin poisoning","weight":0.137782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_poisoning"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Hypervitaminosis D","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Harms (policy debate)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harms_(policy_debate)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Substantive","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive"},{"name":"Sword","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"}]}
