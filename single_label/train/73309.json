{"id":73309,"title":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in Chinese children: a retrospective study of age-specific prevalence.","abstract":"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a globally prevalent herpesvirus associated with infectious mononucleosis and many malignancies. The survey on EBV prevalence appears to be important to study EBV-related diseases and determine when to administer prophylactic vaccine. The purpose of this retrospective study was to collect baseline information about the prevalence of EBV infection in Chinese children.We collected 1778 serum samples from healthy children aged 0 to 10, who were enrolled in conventional health and nutrition examinations without any EBV-related symptom in 2012 and 2013 in North China (n?=?973) and South China (n?=?805). We detected four EBV-specific antibodies, i.e., anti-VCA-IgG and IgM, anti-EBNA-IgG and anti-EA-IgG, by ELISA, representing all of the phases of EBV infection. The overall EBV seroprevalence in samples from North and South China were 80.78% and 79.38% respectively. The EBV seropositivity rates dropped slightly at age 2, and then increased gradually with age. The seroprevalence became stabilized at over 90% after age 8. In this study, the seroprevalence trends between North and South China showed no difference (P>0.05), and the trends of average antibody concentrations were similar as well (P>0.05).EBV seroprevalence became more than 50% before age 3 in Chinese children, and exceed 90% after age 8. This study can be helpful to study the relationship between EBV and EBV-associated diseases, and supportive to EBV vaccine development and implementation.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914816","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Infectious mononucleosis","weight":0.799068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"China","weight":0.620691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.62,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.578368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.577889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.425666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.386135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.269585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.237942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0562587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Northern and southern China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
