{"id":87706,"title":"[Epidemiological features of 877 cases with hip fraction].","abstract":"To analyze the epidemiological features of hip fraction, and to improve the intervention program on this disease.To investigate the clinical data of the patients with hip fraction who were treated at local hospitals, from Jan. to Dec., 2012. Information regarding sex, age, site and cause of the fracture was analyzed.877 cases were treated at the local hospitals; including 516 males (58.84%) and 361 females (41.16%). The overall incidence of hip fraction was 10.0/100 000, with 11.2/100 000 in males and 8.8/100 000 in females. The incidence was higher in males than that in females (?² = 4.281, P = 0.033). Age distribution of the patients was: 344 cases in age 71-82 (39.22%), 196 cases in age 61-70 (22.35%) and 185 cases in age 51-60 (21.09%). Transcervical fracture appeared more than intertrochanteric fracture of femur (?² = 21.423, P < 0.001), with males more than females in both fractures on femur (?² = 12.816, P < 0.001; ?² = 13.773, P < 0.001). The top 3 factors causing hip fractions would contain tumble (64.88%), falling (20.07%) and traffic accident (10.49%).Incidence of hip fraction would increase with age with tumble as the major cause to it.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009039","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.206125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0222132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"816","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/816"},{"name":"877","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/877"},{"name":"423","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/423"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"344","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/344"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 8100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_8100"},{"name":"Uncial 0100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0100"}]}
