{"id":82601,"title":"Clinical performance of fiber-reinforced nanofilled resin composite in extensively carious posterior teeth of children: 30-month evaluation.","abstract":"To evaluate the 30-month clinical performance of a nanofilled-resin composite with or without glass-fiber layering in restorations of large cavities in posterior teeth of children.A total of 71 restorations were placed in permanent molar teeth of 47 children (mean age 10.9 years) with (FRC; n=35) or without (RC; n=36) fiber layering. One operator placed all restorations. Restorations were evaluated according to the USPHS modified-Ryge criteria at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. The data were analyzed using Fisher 's exact and chi-square tests and outcomes were compared using the Cochran-Q test (p<0.05).The 30-month survival rates of the restorations were 97% and 97.1% in the RC and FRC groups, respectively. Nanofilled-resin restorations with or without glass fiber-layering showed similarly high clinical performance. No differences were detected between the evaluated criteria when comparing baseline with any of the evaluation periods (p<0.05). After 30 months there were no secondary caries, change in anatomical form or postoperative sensitivity. Only minor changes for marginal adaptation, marginal discoloration, color match and surface texture were observed.It was concluded that nanofilled-resin composite applied with or without glass-fiber layering showed similar and good results in large cavities of posterior permanent teeth in children over a 30-month period.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579274","annotations":[{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.641821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.422037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.397256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.366738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.358118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.312605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.155226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.136607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"United States Public Health Service","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Public_Health_Service"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ronald Fisher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Catholic Church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"},{"name":"Clinical governance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_governance"},{"name":"Surface finish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_finish"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Layering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layering"},{"name":"Mouthfeel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthfeel"}]}
