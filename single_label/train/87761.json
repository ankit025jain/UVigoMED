{"id":87761,"title":"Imaging of the patellofemoral joint.","abstract":"The patellofemoral (PF) joint is a complex articulation, with interplay between the osseous and soft tissue structures to maintain the balance between knee mobility and stability. Disorders of the PF joint can be a source of anterior knee pain (AKP). In this article, radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging of the PF joint are reviewed, including normal anatomy, imaging techniques, and imaging-based measurements. Common imaging findings associated with AKP are reviewed, including symptomatic normal variants, tendinopathy, apophysitis, osteoarthritis, chondromalacia patella, trochlear dysplasia, excessive lateralization of tibial tuberosity, patellar maltracking, patellar dislocation and fractures, anterior bursitis, Morel-Lavall√©e effusions, and fat pad edema.
