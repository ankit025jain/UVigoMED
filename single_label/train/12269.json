{"id":12269,"title":"Cardiolipin content is involved in liver mitochondrial energy wasting associated with cancer-induced cachexia without the involvement of adenine nucleotide translocase.","abstract":"Cancer-induced cachexia describes the progressive skeletal muscle wasting associated with many cancers leading to shortened survival time in cancer patients. We previously reported that cardiolipin content and energy-wasting processes were both increased in liver mitochondria in a rat model of peritoneal carcinosis (PC)-induced cachexia. To increase the understanding of the cellular biology of cancer cachexia, we investigated the involvement of adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) in mitochondrial energy-wasting processes in liver mitochondria of PC and pair-fed control rats and its interactions with cardiolipin in isolated liver mitochondria from healthy rats exposed to cardiolipin-enriched liposomes. We showed in this study that functional ANT content was decreased in liver mitochondria from PC rats but without any effects on the efficiency of ATP synthesis. Moreover, non-phosphorylating energy wasting was not affected by saturating concentrations of carboxyatractylate (CAT), a potent inhibitor of ANT, in liver mitochondria from PC rats. Decreased efficiency of ATP synthesis was found in normal liver mitochondria exposed to cardiolipin-enriched liposomes, with increased non-phosphorylating energy wasting, thus mimicking mitochondria from PC rats. However, the functional ANT content in these cardiolipin-enriched mitochondria was unchanged, although non-phosphorylating energy wasting was reduced by CAT-induced inhibition of ANT. Finally, non-phosphorylating energy wasting was increased in cardiolipin-enriched mitochondria with substrates for complexes 1 and 2, but not for complex 4. In conclusion, increased energy wasting measured in liver mitochondria from rats with cancer cachexia is dependent on cardiolipin but independent of ANT. Interactions between ANT and cardiolipin are modified when cancer cachexia occurs.
