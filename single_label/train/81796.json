{"id":81796,"title":"Platform switch versus platform match in the posterior mandible â€“ 1-year results of a multicentre randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"The purpose of this ongoing randomized study was to assess differences in bone level changes and success rates using implants supporting single crowns in the posterior mandible either with platform matched or platform switched abutments.Patients aged 18 and above, missing at least two teeth in the posterior mandible and with a natural tooth mesial to the most proximal implant site were enrolled. Randomization followed implant placement. Definitive restorations were placed after a minimum transgingival healing period of 8 weeks. Changes in crestal bone level from surgery and loading (baseline) to 12-month post-loading were radiographically measured. Implant survival and success were determined.Sixty-eight patients received 74 implants in the platform switching group and 72 in the other one. The difference of mean marginal bone level change from surgery to 12 months was significant between groups (p < 0.004). Radiographical mean bone gain or no bone loss from loading was noted for 67.1% of the platform switching and 49.2% of the platform matching implants. Implant success rates were 97.3% and 100%, respectively.Within the same implant system the platform switching concept showed a positive effect on marginal bone levels when compared with restorations with platform matching.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829969","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.820698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.775158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.692303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.482045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.247187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.202301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.198495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.124895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0891297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0547413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0471159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"1 myriametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_myriametre"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Marginal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution"},{"name":"Matching (graph theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"}]}
