{"id":76627,"title":"Linezolid-induced lactic acidosis corrected with sustained low-efficiency dialysis: a case report.","abstract":"Linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, has been reported to increase the risk of lactic acidosis and peripheral neuropathy because it disrupts mitochondrial function. This case report describes the development of lactic acidosis in a 63-year-old man who had received 3 months of treatment with intravenous linezolid for pulmonary nocardiasis, and correction of the acidotic state with sustained low-efficiency dialysis. This case demonstrates that renal replacement therapy can be an alternative to discontinuation alone for rapid reversal of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis.
