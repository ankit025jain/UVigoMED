{"id":24767,"title":"Aortic regurgitation due to fibrous strand rupture in the fenestrated left coronary cusp of the tricuspid aortic valve.","abstract":"Fenestration-related massive aortic regurgitation is rare. The underlying mechanism is reported to be rupture of the fenestrated fibrous strand, and most ruptured cords have been reported in the bicuspid valve or in the right coronary cusp of the tricuspid aortic valve. We encountered a rare case of acute aortic regurgitation due to fibrous strand rupture in the fenestrated left coronary cusp. Preoperative echocardiography detected left coronary cusp prolapse, and operative findings revealed rupture of a fibrous strand in the left coronary cusp. For cases such as this, preoperative echocardiography would be useful for appropriate diagnosis.
