{"id":39981,"title":"[Effects of 2-(2-hydroxyphenoxy) acetyl-L-prolinate sodium on antioxidant defense system of the gastric mucosa of rats under conditions of stress action].","abstract":"We investigated the preventive effect of low molecular weight organic compound 2-(2-hydroxyphenoxy) acetyl-L-prolinat sodium on erosive and ulcerative lesions in the gastric mucosa caused by stress. It was established that prophylactic administration of this substance to rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg reduced the lesion area by 56.7%. 2-(2-hydroxyphenoxy) acetyl-L-prolinat sodium efficiently restored the impaired pro-/antioxidative balance in the gastric mucosa of rats under stress: the content of diene conjugates was reduced by 1.24 times, TBA-active products reduced by 1.31 times, Schiff's bases reduced by 1.28 times. This effect was accompanied by increased activities of the superoxide dismutase, catalase and of glutathione system.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095673","annotations":[{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.917307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.716307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.667072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.657745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.657429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.492399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diene","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diene"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.289281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.197378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.177919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.122974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
