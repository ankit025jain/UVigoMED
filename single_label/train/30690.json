{"id":30690,"title":"[Rhabdomyolysis as an unspecyfic symptom of mushroom poisoning--a case report].","abstract":"Since 2001 a number of cases of mushroom poisoning with concomitant rhabdomyolysis have been described. Among the edible mushrooms growing in Europe, these reports concerned only Tricholoma equestre. The results of animal studies suggest that rhabdomyolysis could be a consequence of consumption of other edible fungi, and its occurrence depends on the amount of ingested mushrooms and individual sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of rhabdomyolysis associated with the consumption of edible mushrooms from Leccinum and Boletus species. A 57-years old man was admitted to the hospital due to severe pain and weakness of thigh muscles with a high serum creatine kinase activity -3811 U/L. Within two days before hospitalization he consumed repeatedly large quantities of stewed Leccinum and Boletus mushrooms. Clinical signs of toxicity and biochemical changes subsided after several days of hospitalization. Rhabdomyolysis after ingestion of a large amount of mushrooms can be an unspecific symptom, unrelated to fungi species.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466721","annotations":[{"name":"Rhabdomyolysis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.821829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.619526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.61029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Tricholoma equestre","weight":0.578049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricholoma_equestre"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.566066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mushroom poisoning","weight":0.488317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_poisoning"},{"name":"Mushroom","weight":0.48797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.371518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.327706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.264771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.246949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.198172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0312312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Tricholoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricholoma"},{"name":"Boletus","weight":0.0235292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus"},{"name":"Stew","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Edible mushroom","weight":0.0125579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_mushroom"}]}
