{"id":87324,"title":"[Microdestruction of the bone].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was the detection of microcracks in the compact bone tissue surrounding the fracture and in deformed bone undergoing subcritical loading. The portions of deformed bone tissue and terminal fragments of broken bones were obtained in the form of blocks longitudinally sawcut from the regions of primary and secondary bone rupture. A total of 300 such blocks were available for the examination. All portions of the deformed bone tissue and terminal fragments of broken bones showed up microcracks commensurate with the bone structures. They were actually hardened traces of deformation that preceded the fracture and reflected the volume of the destroyed bone tissue; moreover, in certain cases they allowed to identify the kind of the object that exerted the external action (either a blow or slow bending).","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269164","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.540985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.225833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.0419679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Compact space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Critical mass","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass"}]}
