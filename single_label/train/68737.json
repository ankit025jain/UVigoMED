{"id":68737,"title":"Predictive value of clinicopathological markers for the metachronous bladder cancer and prognosis of upper tract urothelial carcinoma.","abstract":"Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is rare but aggressive with poor prognosis. We aimed to find effective predictive markers for recurrence and prognosis in UTUC patients. In this retrospective study, we included 88 UTUC patients treated with radical neprhoureterectomy (RNU) and analyzed their clinicopathological parameters. For study of incidence of metachronous bladder tumor, models were adjusted with inclusion of prophylactic intravesical instillation chemotherapy. The mean follow-up was 28.59 months (2 to 82 mo). Lack of gross hematuria (RR 0.060, 95%CI 0.008-0.468), tumor located at ureter (RR 0.037, 95%CI 0.004-0.378), advanced stage and higher p53 expression were independent factors for worse survival. Recurrence of bladder cancer occurred 20% of patients at median follow-up of 37.65 months (5 to 82 mo). Higher tumor grade (RR 5.998, 95%CI 1.359-26.479) and presence of ipsilateral non-functioning kidney at diagnosis (RR 5.982, 95%CI 1.338-26.750) were predictors for recurrence. The present study identified several parameters with predictive value in the prognosis and intravesicle recurrence in UTUCand shed light on the better monitoring and management of the disease.
