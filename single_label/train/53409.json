{"id":53409,"title":"Surgical management and long-term follow-up of solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas: a large series from a single institution.","abstract":"We summarized the diagnosis, surgical strategies, and long-term follow-up outcomes in our large series of solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPTs) of pancreas.In this retrospective analysis, we collected data pertaining to pancreatic SPTs diagnosed in 115 patients between July 2003 and February 2013.We analyzed the demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, operative strategies, perioperative details, and follow-up outcomes.Abdominal pain was the most frequent symptom (40.0%). The most frequent location of SPT was pancreatic tail (36.5%). We performed 33 cases of pancreaticoduodenectomy, 15 cases of middle pancreatectomy, 19 cases of distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation, 28 cases of distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, and 18 cases of enucleation. Two patients suffered tumor recurrence and required a second resection of the recurrent tumor.Complete resection of the tumor is associated with good survival, even in patients with vessel involvement or metastases. In patients with tumor recurrence, a second resection resulted in long-term survival.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519038","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.710201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.537436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.503788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.429832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.240541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0506351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tail of pancreas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_of_pancreas"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Strathclyde Partnership for Transport","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathclyde_Partnership_for_Transport"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
