{"id":67093,"title":"[In vitro fertilization and intracystoplasmic sperm injection].","abstract":"In vitro fertilization with or without microinjection has revolutionized the treatment of infertility. It is useful in almost all causes of sterility. But these results are still modest and far from the expectations of couples since 25% patients deliver after an attempt and 40 to 50% after several attempts. There is a risk of immediate complications but it is today well control. The long-term studies on the children development and the women health are very reassuring.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649557","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.810184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.627932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.537356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.475486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.401498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.278514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.143643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Microinjection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microinjection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Well control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_control"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
