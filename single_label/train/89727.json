{"id":89727,"title":"Subtalar joint stress imaging with tomosynthesis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to perform stress imaging of hindfoot inversion and eversion using tomosynthesis and to assess the subtalar joint range of motion (ROM) of healthy subjects. The subjects were 15 healthy volunteers with a mean age of 29.1 years. Coronal tomosynthesis stress imaging of the subtalar joint was performed in a total of 30 left and right ankles. A Telos stress device was used for the stress load, and the load was 150 N for both inversion and eversion. Tomographic images in which the posterior talocalcaneal joint could be confirmed on the neutral position images were used in measurements. The angle of the intersection formed by a line through the lateral articular facet of the posterior talocalcaneal joint and a line through the surface of the trochlea of the talus was measured. The mean change in the angle of the calcaneus with respect to the talus was 10.3 ± 4.8° with inversion stress and 5.0 ± 3.8° with eversion stress from the neutral position. The result was a clearer depiction of the subtalar joint, and inversion and eversion ROM of the subtalar joint was shown to be about 15° in healthy subjects.Diagnostic, Level IV.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686905","annotations":[{"name":"Calcaneus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.575058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Subtalar joint","weight":0.197222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtalar_joint"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Trochlea of humerus","weight":0.0649999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochlea_of_humerus"},{"name":"Talus bone","weight":0.0558604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talus_bone"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Articular facet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular_facet"},{"name":"Tomosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomosynthesis"},{"name":"Eversion (kinesiology)","weight":0.019165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eversion_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Intersection (road)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(road)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Zygapophysial joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygapophysial_joint"},{"name":"Inversion (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Read-only memory","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Coronal plane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_plane"},{"name":"Grappling position","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling_position"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
