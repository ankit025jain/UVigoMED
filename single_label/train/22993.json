{"id":22993,"title":"A review of methylene blue treatment for cardiovascular collapse.","abstract":"Historically, methylene blue (MB) has been used for multiple purposes, including as an antidote for toxin-induced and hereditary methemoglobinemia, ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, and ackee fruit and cyanide poisoning; as an aniline dye derivative, antimalarial agent, and antidepressant.Most recently, the use of MB has been advocated as a potential adjunct in the treatment of shock states. Our article reviews the role of MB in septic shock, anaphylactic shock, and toxin-induced shock. MB is proposed to increase blood pressure in these shock states by interfering with guanylate cyclase activity, and preventing cyclic guanosine monophosphate production and vasodilatation.MB may be an adjunct in the treatment of septic shock, anaphylactic shock, and toxin-induced shock.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508113","annotations":[{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.829174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Methemoglobinemia","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobinemia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.760863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Cyanide","weight":0.738291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide"},{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Anaphylactic shock","weight":0.660116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylactic_shock"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Methylene blue","weight":0.542693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"},{"name":"Cyclic guanosine monophosphate","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_guanosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.447847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.446933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Aniline","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniline"},{"name":"Antimalarial medication","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication"},{"name":"Guanylate cyclase","weight":0.432629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanylate_cyclase"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Cyanide poisoning","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.209363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Mauveine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauveine"},{"name":"Guanosine monophosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Circulatory collapse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_collapse"},{"name":"Guanosine","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cyclic compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound"}]}
