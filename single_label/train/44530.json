{"id":44530,"title":"Biodegradable and thermosensitive monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic acid) hydrogel as a barrier for prevention of post-operative abdominal adhesion.","abstract":"Post-operative peritoneal adhesions are serious consequences of abdominal or pelvic surgery and cause severe bowel obstruction, chronic pelvic pain and infertility. In this study, a novel nano-hydrogel system based on a monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic acid) (MPEG-PLA) di-block copolymer was studied for its ability to prevent abdominal adhesion in rats. The MPEG-PLA hydrogel at a concentration of 40% (w/v) was injected and was able to adhere to defect sites at body temperature. The ability of the hydrogel to inhibit adhesion of post-operative tissues was evaluated by utilizing a rat model of abdominal sidewall-cecum abrasion. It was possible to heal wounded tissue through regeneration of neo-peritoneal tissues ten days after surgery. Our data showed that this hydrogel system is equally as effective as current commercialized anti-adhesive products.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730238","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.764018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.624547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.581101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.50336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.481416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.345291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.3113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Thermoregulation","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.254924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.138374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.114958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Pelvic pain","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_pain"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0424438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Copolymer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
