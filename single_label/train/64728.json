{"id":64728,"title":"[Mechanism of eosinophil apoptosis and its regulation in allergic reaction].","abstract":"In allergic reaction activated eosinophils have been known to accumulate at the site of inflamma tion. Apoptosis of eosinophils may be involved in the inflammation resolution. In this review, we state that the apoptosis of eosinophils play a direct role in allergic reaction. Regulating the apoptosis of eosinophils can effectively alter the development of allergic inflammatory reaction.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007686","annotations":[{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"}]}
