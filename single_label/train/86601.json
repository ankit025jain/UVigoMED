{"id":86601,"title":"[Advances of the relationship between leptin system and non-small cell lung cancer].","abstract":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????T??????????????????????????????????????????????Leptin system plays an important role in lung inflammation and tumorigenesis, but the precise function in the tumormicrovironment and the prognosis value of the leptin system in lung cancer have not been fully elucidated. This review will focus on the relationship between leptin system and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in which special attentions will be paid on the expression of leption and its receptor (LepR) in peripheral blood and tumor tissues, leptin-related signal transduction pathways, the interaction between leption and regulatory T cells (Treg) and the gene polymorphisms of leptin and leptin receptor, and possibly provide new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC.
