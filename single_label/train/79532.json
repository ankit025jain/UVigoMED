{"id":79532,"title":"High incidence of Plasmodium vivax malaria in newly arrived Eritrean refugees in Sweden since May 2014.","abstract":"Since May 2014, an increase in Plasmodium vivax malaria has been observed in Sweden. As of 31 August 2014, 105 malaria cases have been reported in newly arrived Eritrean refugees, 84 of them P. vivax. The patients were mainly young men and reported migration through Ethiopia and/or Sudan. Severe anaemia and long symptom duration reflect inadequate healthcare during migration. Countries currently hosting Eritrean refugees need to consider P. vivax malaria in this group of migrants.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25210980","annotations":[{"name":"Sudan","weight":0.929752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"},{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.777841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.599351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.366738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Eritrea","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.320808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.282061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.238352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.0185404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
