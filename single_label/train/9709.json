{"id":9709,"title":"Novel ruthenium - gamma-linolenic acid complex inhibits C6 rat glioma cell proliferation in vitro and in the orthotopic C6 model in vivo after osmotic pump infusion.","abstract":"Gliomas are primary brain tumours. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) exerts anti-proliferative effects. Several ruthenium-containing complexes have antiproliferative effects and can be used as adjuvant therapies in cisplatin-resistant cancer. The present study reports on the anti-proliferative properties and effects on tumour morphology of a novel diruthenium-GLA complex (Ru2GLA) and its comparison with GLA in the C6 rat glioma model both in vitro and in vivo.In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed on C6 glioma rat cells, and in an orthotopic model.Ru2GLA (100 ?M) appears to be an inhibitor of C6 rat glioma cell proliferation. The nuclear area of Ru2GLA-treated cells was 2.18-times larger than that of control cells, suggesting DNA replication occurred but mitosis was blocked in the G2-M phase. Ru2GLA (2 mM) inhibited C6 cell proliferation in vivo and the changes in tumor morphology confirm both cellular uptake and collagen fibre-binding in the extracellular matrix.Ru2GLA appears to be a low-toxicity drug and a potential candidate for anti-proliferative therapy of glioma.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692725","annotations":[{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.77333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Osmosis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.627743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.601579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.600869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.336641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.197613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Ruthenium","weight":0.0289305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenium"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"G2 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G2_phase"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
