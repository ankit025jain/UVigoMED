{"id":52025,"title":"Analysis of the prognostic significance of lymph node related characteristics in papillary thyroid carcinoma patients presenting with pre- or intra-operative evidence of cervical lymph node metastases.","abstract":"To identify the prognostic significance of specific lymph node related characteristics for disease persistence and recurrence in patients with pre- or intra-operative evidence of neck metastases and no other risk factors.Sixty-eight patients were identified; 50 per cent had persistent or recurrent disease. All underwent the same treatment strategy. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the patient- or tumour-related parameters when patients with and without persistence or recurrence were compared. Patients with recurrent or persistent disease had significantly larger (>3 cm) metastatic lymph nodes, but there were no differences regarding other lymph node related parameters (i.e. number, extracapsular extension, number of lymph nodes with extracapsular extension, and central vs lateral neck location). On multivariate analysis, however, none of the parameters were predictive of persistent or recurrent disease.In papillary thyroid carcinoma patients with no other risk factors, pre- or intra-operative evidence of cervical metastases was associated with a very high rate of disease persistence or recurrence. Specific lymph node characteristics were not shown to have prognostic significance.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636046","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.497652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.49571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.432566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.346029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.279314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.161634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"}]}
