{"id":45165,"title":"Safety and tolerability of rifaximin for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome without constipation: a pooled analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.","abstract":"The efficacy of rifaximin, a nonsystemic, gut-targeted antibiotic for reducing non-constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (non-C IBS) symptoms, has been demonstrated in one phase 2b and two phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, but detailed data about rifaximin safety and tolerability during treatment and subsequent follow-up periods are lacking.To assess and determine the frequency of rifaximin and placebo adverse events (AEs) in phase 2b and phase 3 non-C IBS trials.A post hoc pooled safety analysis of the phase 2b (rifaximin 275, 550, and 1100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks; 550 mg twice daily for 4 weeks) and phase 3 (rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks) studies was performed. Data on treatment and post-treatment AEs were collected. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks and 10 weeks post-treatment in the phase 2b and phase 3 trials, respectively.Patients receiving rifaximin (n = 1103) and placebo (n = 829) had a similar incidence of drug-related AEs (12.1% vs. 10.7%), serious AEs (1.5% vs. 2.2%), drug-related AEs resulting in study discontinuation (0.8% vs. 0.8%), gastrointestinal-associated AEs (12.2% vs. 12.2%) and infection-associated AEs (8.5% vs. 9.5%). There were no cases of Clostridium difficile colitis or deaths.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697851","annotations":[{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.756375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.684374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.58863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.410274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.344936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Rifaximin","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifaximin"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"829","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/829"},{"name":"1100","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1100"},{"name":"1103","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1103"},{"name":"Three-phase electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power"},{"name":"275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/275"},{"name":"Post hoc ergo propter hoc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Two-phase electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_electric_power"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"In phase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_phase"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
