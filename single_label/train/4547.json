{"id":4547,"title":"Case of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease diagnosed by transbronchial lung biopsy and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration.","abstract":"A 62-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of bilateral chest abnormal shadow.His lacrimal, submandibular and parotid glands had been swollen for several years. His serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) level was >1,500 mg/dl, and chest computed tomography showed bilateral reticular opacities with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Transbronchial lung biopsy and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) results suggested IgG4-related disease. This is the first report, to our knowledge, in the English literature showing EBUS-TBNA to be useful for diagnosing IgG4-related disease.
