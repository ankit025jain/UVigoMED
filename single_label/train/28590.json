{"id":28590,"title":"[Genetic predispositions in drug allergy: the role of HLA].","abstract":"The pathophysiology of drug allergy is complex and relies on the interaction between the drug and the immune system in combination with environmental factors, in particular viruses. Genetic predisposition plays an important role in drug allergy. Recent publications have shown the importance of HLA genes, particularly in the delayed hypersensitivity reactions. In fact, particular HLA alleles were identified as risk factors in the development of severe allergic reactions to certain drugs, identifying people at risk of hypersensitivity before initiation of specific treatment. In the future, identification of other alleles in HLA genes will improve patients care by preventing hypersensitivity reactions associated with significant morbidity and mortality.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834645","annotations":[{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.752938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.751024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.545467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.402214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.266486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Type IV hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_IV_hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
