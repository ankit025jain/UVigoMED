{"id":70554,"title":"[Why is it difficult to implement biomedical policy? the case of the Cancéropôles, the French cancer organizations].","abstract":"This article examines the new organizations in cancer research in France called cancéropôles and created in 2003, whose mission is to coordinate actors from industry, research and clinical fields. Our research is based on a study of cancéropôles which embraces an evolutionary perspective on cluster formation and development. Our analysis reveals that although clear differences exist between them, our sample of the three established Cancéropôles display similar patterns of unsuccessful cases. Eventually, the identification of mechanisms that reduce their action in the cancer research environment raises questions about the factors that may influence any public action to a reconfiguration of the French biomedical sector.
