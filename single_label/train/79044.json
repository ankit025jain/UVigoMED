{"id":79044,"title":"Hearing and vertigo outcomes after congenital labyrinthine cholesteatoma resection.","abstract":"Congenital labyrinthine cholesteatoma can cause varying degrees of hearing loss and vertigo. Hearing preservation is not always possible when treatment involves total labyrinthectomy. Since 1969, there have been several case reports and case series documenting hearing preservation following surgical treatment of congenital labyrinthine cholesteatoma. However, none of the case reports or case series documents the patients' vestibular complaints after surgery. Herein, we report a case series of four patients who were treated with the goal of hearing preservation and resolution of vertigo after partial or complete removal of the bony labyrinth for congenital inner ear cholesteatoma. We will also discuss possible explanations for the mechanisms of preservation of hearing and vestibular function with a review of the current literature.
