{"id":89803,"title":"EMAS position statement: The management of postmenopausal women with vertebral osteoporotic fracture.","abstract":"Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are associated with significant morbidity, excess mortality as well as health and social service expenditure. Additionally, women with a prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fracture have a high risk of experiencing a further one within one year. It is therefore important for the physician to use a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for early detection and effective treatment of vertebral fractures.The aim of this position statement is to provide and critically appraise evidence on the management of women with a vertebral osteoporotic fracture.Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.The management of women with osteoporotic vertebral fractures includes measures to reduce pain providing early mobility, to support the affected spine ensuring fracture healing, as well as starting treatment for osteoporosis itself. Any other underlying pathology should be sought and treated. Early detection and treatment is essential as there is an increased risk of further fractures in patients with vertebral fractures. Treatment will depend on the underlying causes of bone loss, efficacy in any particular situation, cost and patient preference.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679890","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.714331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.549112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.54,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.48111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Social work","weight":0.445704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.30913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0643292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Expert witness","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"}]}
