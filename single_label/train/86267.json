{"id":86267,"title":"Major complications after lung microwave ablation: a single-center experience on 204 sessions.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for major complications after microwave ablation (MWA) of lung tumors.From January 2011 to May 2013 in 184 consecutive patients (67 women and 117 men; mean age, 61.5 years; range, 19 to 85 years), 204 sessions of MWA were performed on 253 lung tumor lesions. Records were reviewed to evaluate prevalence of major complications and risk factors, which were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses.Major complications developed after 42 sessions (20.6%), including 32 cases (15.7%) of pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement which that were associated with emphysema (p=0.001); 6 cases (2.9%) of pleural effusions requiring chest tube placement, which were associated with a distance of less than 1 cm from chest wall to target tumor (p=0.014); 6 cases (2.9%) of pneumonia which that were associated with target tumor maximal diameter (p=0.040); number of pleural punctures (p=0.001) and ablation time (p=0.006); and 1 case (0.5%) of pulmonary abscess. Two cases (1.0%) of the large pneumothorax occurred at the same time with extensive subcutaneous emphysema, including 1 case (0.5%) caused by bronchopleural fistula. Death related to the procedures occurred after 1 session (0.5%).As a relatively practical and safe modality, lung tumor MWA can induce serious complications. Enough attention should be paid to patients with emphysema, subpleural, or large target tumor, but the indications for lung MWA need not be limited as most major complications were easily managed.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793688","annotations":[{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Chest tube","weight":0.841674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_tube"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Subcutaneous emphysema","weight":0.713027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_emphysema"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.547666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.363488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.346474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lung abscess","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_abscess"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Kernel mode","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_mode"},{"name":"Microwave","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/253"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Enough","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enough"},{"name":"Manager (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Mystery Writers of America","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Writers_of_America"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
