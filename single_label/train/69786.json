{"id":69786,"title":"Bosutinib plus capecitabine for selected advanced solid tumours: results of a phase 1 dose-escalation study.","abstract":"This phase 1 study evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and efficacy of bosutinib (competitive Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor) plus capecitabine.Patients with locally advanced/metastatic breast, pancreatic, or colorectal cancers; cholangiocarcinoma; or glioblastoma received bosutinib plus capecitabine at eight of nine possible dose combinations using an 'up-down' design to determine the toxicity contour of the combination.Among 32 enrolled patients, none of the 9 patients receiving MTD (bosutinib 300 mg once daily plus capecitabine 1000 mg m(-2) twice daily) experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Overall, 2 out of 31 (6%) evaluable patients experienced DLTs (grade 3 neurologic pain (n=1); grade 3 pruritus/rash and increased alanine aminotransferase (n=1)). Most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), fatigue; most frequent grade 3/4 AEs: PPE, fatigue, and increased alanine/aspartate aminotransferase. Although diarrhoea was common, 91% of affected patients experienced maximum grade 1/2 events that resolved. Best overall confirmed partial response or stable disease >24 weeks (all tumour types) was observed in 6 and 13% of patients.In this population of patients with advanced solid tumours, bosutinib plus capecitabine demonstrated a safety profile similar to that previously reported for bosutinib or capecitabine monotherapy; limited efficacy was observed.","date":"2014-11-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25290090","annotations":[{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.7781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.731565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.640491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.615483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.459734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.449876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.448266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.354795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy-induced_acral_erythema"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
