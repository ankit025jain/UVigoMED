{"id":61390,"title":"[Pathological diagnosis of mature T/NK cell lymphoma].","abstract":"Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) are rare and heterogeneous forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that, in general, are associated with a poor clinical outcome. In addition, many subtypes are present in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of PTCL. To well classify and diagnose the PTCL, clinical, molecular, morphological and phenotypic data are necessary. For example, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I) provirus is necessary for the diagnosis of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). The t(2 : 5) and ALK expression are necessary for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is necessary for NKTCL.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724401","annotations":[{"name":"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_T-cell_leukemia/lymphoma"},{"name":"Provirus","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provirus"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.577889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Anaplasia","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasia"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma","weight":0.202124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_large-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.184771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Human T-lymphotropic virus","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_T-lymphotropic_virus"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_lymphoma_kinase"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
