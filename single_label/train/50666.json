{"id":50666,"title":"Assessment of left ventricular myocardial systolic acceleration in diabetic rats using velocity vector imaging.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate how the myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction changed in rats with diabetic cardiomyopathy and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by using velocity vector imaging.Velocity vector imaging was performed in 12 control rats and 15 rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy 12 weeks after streptozotocin injection. The segmental radial displacement, velocity, acceleration, and percent wall thickening were measured at the mid-left ventricular (LV) level.Compared to control rats, rats with cardiomyopathy had a significant decrease in the peak radial acceleration during isovolumic contraction in most segments of the LV wall (including the anterior, anterolateral, inferolateral, and inferior segments; P < .05) but a similar LVEF, fractional shortening, and segmental displacement. Rats with cardiomyopathy also had a significant increase in LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters when corrected for body mass (P < .001; P = .003, respectively) and a significant decrease in the radial peak systolic velocities of the inferolateral and inferior wall segments (P < .05). In addition, rats with cardiomyopathy had a significant decrease in the peak radial diastolic acceleration in most segments of the LV wall (except for the anterolateral one; P< .05) but similar peak radial diastolic velocities in all LV wall segments compared to controls. Pathologic examination in rats with cardiomyopathy revealed ultrastructural impairment of the capillary and cardiocyte without any atherosclerotic lesion in the coronary artery compared to control rats.Myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction decreases in rats with diabetic cardiomyopathy and a preserved LVEF, suggesting the presence of regional LV systolic dysfunction.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764343","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.837674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.760471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.640061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.54575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Systolic dysfunction","weight":0.289542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_dysfunction"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.125004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.112892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
