{"id":46354,"title":"Discarded organs at Shiraz Transplant Center.","abstract":"This study sought to investigate discarded organs at the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.We performed a retrospective analysis of Shiraz Transplant Center database regarding discarded organ during May 2010 and December 2013. Our study investigated 80 unused liver donors' characteristics. The data included age, sex, cause of discard, cause of brain death, hypotension during hospitalization of donors, and result of liver biopsy.Among 780 grafts, 80 livers (10.25%), between May 2010 and December 2013, were unsuitable for transplant. Among the donors whose livers were discarded, 36 were women (45%) and 44 were men (55%) (mean age, 43.7 Â± 14 years; range, 1-67 y). The most common causes of brain death were cerebrovascular accidents 27 (33.8%), trauma 27 (33.8%), aneurysm, and subarachnoid hemorrhage 13 (16.3%). The most common cause of unused organ were fatty liver 50 (62.5%) and necrosis 25 (31%) (steatosis more than 40%).Old age, cerebrovascular accidents, and severe steatosis ? 40 were the most common associated factors in organ discard in this study.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635823","annotations":[{"name":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.839523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Brain death","weight":0.8073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.774607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.734457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.389104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.33773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Shiraz","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
