{"id":86160,"title":"Management of thoracic endometriosis: single institution experience.","abstract":"Thoracic endometriosis is a relatively rare type of endometriosis and includes catamenial pneumothorax, hemothorax and hemoptysis, and presence of intrathoracic endometriotic nodules. We want to clarify and resume the most appropriate management of this pathology.We retrospectively reviewed all the cases of thoracic endometriosis diagnosed and followed up in our Unit from 2005 to 2013. This search revealed five women, with a mean age of 34.5 (26-44). Four had previous history of endometriosis or severe dysmenorrhea. One patient complained of chronic shoulder pain with diaphragmatic implants, another one presented catamenial hemoptysis, and three women suffered from catamenial pneumothorax, with right-side preference.Three patients underwent surgery and all of them were treated with GnRH agonists at least during 6 month referring improvement in symptoms. After 1-8 years follow-up, all these patients remain asymptomatic.The optimal management of thoracic endometriosis needs further evaluation but the combined approach by hormonal therapy and surgery could be the best option.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809986","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.688124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Dysmenorrhea","weight":0.644715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmenorrhea"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.478552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.469957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.376462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hemothorax","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemothorax"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.240999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Shoulder problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_problem"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
