{"id":67494,"title":"Serum levels of fibroblast growth factor-21 are increased in chronic and acute renal dysfunction.","abstract":"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 has recently been introduced as a circulating adipokine which reverses insulin resistance and obesity in rodents. In this study, regulation of FGF-21 in renal dysfunction was elucidated in both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney dysfunction (AKD).Serum concentrations of total FGF-21 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 499 patients with CKD stages 1-5 (study population 1). Furthermore, total FGF-21 was determined before and within 30 h after unilateral nephrectomy, a model of AKD, in 32 patients (study population 2). FGF-21 levels were correlated to anthropometric and biochemical parameters of renal function, glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation, in both studies.In study population 1, median [interquartile range] circulating FGF-21 adjusted for age, gender and body mass index was significantly different between CKD stages with highest values detectable in stage 5 (stage 1: 86·4 [132·9]; 2: 206·4 [223·1]; 3: 289·8 [409·3]; 4: 591·3 [789·0]; 5: 1918·1 [4157·0] ng/l). Furthermore, estimated glomerular filtration rate remained a strong independent and negative predictor of FGF-21. In study population 2, FGF-21 increased significantly postsurgically (325·0 [984·0] ng/l) as compared to presurgical values (255·5 [243·0] ng/l). Furthermore, relative changes of FGF-21 were independently and positively predicted by relative changes of creatinine.We demonstrate that circulating FGF-21 is increased in both CKD and AKD. Our results suggest renal excretion as a major route for FGF-21 elimination. The pathophysiological significance of these findings needs to be elucidated in more detail.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612017","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.869868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.758188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.676137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.669984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.561592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.484431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.302517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"}]}
