{"id":15166,"title":"High colonization rates of extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in Swiss travellers to South Asia- a prospective observational multicentre cohort study looking at epidemiology, microbiology and risk factors.","abstract":"International travel contributes to the worldwide spread of multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Rates of travel-related faecal colonization with extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae vary for different destinations. Especially travellers returning from the Indian subcontinent show high colonization rates. So far, nothing is known about region-specific risk factors for becoming colonized.An observational prospective multicentre cohort study investigated travellers to South Asia. Before and after travelling, rectal swabs were screened for third-generation cephalosporin- and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Participants completed questionnaires to identify risk factors for becoming colonized. Covariates were assessed univariately, followed by a multivariate regression.Hundred and seventy persons were enrolled, the largest data set on travellers to the Indian subcontinent so far. The acquired colonization rate with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli overall was 69.4% (95% CI 62.1-75.9%), being highest in travellers returning from India (86.8%; 95% CI 78.5-95.0%) and lowest in travellers returning from Sri Lanka (34.7%; 95% CI 22.9-48.7%). Associated risk factors were travel destination, length of stay, visiting friends and relatives, and eating ice cream and pastry.High colonization rates with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were found in travellers returning from South Asia. Though risk factors were identified, a more common source, i.e. environmental, appears to better explain the high colonization rates.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270732","annotations":[{"name":"Sri Lanka","weight":0.811368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"India","weight":0.746694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.710292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent","weight":0.689939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.558091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.556969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.547422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.499973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.351026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Ice cream","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Pastry","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.11105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Colonialism","weight":0.0574572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism"},{"name":"Ice","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Sri","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Tourist destination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist_destination"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0141339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"}]}
