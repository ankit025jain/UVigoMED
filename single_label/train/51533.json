{"id":51533,"title":"Mir-23b and miR-130b expression is downregulated in pituitary adenomas.","abstract":"MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. miR-23b and miR-130b are induced by thyrotropin in thyroid cells in a cAMP-dependent manner. The aim of our work has been to investigate the possible role of miR-23b and miR-130b in pituitary tumorigenesis. We have analyzed their expression in a panel of pituitary adenomas (PAs) including GH and NFPA adenomas. We report that miR-23b and miR-130b are drastically reduced in GH, gonadotroph and NFPA adenomas in comparison with normal pituitary gland. Interestingly, the overexpression of miR-23b and miR-130b inhibits cell proliferation arresting the cells in the G1 and G2 phase of the cell cycle, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-23b and miR-130b target HMGA2 and cyclin A2 (CCNA2) genes, respectively. Finally, downregulation of miR-23b and miR-130b expression is associated with increased levels of their respective targets in human PAs. These findings suggest that miR-23b and miR-130b downregulation may contribute to pituitary tumorigenesis.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681352","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.908778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.905122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.763007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"G2 phase","weight":0.534631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G2_phase"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.381229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.365779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.144683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.121805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Cyclin A","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_A"},{"name":"CCNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNA"},{"name":"HMGA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGA"},{"name":"HMGA2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGA2"},{"name":"Cyclin A2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_A2"},{"name":"Deregulation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Physician assistant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_assistant"},{"name":"Mir","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir"},{"name":"National Fire Protection Association","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fire_Protection_Association"}]}
