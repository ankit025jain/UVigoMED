{"id":88343,"title":"Unusual radial nerve injury by a locking compression plate for humerus fracture.","abstract":"The management of primary and secondary radial nerve palsy associated with humeral shaft fractures is still controversial. Radial nerve function is likely to return spontaneously after primary as well as secondary radial nerve palsy in the absence of any level of neurotmesis. Identification and protection of the radial nerve during surgery may prevent secondary nerve palsy, but is not always performed and depends on the location of the fracture, and the experience and preference of the surgeon. We report a case of a healthy 40-year-old woman, referred to our hospital with a complete radial nerve palsy and a failed plate fixation of a right humeral shaft fracture. During exploration of the radial nerve and surgical revision of the fracture, we found the nerve entrapped by the plate and partially transected by a screw. Full recovery of radial nerve function occurred after neurolysis and microscopic neurorrhaphy.
