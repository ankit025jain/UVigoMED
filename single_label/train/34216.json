{"id":34216,"title":"Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in children following the Ross procedure.","abstract":"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) frequently accompanies the progression of aortic valve disease in children. The extent of LVH regression following surgical relief of aortic valve disease in children has not been clearly elucidated. We hypothesized that significant regression of LVH will occur in children following the Ross procedure.We examined LVH over time in children <18 years of age who underwent the Ross procedure. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and corresponding z scores were calculated based on height, age and gender. Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined as an LVMI of > 39 g/m(2.7) and a z score of >1.6.Twenty-five children underwent the Ross procedure. The left ventricular mass increased proportionally with the growth of the child from baseline to the latest follow-up at 7.3 ± 2.9 years (121.1 ± 81.5 vs 133.1 ± 79.8 g, P = 0.4). However, 96% (24/25) of children demonstrated LVMI regression from baseline. Mean LVMI decreased from 70.8 ± 31.2 to 41.8 ± 16.6 g/m(2.7) (P < 0.001). Similarly, LVMI z scores decreased from 2.2 ± 1.2 to 0.2 ± 1.9 (P < 0.001). Freedom from LVH was 83% at 10 years. Examination of LVMI and z scores over time demonstrated that the largest decrease occurred after the first year, with continued gradual decline over 10 years of follow-up.The Ross procedure is effective in reversing LVH in children with aortic valve disease.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756843","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.612649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Left ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.316451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.176249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Ross procedure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_procedure"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Left-wing politics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Z","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.0156704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"}]}
