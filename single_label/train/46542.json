{"id":46542,"title":"Helicobacter pylori modulates cisplatin sensitivity in gastric cancer by down-regulating miR-141 expression.","abstract":"Recent studies found that gastric cancer patients with Helicobacter pylori infection had a better response to chemotherapy and had an improved overall prognosis compared with those without. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown.Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to determine the expression profile of miR-141 in H. pylori infected cells and tissues and their respective controls. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to determine the expression level of KEAP-1. Luciferase reporter assays were used to determine whether KEAP-1 was a direct target of miR-141 in the gastric cancer cells. MTT and apoptosis assay were performed to detect the survival of cells under cisplatin treatment.We found that H. pylori infection can significantly down-regulate miR-141 expression. Knockdown miR-141 expression in 7901/DDP and 7901 cells could significantly improve cisplatin sensitivity. Over-expression of miR-141 resulted in enhanced resistance to cisplatin in both gastric cancer cells. We also demonstrated that miR-141 directly targets KEAP1 by luciferase reporter assay, and that down-regulation of KEAP1 induces cisplatin resistance. Conversely, over-expression of KEAP1 significantly enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Our 75 pairs of tissues also showed that KEAP1 was significantly up-regulated in H. pylori-positive tissues.Altogether, these findings demonstrated that the H. pylori infection could modulate cisplatin sensitivity through miR-141-mediated regulation of KEAP1.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628843","annotations":[{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.907678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.88969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.717082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.630688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.600491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.358737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.302703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.274731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.262303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.114399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.0369874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
