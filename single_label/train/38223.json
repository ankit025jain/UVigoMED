{"id":38223,"title":"Cardiac dysfunction is associated with altered sarcomere ultrastructure in intrauterine growth restriction.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to assess whether abnormal cardiac function in human fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with ultrastructural differences in the cardiomyocyte sarcomere.Nine severe early-onset IUGR fetuses and 9 normally grown fetuses (appropriate growth for gestational age) who died in the perinatal period were included prospectively. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and levels of B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin-I. Heart sections were imaged by second harmonic generation microscopy, which allowed unstained visualization of cardiomyocyte's sarcomere length.Echocardiographic and biochemical markers showed signs of severe cardiac dysfunction in IUGR fetuses. Second harmonic generation microscopy demonstrated a significantly shorter sarcomere length in IUGR as compared with appropriate growth for gestational age fetuses.IUGR is associated with changes in the cardiomyocyte contractile machinery in the form of shorter sarcomere length, which could help to explain the cardiac dysfunction previously documented inÂ IUGR.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440565","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Sarcomere","weight":0.7371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcomere"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.570497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Intrauterine growth restriction","weight":0.255374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.209153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Biomarker (medicine)","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker_(medicine)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
