{"id":37129,"title":"Successful haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with SCID due to CD3? deficiency: need for IgG-substitution 6 years later.","abstract":"The CD3 co-receptor complex is essential for signal transduction after specific binding of the T-cell receptor (TCR). CD3E encodes the CD3? chain, one of the protein components (?-, ?-, ?- and ?-chain) of the CD3 co-receptor. As previously reported in one family CD3? deficiency causes SCID.We report on a patient with SCID due to CD3? deficiency treated by HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation (SCT) (donor: mother) 15 years ago which resulted in development of normal T- and B-cell immunity. Despite conditioning donor cell engraftment was confined to T cells, while all other blood cell lineages remained of patient origin (split chimerism). In spite of normal functions, T-cell numbers never reached normal levels and na√Øve CD45+RA+ T-cells remained low. At 6 years after SCT the patient developed signs of humoral immunodeficiency, requiring regular substitution of IgG.In a retrospective genetic work up 11 years after SCT, a homozygous splice site mutation in CD3E was identified resulting in the loss of CD3? protein. The loss of B-cell function as observed in the patient was reflected by a lack of switched memory B cells. To rule out a primary role of CD3? in B-cell function we studied expression of CD3E in B-cells which was found not to be expressed.The clinical presentation of a secondary loss of specific humoral immunity in this constellation of split chimerism after allogeneic haploidentical SCT is unusual and unexpected in a patient with a primary T-cell defect. A most likely explanation is the gradual loss of T-helper-cell function.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
