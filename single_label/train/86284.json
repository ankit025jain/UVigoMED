{"id":86284,"title":"Guillain-Barre syndrome after lung lobectomy: is there any relationship?","abstract":"Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory polyradiculopathy frequently triggered by infection. It has also been reported in some cases after surgical procedures. We describe the first case of GBS occurring 9 days after lung lobectomy for localized lung cancer and efficiently treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. The exact physiopathology of GBS after surgical procedures is unknown. An immune-mediated process and perioperative infection are the most accepted etiologic hypotheses.
