{"id":68261,"title":"Female clitoral priapism: an over-the-counter option for management.","abstract":"Female priapism is a rare condition that is not commonly described in the literature. There are many treatment strategies for the management of priapism, including conservative and safe over-the-counter options.To describe a case of a woman who presented with clitoral priapism, who was managed conservatively with a simple over-the-counter treatment plan.A 29-year-old gravida 0 para 0 presented to the emergency room with painful clitoral priapism lasting for 5 days. Despite cessation of the suspected causal agents, trazodone and wellbutrin, her symptoms persisted.The patient was managed conservatively with analgesics and around-the-clock oral pseudoephedrine and experienced complete resolution of her symptoms.Oral pseudoephedrine may be a reasonable option for certain patients, and may be considered as a first-line therapy and adjunct to conservative measures.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533470","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.512277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.494356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.483133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.445831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Priapism","weight":0.405556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priapism"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Pseudoephedrine","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine"},{"name":"Trazodone","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trazodone"},{"name":"Clitoris","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Glossary of terms associated with gravidity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_terms_associated_with_gravidity"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Reference counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Para (currency)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para_(currency)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"},{"name":"Focke-Wulf A 17","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_A_17"}]}
