{"id":29386,"title":"[On the history of opium].","abstract":"Most likely, opium was the first narcotic substance discovered at the dawn of humankind. The history of drug addiction is immensely rich and allows for tracing the long way humankind had to travel to reach the contemporary level of consciousness with respect to narcotic substances. A retrospective view of drug addiction that takes into consideration the historical context, while extending our knowledge, also allows for a better understanding of today's problems. The report presents elements of a retrospective view of problems associated with addiction to opium, morphine and heroin over the centuries, what is a subject of scientific interest in contemporary toxicology.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672899","annotations":[{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Opium","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Narcotic","weight":0.710976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.499695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"History","weight":0.37754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Altered level of consciousness","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_level_of_consciousness"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"}]}
