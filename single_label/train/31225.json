{"id":31225,"title":"Pathogenesis and preventive treatment for animal disease due to locoweed poisoning.","abstract":"Locoweeds are perennial herbaceous plants included in Astragalus spp. and Oxytropis spp. that contain the toxic indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine. The livestock that consume locoweed feeding can suffer from a type of toxicity called \"locoism.\" There are aliphatic nitro compounds, selenium, selenium compounds and alkaloids in locoweed. The toxic component in locoweeds has been identified as swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid. Swainsonine inhibits lysosomal ?-mannosidase and mannosidase II, resulting in altered oligosaccharide degradation and incomplete glycoprotein processing. As a result, livestock that consume locoweeds exhibit several symptoms, including dispirited behavior, staggering gait, chromatopsia, trembling, ataxia, and cellular vacuolar degeneration of most tissues by pathological observation. Locoism results in significant annual economic losses. Recently, locoweed populations have increased domestically in China and abroad, resulting in an increase in the incidence of poisoning. Therefore, in this paper, we review the current research on locoweed, including on species variation, pathogenesis, damage and poisoning prevention measures.
