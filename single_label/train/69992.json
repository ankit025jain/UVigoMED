{"id":69992,"title":"Phase I dose escalation and pharmacokinetic study of oral gefitinib and irinotecan in children with refractory solid tumors.","abstract":"This phase I study endeavored to estimate the maximum tolerated dose and describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral irinotecan with gefitinib in children with refractory solid tumors.Oral irinotecan was administered on days 1-5 and 8-12 with oral gefitinib (fixed dose, 150 mg/m(2)/day) on days 1-12 of a 21-day course. The escalation with overdose control method guided irinotecan dose escalation (7 dose levels, range 5-40 mg/m(2)/day).Sixteen of 19 patients were evaluable, with serial pharmacokinetic studies in ten patients. Diagnoses included osteosarcoma (N = 5), neuroblastoma (N = 3), sarcoma (N = 3), and others (N = 5). Patients received a median of two courses (range 1-20), with at least two patients treated on dose levels 2-7. Three patients had five DLTs; the most common being metabolic (hypokalemia, N = 2 and hypophosphatemia, N = 1) at dose levels two (10 mg/m(2)) and four (20 mg/m(2)). One patient experienced grade 3 diarrhea (40 mg/m(2)). Irinotecan bioavailability was 2.5-fold higher when co-administered with gefitinib, while the conversion rate of irinotecan to SN-38 lactone was unaffected. The study closed due to poor accrual before evaluation of the next recommended irinotecan dose level (35 mg/m(2)). Of 11 patients receiving at least two courses of therapy, three had stable disease lasting two to four courses and one patient maintained a complete response through 18 courses.The combination of oral gefitinib and irinotecan has acceptable toxicity and anti-tumor activity in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic analysis confirms that co-administration of gefitinib increases irinotecan bioavailability leading to an increased SN-38 lactone systemic exposure.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25257509","annotations":[{"name":"Gefitinib","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefitinib"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Hypokalemia","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemia"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.679206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.549876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Lactone","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactone"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.24672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.197423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0623612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Hypophosphatemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypophosphatemia"},{"name":"Maximum tolerated dose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_tolerated_dose"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"}]}
