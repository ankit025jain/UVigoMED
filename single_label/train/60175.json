{"id":60175,"title":"Erdheim-Chester disease: a comprehensive review.","abstract":"Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare form of non-Langerhans' cell histiocytosis characterized by multi-system infiltration by xanthogranulomas composed of foamy histiocytes surrounded by fibrosis. Approximately 400 cases have been reported in the literature, and the recent increase in the number of cases is likely due to the increased awareness of its associated morbidity and mortality. The etiology of this disease remains unknown, the clinical course is variable and treatment is still not well-established. The objective of this review is to describe the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this rare disorder, and to review its prognosis and treatment. Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare form of non-Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. It was first described in 1930. Approximately 400 cases have been reported in the literature.
