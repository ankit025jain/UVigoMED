{"id":90934,"title":"Lactate and the injured brain: friend or foe?","abstract":"Energy metabolism is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of acute brain injury (ABI). We review the role of cerebral lactate metabolism and summarize evidence showing that lactate may act as supplemental fuel after ABI.The role of cerebral lactate has shifted from a waste product to a potentially preferential fuel and signaling molecule. According to the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle model, glycolytic lactate might act as glucose-sparing substrate. Lactate also is emerging as a key signal to regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and a neuroprotective agent after experimental ABI. Clinical investigation using cerebral microdialysis shows the existence of two main lactate patterns, ischemic - from anaerobic metabolism - and nonischemic, from activated glycolysis, whereby lactate can be used as supplemental energy fuel. Preliminary clinical data suggests hypertonic lactate solutions improve cerebral energy metabolism and are an effective treatment for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) after ABI.Lactate can be a supplemental fuel for the injured brain and is important to regulate glucose metabolism and CBF. Exogenous lactate supplementation may be neuroprotective after experimental ABI. Recent clinical data from ABI patients suggest hypertonic lactate solutions may be a valid therapeutic option for secondary energy dysfunction and elevated ICP.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561705","annotations":[{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Fermentation (biochemistry)","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.799718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.789222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.71083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.692836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.637545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Signaling molecule","weight":0.597618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_molecule"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.592486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.571019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cerebral blood flow","weight":0.483661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_blood_flow"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.44581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.32596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Microdialysis","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdialysis"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Fuel","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"},{"name":"Bioenergetics","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0158637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"}]}
