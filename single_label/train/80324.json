{"id":80324,"title":"Sporozoite immunization of human volunteers under chemoprophylaxis induces functional antibodies against pre-erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum.","abstract":"Long-lasting and sterile protective immunity against Plasmodium falciparum can be achieved by immunization of malaria-naive human volunteers under chloroquine prophylaxis with sporozoites delivered by mosquito bites (CPS-immunization). Protection is mediated by sporozoite/liver-stage immunity. In this study, the capacity of CPS-induced antibodies to interfere with sporozoite functionality and development was explored.IgG was purified from plasma samples obtained before and after CPS-immunization from two separate clinical trials. The functionality of these antibodies was assessed in vitro in gliding and human hepatocyte traversal assays, and in vivo in a human liver-chimeric mouse model.Whereas pre-treatment of sporozoites with 2 mg/ml IgG in the majority of the volunteers did not have an effect on in vitro sporozoite gliding motility, CPS-induced IgG showed a distinct inhibitory effect in the sporozoite in vitro traversal assay. Pre-treatment of P. falciparum sporozoites with post-immunization IgG significantly inhibited sporozoite traversal through hepatocytes in 9/9 samples when using 10 and 1 mg/ml IgG, and was dose-dependent, resulting in an average 16% and 37% reduction with 1 mg/ml IgG (p = 0.003) and 10 mg/ml IgG (p = 0.002), respectively. In vivo, CPS-induced IgG reduced liver-stage infection and/or development after a mosquito infection in the human liver-chimeric mouse model by 91.05% when comparing 11 mice receiving post-immunization IgG to 11 mice receiving pre-immunization IgG (p = 0.0008).It is demonstrated for the first time that CPS-immunization induces functional antibodies against P. falciparum sporozoites, which are able to reduce parasite-host cell interaction by inhibiting parasite traversal and liver-stage infection. These data highlight the functional contribution of antibody responses to pre-erythrocytic immunity after whole-parasite immunization against P. falciparum malaria.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708526","annotations":[{"name":"Chloroquine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.846737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.805571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Chemoprophylaxis","weight":0.805518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoprophylaxis"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.805162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.617548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.598638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.515544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.45632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.333835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.330817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.114781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Venom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
