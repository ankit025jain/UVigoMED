{"id":59467,"title":"NUCKS1 overexpression is a novel biomarker for recurrence-free survival in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Nuclear casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1 (NUCKS1) is overexpressed in various cancer tissues and may therefore contribute to oncogenesis. However, the status of NUCKS1 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) remains unknown. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of NUCKS1 protein in 30 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CINs) and 125 CSCCs compared with 20 normal cervical specimens. The correlationships of NUCKS1 protein overexpression with the clinicopathologic characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients with CSCC were analysed. The status of NUCKS1 expression was negative or weak in normal tissues, but high in 21 (70.0 %) CINs and in 44 (35.2 %) CSCCs. NUCKS1 overexpression was associated with advanced International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stage (P?=?0.016), poor histologic grade (P?=?0.040), large tumour size (P?=?0.016), parametrial involvement (P?=?0.025), deep stromal infiltration (P?=?0.043), lymph node metastasis (P?=?0.034) and recurrence (P?<?0.001). Multivariate analysis suggested that NUCKS1 overexpression was an independent factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) (hazard ratio, 2.193; 95 % confidence interval, 1.060 to 4.535; P?=?0.034). In conclusion, NUCKS1 overexpression may be associated with tumour progression and recurrence in CSCCs and may thus serve as a new molecular marker for the prediction of RFS in these patients.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819170","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.868176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.6732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.507807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.439516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.398697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.371616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.295642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.29127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Obstetrics and gynaecology","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Casein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Molecular marker","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_marker"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
