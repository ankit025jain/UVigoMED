{"id":35656,"title":"Modeling inherited cardiac disorders.","abstract":"Advances in the understanding and treatment of cardiac disorders have been thwarted by the inability to study beating human cardiac cells in vitro. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) bypass this hurdle by enabling the creation of patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). These cells provide a unique platform to study cardiac diseases in vitro, especially hereditary cardiac conditions. To date, iPSC-CMs have been used to successfully model arrhythmic disorders, showing excellent recapitulation of cardiac channel function and electrophysiologic features of long QT syndrome types 1, 2, 3, and 8, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Similarly, iPSC-CM models of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have shown robust correlation of predicted morphologic, contractile, and electrical phenotypes. In addition, iPSC-CMs have shown some features of the respective phenotypes for arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C), LEOPARD syndrome, Pompe's disease, and Friedriech's ataxia. In this review, we examine the progress of utilizing iPSC-CMs as a model for cardiac conditions and analyze the potential for the platform in furthering the biology and treatment of cardiac disorders.??","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632794","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.864532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Ventricular tachycardia","weight":0.843834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.806779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.771928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.606847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.584455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.413243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.323266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia","weight":0.134746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholaminergic_polymorphic_ventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.116707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pluripotent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotent"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
