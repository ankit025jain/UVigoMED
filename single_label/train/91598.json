{"id":91598,"title":"[Effect of a mineral organic complex on mice radioresistance].","abstract":"Experiments showed that drinking water supplemented with a complex of 12 microelements and organic acids stimulates body mass gain and strengthening of radioresistance in mice. Obviously, availability of water with the mineral and organic complex before and after irradiation was the factor in survival of a part of mice exposed to the absolutely lethal dose (7.6 Gy from gamma-quanta 60Co) and reduction of chromosomal aberrations rate in bone marrow cells in consequence of nonlethal (1 Gy) irradiation.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490285","annotations":[{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.868176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.453812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.376952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.361745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.343592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Radioresistance","weight":0.244307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioresistance"},{"name":"Organic acid","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_acid"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.163159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Lethal dose","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_dose"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0471213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
