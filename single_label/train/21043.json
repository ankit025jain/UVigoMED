{"id":21043,"title":"Single-center retrospective study of the incidence of, and risk factors for, non-C. albicans invasive candidiasis in hospitalized patients in China.","abstract":"The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of invasive candidiasis (IC) in a Beijing hospital, to identify risk factors associated with IC caused by non-C. albicans Candida (NAC), and to determine risk factors for infection caused by NAC species not susceptible to fluconazole. Clinical data from 141 patients admitted to Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (from 2001-2010) diagnosed with IC were retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of IC increased during the 10-year period, but the proportion due to NAC did not change significantly in that of 141 cases, 55 (39%) were due to NAC and 86 (61%) to C. albicans (CA). The NAC species isolated included C. tropicalis (25 of 141, 18%), C. glabrata (14 of 141, 9.9%), C. parapsilosis (eight of 141, 5.7%), C. krusei (three of 141, 2.1%) and C. lusitaniae (one of 141, 0.71%); other Candida species accounted for four of the 141 cases (2.8%). Twenty-one isolates (38%) of NAC were not susceptible to fluconazole. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.5-58; P < 0.001) and previous fluconazole therapy (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-27; P = 0.001) were risk factors for invasive NAC candidiasis, whereas patient age ?65 years (OR 0.37; CI 0.16-0.88; P = 0.025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.22; CI 0.069-0.70; P =0.010) were connected with invasive CA candidiasis. Prior fluconazole therapy was a risk factor (P = 0.007) for infections caused by NAC not susceptible to fluconazole. In conclusion, TPN and prior fluconazole therapy are independent risk factors for NAC infection, while prior fluconazole therapy is a risk factor for infection due to NAC not susceptible to fluconazole.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626056","annotations":[{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.878133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.707959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.384217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.266355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.230354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.194746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.0627764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Chaoyang, Liaoning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaoyang,_Liaoning"},{"name":"Oregon Route 7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_7"},{"name":"Candida krusei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_krusei"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"558","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/558"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"NAC Breda","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAC_Breda"},{"name":"227 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/227_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Candida tropicalis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
