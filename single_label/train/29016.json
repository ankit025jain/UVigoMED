{"id":29016,"title":"[Aging and alcohol consumption].","abstract":"The risks associated with the consumption of alcohol are higher in old age. These risks are somatic, psychological or related to addiction and negative interactions between alcohol and medication. The misuse of alcohol does not disappear with age, but it takes different forms, sometimes atypical, depending on the co-morbidities, the circumstances and the living or care environment. Treatment is always possible, even in elderly people, with certain specificities, but also with a prognosis which is as good as if not better than in younger adults.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745118","annotations":[{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.661902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.497689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.457728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.44149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Islamic dietary laws","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_dietary_laws"}]}
