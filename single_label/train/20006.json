{"id":20006,"title":"[Treatment of pubic osteomyelitis secondary to pressure sores].","abstract":"There is no consensus regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for pubic osteomyelitis secondary to pelvic pressure sores. Diagnosis is often difficult and bone biopsies with microbiological and anatomical-pathological examination remain the gold standard. The rate of cicatrisation of pressure sores is low. Cleansing and negative pressure treatment are key elements of the treatment. Optimising the care management with medical-surgical collaboration is being studied in the Ostear protocol.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683861","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.497263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.369388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.123606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Pubis (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"},{"name":"Cleansing (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_(album)"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Chronic care management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_care_management"}]}
