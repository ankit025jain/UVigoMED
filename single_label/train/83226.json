{"id":83226,"title":"Influence of cone beam CT enhancement filters on diagnosis ability of longitudinal root fractures.","abstract":"To determine whether cone beam CT (CBCT) enhancement filters influence the diagnosis of longitudinal root fractures.40 extracted human posterior teeth were endodontically prepared, and fractures with no separation of fragments were made in 20 teeth of this sample. The teeth were placed in a dry mandible and scanned using a Classic i-CAT® CBCT device (Imaging Sciences International, Inc., Hatfield, PA). Evaluations were performed with and without CBCT filters (Sharpen Mild, Sharpen Super Mild, S9, Sharpen, Sharpen 3?×?3, Angio Sharpen Medium 5?×?5, Angio Sharpen High 5?×?5 and Shadow 3?×?3) by three oral radiologists. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was calculated by the kappa test. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were determined. McNemar test was applied for agreement between all images vs the gold standard and original images vs images with filters (p?<?0.05).Means of intraobserver agreement ranged from good to excellent. Angio Sharpen Medium 5?×?5 filter obtained the highest positive predictive value (80.0%) and specificity value (76.5%). Angio Sharpen High 5?×?5 filter obtained the highest sensitivity (78.9%) and accuracy (77.5%) value. Negative predictive value was the highest (82.9%) for S9 filter. The McNemar test showed no statistically significant differences between images with and without CBCT filters (p?>?0.05).Although no statistical differences was observed in the diagnosis of root fractures when using filters, these filters seem to improve diagnostic capacity for longitudinal root fractures. Further in vitro studies with endodontic-treated teeth and research in vivo should be considered.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24408819","annotations":[{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.724194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.57086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.440019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.265635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0627294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Hatfield, Pennsylvania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield,_Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Index of coincidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_coincidence"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"CBCT (TV)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBCT_(TV)"},{"name":"McNemar's test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNemar's_test"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Hatfield, Hertfordshire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield,_Hertfordshire"},{"name":"F.C.
