{"id":2788,"title":"Comparative evaluation of higher-order aberrations and corneal asphericity between wavefront-guided and aspheric LASIK for myopia.","abstract":"To compare visual outcome, higher-order aberrations, and corneal asphericity (Q value) between wavefront-guided and aspheric LASIK for myopia and myopic astigmatism.Forty patients were randomly selected to receive wavefront-guided LASIK (wavefront-guided group) or aspheric LASIK (aspheric group) (40 eyes of 20 patients in each group) using the Technolas 217z excimer laser platform (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY). Flaps were created using the Zyoptix XP microkeratome (Bausch & Lomb). Preoperative and postoperative evaluation included uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corneal topography, wavefront aberrometry, and contrast sensitivity. Minimum follow-up period was 6 months.At 6 months postoperatively, the aspheric group had significantly better UDVA (logMAR 0.04 ± 0.04 [Snellen 20/16] [range: -0.079 to 0.000]) and lower mean residual spherical error (+0.10 ± 0.52 diopters [D] [range: -1.12 to 1.25 D]) than the wavefront-guided group (logMAR UDVA 0.00 ± 0.07 [range: -0.079 to 0.176]; MRSE -0.35 ± 0.47 D [range: -1.5 to 0.62 D]) (P = .003 and < .001, respectively). Mean change in higher-order aberration root mean square at 6 months postoperatively (6-mm pupil) was 0.16 ± 0.17 µm after aspheric LASIK and 0.27 ± 0.28 µm after wavefront-guided LASIK (P = .02). Aspheric LASIK induced minimal change in spherical aberrations postoperatively (0.03 ± 0.12 µm, P = .09), unlike wavefront-guided LASIK (0.23 ± 0.17 µm, P < .01). Change in Q value was significantly less in the aspheric group (0.53 ± 0.31) than the wavefront-guided group (0.91 ± 0.30) (P < .01). The aspheric group had significant improvement in contrast sensitivity at all spatial frequencies (P < .01), whereas the wavefront-guided group showed a slight decrease at higher spatial frequency (18 cycles per degree).Aspheric LASIK induced significantly less change in higher-order aberrations and maintained corneal asphericity better than wavefront-guided LASIK. The visual outcome and contrast sensitivity was better in the aspheric group at 6 months postoperatively.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375851","annotations":[{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.901907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Microkeratome","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkeratome"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.725294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.69428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Spherical aberration","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.607639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Spatial frequency","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_frequency"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Aspheric lens","weight":0.204537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspheric_lens"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Corneal topography","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_topography"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Root mean square","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Rochester, New York","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Film speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Q factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor"},{"name":"Square (algebra)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(algebra)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Redshift","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift"}]}
