{"id":83518,"title":"Simulation of a single red blood cell flowing through a microvessel stenosis using dissipative particle dynamics.","abstract":"The motion and deformation of a single red blood cell flowing through a microvessel stenosis was investigated employing dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. The numerical model considers plasma, cytoplasm, the RBC membrane and the microvessel walls, in which a three dimensional coarse-grained spring RBC. The suspending plasma was modelled as an incompressible Newtonian fluid and the vessel walls were regarded as rigid body. The body force exerted on the free DPD particles was used to drive the flow. A modified bounce-back boundary condition was enforced on the membrane to guarantee the impenetrability. Adhesion of the cell to the stenosis vessel surface was mediated by the interactions between receptors and ligands. Firstly, the motion of a single RBC in a microfluidic channel was simulated and the results were found in agreement with the experimental data cited by [1]. Then the mechanical behavior of the RBC in the microvessel stenosis was studied. The effects of the bending rigidity of membrane, the size of the stenosis and the driven body force on the deformation and motion of red blood cell were discussed.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330624","annotations":[{"name":"Isaac
