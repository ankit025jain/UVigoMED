{"id":374,"title":"Distribution of classical enterotoxin genes in staphylococci from milk of cows with- and without mastitis and the cowshed environment.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to analyze by PCR 185 isolates of Staphylococcus from milk of cows with- and without mastitis and from the cowsheds environment for their potential ability to produce five classical staphylococcal enterotoxins. Among S. aureus isolates 8 (32%) carried enterotoxin genes and only 2 of them had more than one gene. The enterotoxin genes were detected in 22 (13.7%) coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolates, among them in 9 (11.4%) isolates of S. xylosus, 5 (16.7%) S. sciuri, 3 (10.3%) S. epidermidis and in 5 (22.7%) Staphylococcus spp. In some CNS 2 or 3 genes were detected simultaneously. Among the investigated enterotoxin genes, sec was the most prevalent (70%). The genes encoding enterotoxin B and D were detected in 5 (16.7%) and 6 (20%) isolates, respectively. The lowest number of isolates had sea and see genes. The genes encoding enterotoxins were often identified in staphylococci from milk of cows with mastitis (73.4% of detected genes), while only 6 (20%) isolates from milk of cows without mastitis and 2 (6.6%) isolates from cowshed environment were positive for enterotoxin genes. The results showed that CNS from bovine milk, like S. aureus, carried enterotoxin genes and may pose a risk for public health.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286646","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.852729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.67991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.58362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.39111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Mastitis","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Factory farming","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming"},{"name":"Staphylococcus epidermidis","weight":0.136645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_epidermidis"},{"name":"Sea","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Enterotoxin","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxin"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Shed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shed"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"}]}
