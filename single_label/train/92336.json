{"id":92336,"title":"Influence of model and matrix on cytokine profile in rat and human.","abstract":"Emerging evidence indicates that low-grade inflammation is part of the clinical picture of OA and that there is a need to identify soluble biomarkers of ongoing inflammation in the joint from a translational aspect. The aim of this study was to compare levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers in SF, serum and/or EDTA plasma.SF and blood from rats subjected to Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA; n = 48) or monoiodoacetate (MIA; n = 88) monoarthritis and from control rats were collected over time. SF, EDTA plasma and serum were obtained from six individuals with OA of the knee and healthy controls. Levels of IL-6, KC/GRO, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 3? (MIP-3?), IL-1?, TNF and l(+)-lactate were assessed either by immune assay or by a colorimetric method.Elevated levels of biomarkers were shown in monoarthritic animals in SF compared with the control groups, although with considerably lower magnitude in the MIA groups, which also indicated a biphasic pattern. Levels of KC/GRO and MIP-3? in serum from the FCA model and IL-6 in the MIA model followed the pattern of SF. In serum samples from OA individuals, MIP-3? correlated significantly with levels in SF.While we found increased levels of markers in joint fluid and blood, no single systemic biochemical biomarkers that were a common denominator between the animal models and the patient material could be identified. Our data indicate that it is critical to delineate the temporal profile of multiple local and systemic factors in order to pinpoint soluble biomarkers for OA.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Musculoskeletal
