{"id":63674,"title":"Imbalanced expression of human Tim-1 and Tim-3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from immune thrombocytopenia patients.","abstract":"The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-(Tim)-1 molecule and Tim-3 are mainly expressed on activated T helper (Th) 2 and Th1 cells, respectively, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common autoimmune disorder, and the complex dysregulation of cellular immunity has been observed; however, the relationship between Tims and excessive immune responses in ITP remains unclear.Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the mRNA expression levels of Tim-1, Tim-3, T-box transcription factor (T-bet) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) were measured in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 45 newly diagnosed patients with active ITP, 34 ITP patients in remission and 31 healthy volunteers.Tim-3 mRNA expression in PBMCs in newly diagnosed patients was significantly decreased. At the same time, Tim-1 mRNA was not significantly declined, which resulted in a decreased ratio of Tim-3 to Tim-1 in ITP patients with active disease. During the remission stages, the levels of these transcription factors were comparable with those observed in healthy controls.The reduced levels of Tim-3/Tim-1 in PBMCs during active stages of the disease suggest a possible role in the pathogenesis and course of ITP. Regulating the balance of Tim-1 and Tim-3 in ITP patients could also be a therapeutic approach against ITP.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412470","annotations":[{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.749108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cell-mediated immunity","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell-mediated_immunity"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.712455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.604879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.435916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.417779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.208641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"GATA transcription factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATA_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
