{"id":22377,"title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa type-3 secretion system dampens host defense by exploiting the NLRC4-coupled inflammasome.","abstract":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major problem pathogen responsible for severe infections in critically ill patients, triggers, through a functional type-3 secretion system (T3SS), the activation of an intracellular cytosolic sensor of innate immunity, NLRC4. Although the NLRC4-inflammasome-dependent response contributes to increased clearance of intracellular pathogens, it seems that NLRC4 inflammasome activation decreases the clearance of P. aeruginosa, a mainly extracellular pathogen.We sought to determine the underlying mechanisms of this effect of the activation of NLRC4 by P. aeruginosa.We established acute lung injury in wild-type and Nlrc4(-/-) mice using sublethal intranasal inocula of P. aeruginosa strain CHA expressing or not a functional T3SS. We studied 96-hour survival, lung injury, bacterial clearance from the lungs, cytokine secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage, lung antimicrobial peptide expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry analysis of lung cells.Nlrc4(-/-) mice showed enhanced bacterial clearance and decreased lung injury contributing to increased survival against extracellular P. aeruginosa strain expressing a functional T3SS. The mechanism involved decreased NLRC4-inflammasome-driven IL-18 secretion attenuating lung injury caused by excessive neutrophil recruitment. Additionally, in the lungs of Nlrc4(-/-) mice secretion of IL-17 by innate immune cells was increased and responsible for increased expression of lung epithelial antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, IL-18 secretion was found to repress IL-17 and IL-17-driven lung antimicrobial peptide expression.We report a new role of the T3SS apparatus itself, independently of exotoxin translocation. Through NLRC4 inflammasome activation, the T3SS promotes IL-18 secretion, which dampens a beneficial IL-17-mediated antimicrobial host response.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections
