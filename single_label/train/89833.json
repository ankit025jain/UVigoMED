{"id":89833,"title":"Histomorphochemical comparison of microfracture as a first-line and a salvage procedure: is microfracture still a viable option for knee cartilage repair in a salvage situation?","abstract":"Microfracture is considered as the first-line procedure for knee cartilage repair, but the results of microfracture seem less predictable and rather controversial in a salvage situation. Thus, the purpose of the study was to histomorphochemically compare microfracture as a salvage procedure with microfracture as a first-line procedure in a rabbit model. We hypothesized that microfracture in a salvage situation would result in histomorphochemically inferior cartilage repair compared to microfracture as a first-line procedure, and the inferiority would be attributed to less migration of reparable marrow cells to the defect due to destruction of microarchitecture of the subchondral bone. Thirty-six New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups: (i) untreated full-thickness chondral defect, (ii) single microfracture treatment (first microfracture group), and (iii) repeated microfracture in 8 weeks after the first procedure (second microfracture group). In each group, rabbits were sacrificed at the end of 8 weeks, and osteochondral specimens at the repair sites were obtained for histomorphochemical analysis. Results showed that microfracture as a salvage procedure resulted in overall inferior cartilage repair histomorphochemically compared with microfracture as a first-line procedure, which correlated with deteriorative changes in the quality of underlying subchondral bone rather than intrinsic incapability to recruit the reparative cells in the defect area. In conclusion, although a comparable number of reparable cells and a mechanically weakened subchondral bone are anticipated, more study is necessary to clearly determine when a microfracture should be performed in a situation.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676881","annotations":[{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.551409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.446942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.435138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.224556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0845957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"New Zealand rabbit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_rabbit"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0193016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Inferiority complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferiority_complex"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Microfracture surgery","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfracture_surgery"},{"name":"Microarchitecture","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Human sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Angora rabbit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angora_rabbit"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Osteochondrosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
