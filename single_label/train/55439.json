{"id":55439,"title":"Identification of MYOC gene mutation and polymorphism in a large Malay family with juvenile-onset open angle glaucoma.","abstract":"To screen for mutations in the coding region of the myocilin (MYOC) gene in a large Malay family with juvenile-onset open angle glaucoma (JOAG).A total of 122 family members were thoroughly examined and screened for JOAG. Venipuncture was conducted. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. The presence of a mutation and a polymorphism was ascertained with PCR amplification followed by the direct sequencing technique.Thirty-two of the 122 screened family members were identified to have JOAG (11 new cases and 21 known cases). An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance was observed. A C?A substitution at position 1440 in exon 3 that changes asparagine (AAC) to lysine (AAA) was identified in affected family members except two probands (III:5 and IV:6). Six probands were identified as having the Asn480Lys mutation but have not developed the disease yet. An intronic polymorphism IVS2 730 +35 G>A was also identified. There was a significant association between Asn480Lys (p<0.001) and IVS2 730+35G>A (p<0.001) in the affected and unaffected probands in this family.The Asn480Lys mutation and the IVS2 730+35 G>A polymorphism increased susceptibility to JOAG in this large Malay pedigree. Identifying the MYOC mutations and polymorphisms is important for providing presymptomatic molecular diagnosis.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24883016","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.904698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Asparagine","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine"},{"name":"Penetrance","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.814798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.769674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.725048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.666133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Pedigree chart","weight":0.610968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.373667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.201978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.174482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"}]}
