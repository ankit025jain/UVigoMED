{"id":81179,"title":"Oral health of older people admitted to hospital for needs assessment.","abstract":"To describe the clinical oral health status, treatment needs and oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of older people admitted to older persons' wards at Dunedin Public Hospital due to a sudden worsening of their general health. Participants and methods: A systematic oral assessment was undertaken for a consecutive case series of 200 patients (59.5% female; mean age 82.6 years, sd 6.6) admitted to older person's wards at Dunedin Public Hospital. The Oral Health Impact Profile-20 (OHIP-20) was used to assess OHRQoL.One in three (36.0%) had been living independently at home prior to admission, and over half (55.0%) had been admitted for a medical reason which required assessment. Half (50.0%) of the participants were dentate (with an average of 16.8 teeth). There was an average of 1.9 decayed teeth present in the dentate group; 70.7% of individuals required restorations or extractions, and about 90% required only simple scaling of the teeth and prophylaxis. A reline or a replacement denture were required by three-quarters of those with dentures. Almost two-thirds of participants did not have a regular dentist, and fewer than one in three had made a dental visit in the previous year. One in six described their oral health as 'fair' or 'poor', and just under one-third reported dry mouth. Dentate participants, those without xerostomia, and those reporting better oral health had better OHRQoL, reflected in lower OHIP-20 scores. Affecting 37.1% of participants, functional limitation was the most commonly experienced of the OHIP-20 domains, followed by physical disability and physical pain (18.0% and 15.6% respectively).The oral health of medically compromised and functionally dependent but cognitively competent older people in this study is generally poor. If transfer to long-term care is indicated, early and proper preventive measures and appropriate dental contact should be advocated in order to reduce morbidity and improve quality of life for older people.","date":"2015-01-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25597193","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.773461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.770642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.694868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.694587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.624192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.498826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.385964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Physical disability","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0326281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Independent living","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_living"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
