{"id":81815,"title":"Improved outcomes after alloplastic TMJ replacement: analysis of a multicenter study from Australia and New Zealand.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to assess pain, function, diet, and quality of life (QOL) in subjects undergoing alloplastic temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reconstruction.A total of 72 subjects were sent a questionnaire an average of 4 years after undergoing either unilateral or bilateral total joint replacement with a custom TMJ Concepts or stock Biomet total joint replacement device. The changes in pain, function, diet, and quality of life were assessed.Of the 72 subjects, 52 returned the questionnaire. Pain, function, diet, and QOL were all significantly improved at a mean follow-up of 46.3 months. The complications reported included an altered facial sensation and facial weakness. No implant failures were reported.The placement of an alloplastic TMJ total joint replacement can provide benefits for patients in the areas of pain, function, diet, and QOL. Additional research is required in this area.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820776","annotations":[{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.682726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.344936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.247804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.244571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.110525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Biomet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomet"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Stock","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock"},{"name":"List of highest playoff series scoring averages in National Basketball Association history","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_playoff_series_scoring_averages_in_National_Basketball_Association_history"},{"name":"Facial weakness","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_weakness"}]}
