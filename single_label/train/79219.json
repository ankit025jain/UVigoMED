{"id":79219,"title":"Children with cochlear implants: cognitive skills, adaptive behaviors, social and emotional skills.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to examine cognitive skills, adaptive behavior, social and emotional skills in deaf children with cochlear implant (CI) compared to normal hearing children.The study included twenty children affected by profound hearing loss implanted with a CI compared to 20 healthy children matched to chronological age and gender.Results of this study indicated that 55% of children with CI showed a score in the normal range of nonverbal intelligence (IQ > 84), 40% in the borderline range (71 < IQ < 84) and 5% were in mild range(50 < IQ < 70). No significant differences were found after comparison with normal hearing children.Children with CI reported more abnormalities in emotional symptoms (p = .018) and peer problems(p = .037) than children with normal hearing. Age of CI was negatively correlated with IQ (p = .002),positively correlated with emotional symptoms (p = .04) and with peer problems (p = .02).CI has a positive effect on the lives of deaf children, especially if it is implanted in much earlier ages.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466572","annotations":[{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Intelligence quotient","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.625353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.603184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.556912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.508968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.343896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Nonverbal communication","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Profound hearing loss","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profound_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Chronology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"}]}
