{"id":50570,"title":"A large pedunculated leiomyoma with two-sided cystic degenerations mimicking a bilateral ovarian malignancy: a case report.","abstract":"The authors present an unusual case of a large, pedunculated uterine leiomyoma with two-sided cystic degenerations, which mimicked a bilateral malignant ovarian tumor on ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A 32-year-old unmarried female patient presented to our outpatient clinic with complaints of abdominal distention and a palpable abdominal mass extending into the upper abdomen. Ultrasonography and MRI revealed a large solid mass with bilateral cystic areas extending into both uterine adnexa. The patient then underwent a laparotomy. Gross examination revealed normal ovaries and a pedunculated mass with two-sided prominent cystic structures originating from the uterine fundus. The tumor was excised through the peduncle and pathologic evaluation revealed a uterine leiomyoma with cystic degenerations. In conclusion, a large, pedunculated leiomyoma with two-sided cystic degenerations can mimic a bilateral malignant ovarian neoplasm on imaging studies. Therefore, uterine leiomyomas with bilateral cystic degenerations should be considered during the differential diagnosis of malignant ovarian masses.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772928","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.78837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.732099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.615169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.563986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Abdominal mass","weight":0.277523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_mass"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.184531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Fish anatomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_anatomy"},{"name":"Fundus (uterus)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(uterus)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Pedunculated","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedunculated"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"}]}
