{"id":72820,"title":"Unusual location of chordoma metastasis.","abstract":"Chordoma is a rare tumor originating from the remnants of the notochord. The tumor is known as locally aggressive with a strong tendency for recurrence rather than metastasis.We reported on a case of a 47-year-old Caucasian male with a history of sacral chordoma with metastasis to the cicatrix.Skin involvement in chordoma is uncommon but, according to literature, possible. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there were no reports on incisional chordoma.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941302","annotations":[{"name":"Scar","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.136252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Notochord","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notochord"},{"name":"Chordoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordoma"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
