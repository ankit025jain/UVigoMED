{"id":8015,"title":"A novel siadenovirus detected in the kidneys and liver of Gouldian finches (Erythura gouldiae).","abstract":"A novel siadenovirus was found in six captive Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) in the United States and Hungary. Histopathological examination revealed inclusions in the kidney of the captive Gouldian finch in the United States, and virions morphologically consistent with adenoviruses were seen by electron microscopy. Partial sequence of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene was gained by consensus PCR and sequencing in all six finches, and all proved to be identical. In one Hungarian finch, additional sequence was obtained from the DNA polymerase gene, the pre-terminal protein (pTP) gene, the 52k gene, and the hexon gene. Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and distance-based analyses showed the novel virus clusters with the siadenoviruses, and is herein referred to as Gouldian finch adenovirus 1. The genes looked at in this study had low G+C percentages, which is common in the genus Siadenovirus, and suggestive of recent host switch. The significance of this virus' presence is unknown at this time as clinical signs of positive birds varied.
