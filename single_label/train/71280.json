{"id":71280,"title":"[The annexin 5 in serums of pregnant women and patients with particular types of cancer].","abstract":"The detection of biomarkers to be applied to reveal different types of tumors is an actual demand of today. Since course of this disease can be asymptomatic these kinds of markers can be applied in widely-distributed screening procedures. Many types of biomarkers for detection of cancer exist. However all these markers are specific only for particular type of tumor and have no use in screening procedures for detection of this pathology. The Annexin 5, a Ca-depended phospholipid binding protein, was discovered in serums of all pregnant women on various stages of pregnancy. The study was implemented using method of latex agglutination. More than that, this protein was detected in serums of patients with several types of cancer. The possibility to apply annexin 5 as marker for screening of various types of cancer is considered.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080795","annotations":[{"name":"Phospholipid","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.753561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Agglutination (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination_(biology)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
