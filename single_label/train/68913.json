{"id":68913,"title":"[Hemorrhoidal surgery: new trends for day-case surgery].","abstract":"Despite recommendations and encouragements, day-case hemorrhoidal surgery is incompletely developed. The incidence of postoperative pain, urinary retention and the risk of bleeding vary according to the surgical procedure but they are considered as the main impediments to ambulatory management. Consequently, besides the use of good clinical practice concerning ambulatory surgery, hemorrhoidal surgery requires an effective control of postoperative pain based on the use of pudendal block, an adaptation of the anesthetic technique and a careful postoperative follow-up.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485829","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.547712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Hemorrhoid","weight":0.36735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pudendal nerve","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudendal_nerve"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Outpatient surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_surgery"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
