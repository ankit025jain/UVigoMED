{"id":83202,"title":"Ganglion cyst of the temporomandibular joint.","abstract":"Ganglion cyst of the temporomandibular joint is a rare disease, which may arise from myxoid degeneration of the collagenous tissue of the temporomandibular joint capsule, without epithelial or endothelial lining. We report a case of cystic lesion in a 40-year-old female patient.The patient had a left pre-auricular oval-shaped swelling without any articular symptoms. The pathological analysis after surgical removal allowed diagnosing the lesion as a ganglion cyst of the left temporomandibular joint.We made a literature review and noted that this condition was predominant in female patients. We recommend using MRI for diagnostic purposes and surgery as the best therapeutic alternative.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412035","annotations":[{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.875328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.617411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.528363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.398214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Ganglion cyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cyst"},{"name":"Articular capsule","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular_capsule"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
