{"id":12853,"title":"Absence of interleukin-17 receptor a signaling prevents autoimmune inflammation of the joint and leads to a Th2-like phenotype in collagen-induced arthritis.","abstract":"Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) signals through the IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) A/C heterodimer. IL-17RA serves as a common receptor subunit for several IL-17 cytokine family members. Lack of IL-17RA signaling may therefore have additional effects beyond those of lack of IL-17A alone. The present study was undertaken to determine the role of IL-17RA signaling in autoimmune arthritis.Disease incidence and severity were scored in type II collagen-treated wild-type, IL-17RA-deficient, and IL-23p19-deficient mice. T helper cell profiles and humoral immune responses were analyzed at several time points. Pathogenicity of T cells and total splenocytes was determined by in vitro functional assay. IL-17RA signaling was blocked in vivo in mice with antigen-induced arthritis (AIA).Comparable to the findings in IL-23p19-deficient mice, IL-17RA-deficient mice were completely protected against the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). However, IL-17RA-deficient mice exhibited an increased number of IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells, distinct from IL-17A+CD4+ T cells. This was associated with fewer plasma cells, lower production of pathogenic IgG2c antibody, and increased production of IgG1 antibody. Both isolated CD4+ T cells and total splenocytes from IL-17RA-deficient mice had a reduced ability to induce IL-6 production by synovial fibroblasts in the setting of CIA, in a functional in vitro assay. Furthermore, blocking of IL-17RA signaling in AIA reduced synovial inflammation.These results demonstrate that absence of IL-17RA leads to a Th2-like phenotype characterized by IL-4 production and suggest that IL-17RA signaling plays a critical role in the regulation of IL-4 in CIA and the development of autoimmune inflammation of the joint.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504806","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.910871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.853954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.832922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.787412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.755792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.754147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.718219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.705518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.66819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.638042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.619353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.40617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.384808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.214399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.125558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
