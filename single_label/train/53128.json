{"id":53128,"title":"[Does carcinoma originating in the ovary exist?].","abstract":"According to the latest morphological and molecular knowledge it seems that the origin of epithelial ovarian cancers, i.e. carcinomas resides elsewhere than in the ovary, or that at least the early development of the disease takes place outside the ovary. According to the new scientific thought, tumors observed in the ovaries would be secondary processes by nature. Change of the viewpoint plays a crucial role in the development of prevention and early diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma. The new knowledge of the pathogenesis of ovarian carcinoma also opens possibilities for more effective post-operative treatments.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24547622","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.726557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.644358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.62678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.554255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.457728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.405093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.263112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.261098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.178514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"}]}
