{"id":71369,"title":"Case report: A breast cancer patient treated with GcMAF, sonodynamic therapy and hormone therapy.","abstract":"Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) occurs naturally in the human body. It has various functions, such as macrophage activation and antitumor activities. Recently, immunotherapy has become an attractive new strategy in the treatment of cancer. GcMAF-based immunotherapy can be combined with many other therapies. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) using low-intensity ultrasound is a novel therapeutic modality. Ultrasound has been demonstrated to activate a number of sonosensitive agents allowing for the possibility of non-invasive targeted treatment for both superficial and deep-seated tumors. The current case study demonstrates that GcMAF and SDT can be used in combination with conventional therapies in patients with metastatic cancer, especially where treatment options are limited due to factors such as toxicity. This case study also suggests a new concept of cancer treatment using local destruction of cancer tissue, in this case conducted with SDT, to be used in combination with GcMAF immunotherapy as a systemic treatment.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075104","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.484125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.390125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.347891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0521591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
