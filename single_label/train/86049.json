{"id":86049,"title":"Clinical effects of oseltamivir, zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir on seasonal influenza infection in outpatients in Japan during the winter of 2012-2013.","abstract":"The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir, zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir are available in Japan. However, the selective use of NAIs for treating outpatients with influenza has not been clearly defined.We assigned 191 patients with influenza to 4 groups, each treated with a different NAI, and then compared how long it took to alleviate fever and other symptoms and to eliminate the virus.Alleviation of fever occurred significantly sooner with peramivir than with either zanamivir (p = 0.0002) or oseltamivir (p = 0.0059), but was not significantly different from that with laninamivir (p = 0.0457; p < 0.0083). Other symptoms were also alleviated sooner by peramivir than by the other 3 NAIs.The ability of each NAI to alleviate influenza symptoms and fever varied. The appropriate use of NAIs requires further study.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24821568","annotations":[{"name":"Oseltamivir","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir"},{"name":"Neuraminidase","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Zanamivir","weight":0.613162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanamivir"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Flu season","weight":0.45626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Peramivir","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peramivir"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neuraminidase inhibitor","weight":0.121652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"}]}
