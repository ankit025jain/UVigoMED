{"id":86476,"title":"Fatal nitrofurantoin lung.","abstract":"Nitrofurantoin is a drug commonly used for urinary tract infections. It acts by damaging bacterial DNA. It is given in dose of 50-100 mg orally and is generally considered a safe drug but has occasionally been known to cause pulmonary toxicity which is usually reversible and only rarely fatal. We present a case of an elderly lady receiving nitrofurantoin for her urinary tract infection who developed sudden acute lung injury to which she finally succumbed within a few weeks.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772739","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.633539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nitrofurantoin","weight":0.368186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrofurantoin"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acute lung injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lung_injury"}]}
