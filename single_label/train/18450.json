{"id":18450,"title":"Imaging and management of postoperative spine infection.","abstract":"Imaging evaluation of postoperative spinal infection is challenging. A systematic approach and keen understanding of multimodality imaging techniques, as well as knowledge of the patient's surgical procedure and clinical presentation, are critical for the radiologist to render an accurate diagnosis. Because of the overlap between diagnostic imaging findings in the postoperative spine and the infected spine, in those situations in which the index of clinical suspicion for spine infection is high, then immediate consideration ought to be given to performing a spine biopsy.
