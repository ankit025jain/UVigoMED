{"id":91470,"title":"[Intensive therapy of uncontrolled internal hemorrhage before the surgical hemostasis conduction in polytrauma].","abstract":"The traumatic disease course was studied up in 287 injured persons with polytrauma and shock, 195 (67.9%) of them were admitted to hospital with continuing internal (noncontrolled) hemorrhage. The traumatic disease outcome was analyzed depending on the medical aid volume, delivered on prehospital stage, its duration, the arterial pressure level while admittance to the hospital and the blood loss volume. Maximal lethality was noted while nonconducting of infusion therapy on prehospital stage, as well as in aggressive infusion conduction with early normalization of arterial pressure; optimal outcome was achieved using intensive therapy before surgical hemostasis conduction while application of the hypotensive resuscitation regimen with minimal tissue perfusion and in systolic arterial pressure in the 80-90 mm Hg range.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502011","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.730262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.477214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Internal bleeding","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_bleeding"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Insulator (electrical)","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electrical)"},{"name":"Conduction (heat)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduction_(heat)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
