{"id":72788,"title":"Carmustine (BCNU) plus Teniposide (VM26) in recurrent malignant glioma.","abstract":"After the failure of radiotherapy and temozolomide, there is no established standard therapy for patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Based on the promising data of a previous trial (NOA-01) for primary GBM and some retrospective case series for GBM recurrence, the combination of nimustine and teniposide (VM26) was commonly used in this setting. When nimustine was no longer available in Europe, we switched to intrvaveneous carmustine (BCNU). Data on the toxicity and efficacy of BCNU and VM26 in recurrent GBM are lacking.In our neurooncological center, all patients with recurrent GBM or with progressed glioma and a typical MRI lesion suggesting GBM treated with BCNU (130-150 mg/m(2), day 1/42) and VM26 (45-60 mg/m(2), days 1-3/42) were analyzed retrospectively for progression-free survival, overall survival and toxicity.Fifteen patients (median age 52 years) were identified. Median progression-free survival was 2 months and median overall survival was 4 months. Two patients (14%) developed grade 3/4 hematotoxicity. Nonhematological toxicity ?grade 3 was not observed.Our data do not support the application of BCNU/VM26 in patients with late stages of recurrent GBM.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24942787","annotations":[{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.838795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Temozolomide","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temozolomide"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Teniposide","weight":0.826077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teniposide"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Carmustine","weight":0.780709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmustine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.748874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.576651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.305813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0513127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0312312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1342"},{"name":"VM (operating system)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
