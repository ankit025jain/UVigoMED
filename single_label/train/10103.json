{"id":10103,"title":"?7 Integrin controls mast cell recruitment, whereas ?E integrin modulates the number and function of CD8+ T cells in immune complex-mediated tissue injury.","abstract":"Immune complex (IC) deposition causes significant tissue injury associated with various autoimmune diseases such as vasculitis. In the cascade of inflammation, cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion via adhesion molecules are essential. To assess the role of ?E and ?7 integrin in IC-mediated tissue injury, peritoneal and cutaneous reverse-passive Arthus reaction was examined in mice lacking ?E integrin (?E(-/-)) or ?7 integrin (?7(-/-)). Both ?E(-/-) and ?7(-/-) mice exhibited significantly attenuated neutrophil infiltration in the peritoneal and cutaneous Arthus reaction. ?7 integrin deficiency, not ?E integrin deficiency, significantly reduced the number of mast cells in the peritoneal cavity, which was consistent with the result that mast cells expressed only ?4?7 integrin, not ?E?7 integrin. ?E(-/-) mice instead revealed the reduction of CD8(+) T cells in the peritoneal cavity, and nearly half of them in wild-type mice expressed ?E integrin. These ?E(+)CD8(+) T cells produced more proinflammatory cytokines than ?E(-)CD8(+) T cells, and adoptive transfer of ?E(+)CD8(+) T cell into ?E(-/-) recipients restored cutaneous and peritoneal Arthus reaction. These results suggest that in the peritoneal and cutaneous reverse-passive Arthus reaction, ?4?7 integrin is involved in the migration of mast cells for initial IC recognition. ?E?7 integrin, in contrast, contributes by recruiting ?E(+)CD8(+) T cells, which produce more proinflammatory cytokines than ?E(-)CD8(+) T cells and amplify IC-mediated inflammation.
