{"id":61906,"title":"Correlation between post kidney transplant anemia and kidney graft function.","abstract":"Posttransplant anemia (PTA) influences kidney graft function and prognosis; however, there is no consensus regarding target hemoglobin (Hb) levels.We examined several cases of PTA to identify any correlation between Hb levels and graft function. We evaluated 84 kidney transplant recipients (50 men and 34 women; mean age, 46.7 years) who were treated at our department between February 2004 and March 2012 and were available for a 2-year post-transplant follow-up.Hb levels and serum creatinine levels before transplantation and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after transplantation were compared. We examined the correlation between the degree of anemia and renal function among the patients. Data were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Friedman tests. The mean pretransplantation Hb level was 10.4 g/dL, whereas Hb levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after transplantation were significantly increased to 11.6, 12.2, and 12.4 g/dL, respectively, suggesting an improvement in anemia after the transplantation. Correlation analysis between anemia and kidney graft dysfunction revealed significant correlations at 1, 3, 12, and 24 months after transplantation. Subjects were stratified for correlation analysis according to Hb level at 24 months after transplantation: <10, 10-10.9, 11.0-11.9, 12.0-12.9, and ? 13.0 g/dL. A significant improvement in kidney graft function was noted in patients with an Hb level ? 11 g/dL at 2 years after transplantation. Anemia improved significantly by 3 months after transplantation.A significant correlation between PTA and kidney graft function was apparent, and the prognosis for kidney graft function was poor in patients with Hb levels ? 11 g/dL.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655998","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.862461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.806856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.803965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.701531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.676395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Milton Friedman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"1010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1010"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Spearman's rank correlation coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Canonical correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Parent-Teacher Association","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent-Teacher_Association"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
