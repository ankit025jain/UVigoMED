{"id":14611,"title":"[Cysticercus bovis in slaughtered cattle in the Afyonkarahisar and Burdur provinces and its importance from the point of view of public health].","abstract":"This study was conducted to determine the current status of bovine cysticercosis and human taeniosis in two provinces (Afyonkarahisar and Burdur in the western part of Turkey between October 2009 and October 2011).In the study period, a total of 1684 cattle and 7644 human stool samples were examined for Cysticercus bovis, and Taeniosis, respectively. Carcasses of animals were subjected to routine meat inspection. Stool samples of humans were analysed macroscopically and microscopically including direct and formaldehyde-ether sedimentation methods.C. bovis was determined in 0.24% of cattle by postmortem examination. The prevalence of infection was found to be 0.46% in Afyonkarahisar and 0.09% in Burdur. Taenia sp. eggs were shown in 0.1% of the human stool samples. The infection rate was detected as 0.1% and 0.09% in Afyonkarahisar and Burdur, respectively.This study is characterized as a preliminary investigation which offers useful information on a public health level within a short time at a low cost. Results obtained from this study cannot be generalized to study areas in epidemiological terms, but they are useful data for the relevant geography.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412867","annotations":[{"name":"Feces","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.744206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Cysticercosis","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercosis"},{"name":"Meat","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.444062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.440975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.291125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.225174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.201462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Carrion","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Afyonkarahisar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afyonkarahisar"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Burdur","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdur"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"1684","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1684"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Inspection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Cysticercoid","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercoid"},{"name":"Murder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Narrative mode","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
