{"id":51042,"title":"Effects of different intensities of physical exercise on insulin sensitivity and protein kinase B/Akt activity in skeletal muscle of obese mice.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of different intensities of acute exercise on insulin sensitivity and protein kinase B/Akt activity in skeletal muscle of obese mice.Swiss mice were randomly divided into four groups, and fed either a standard diet (control group) or high fat diet (obese sedentary group and obese exercise group 1 and 2) for 12 weeks. Two different exercise protocols were used: swimming for 1 hour with or without an overload of 5% body weight. The insulin tolerance test was performed to estimate whole-body sensitivity. Western blot technique was used to determine protein levels of protein kinase B/Akt and phosphorylation by protein Kinase B/Akt in mice skeletal muscle.A single bout of exercise inhibited the high fat diet-induced insulin resistance. There was increase in phosphorylation by protein kinase B/Akt serine, improve in insulin signaling and reduce of fasting glucose in mice that swam for 1 hour without overload and mice that swan for 1 hour with overload of 5%. However, no significant differences were seen between exercised groups.Regardless of intensity, aerobic exercise was able to improve insulin sensitivity and phosphorylation by protein kinase B/Ak, and proved to be a good form of treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728251","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.811676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.787712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.6451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.628391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.620071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.565524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.389795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.233519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.215641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.215183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.209746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Strength training","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.122971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Insulin tolerance test","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Human swimming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"}]}
