{"id":47247,"title":"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma and vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in patients with chronic hepatitis delta.","abstract":"No data exist to assess certain polymorphisms that have a potential effect on the immune response in patients with chronic hepatitis delta (CHD). The aim of this study was to investigate polymorphisms in 6 polymorphic sites: IL-10 -1082 (rs1800896), IL-10 -627 (rs1800872), IFN-? +874 (rs62559044), TNF-? -308 (rs1800629), vitamin D receptor (VDR) FokI (rs2228570) and VDR TaqI (rs731236). The genotypes of 67 patients with CHD and 119 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were compared. In addition, 56 individuals with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were used as a control group for patients with CHB. Polymorphisms in TNF-?, IL-10, and VDR genes were analysed using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. The IFN-? gene polymorphism was detected by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients with CDH were more likely to have advanced liver disease compared with patients with CHB (P < 0.0001). IL-10 -1082 and VDR TaqI polymorphisms showed significant differences between patients with CHD and CHB. The high secretory IL-10 -1082 genotype GG was less frequent in CHD compared with patients with CHB and resolved HBV (17.7%, 37.4% and 47.1%, respectively (P < 0.05 for CHD vs CHB and resolved HBV). The frequency of the high secretory VDR TaqI TT genotype was 86.6% in patients with CHD, 62.7% in patients with CHB and 62.5% in resolved HBV individuals (CHD vs CHB: P < 0.05). None of the polymorphisms analysed had an effect on HBV persistence. IL-10 -1082 and VDR TaqI polymorphisms may contribute to the more severe liver disease associated with CHD compared with CHB.
