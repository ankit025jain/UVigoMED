{"id":22132,"title":"Development of a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay for detection and subtyping of cholix toxin variant genes of Vibrio cholerae.","abstract":"Cholix toxin (ChxA) is an exotoxin reported in Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139. Apart from its prototype (ChxA I) we have recently identified two novel variants of this toxin, ChxA II and ChxA III. Our previous investigations indicated that the first two variants may instigate extra-intestinal infections and ChxA II can be more lethal than ChxA I in mice. However, all three cholix toxins (ChxA I to III) failed to show any enterotoxicity in rabbit ileal loops. In this study we developed a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay to differentiate all three chxA variants to further understand the importance of each subtype. By using 53 V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 strains harbouring chxA genes, which were previously categorized by sequencing, and various other strains as negative controls, the PCR-RFLP assay showed 100?% typability and specificity. Furthermore, when applied to differentiate additional V. cholerae strains, which were also screened for the chxA gene by colony hybridization, this assay identified chxA I and chxA II genes among 18.5?% and 4.5?% of non-O1/non-O139 strains (n?=?178), respectively. One non-O1/non-O139 strain was untypable due to the insertion of an IS911-like element. Interestingly, the chxA I gene was detected in 10 out of 137 cholera toxin gene-negative V. cholerae O1 strains. These results suggest that the PCR-RFLP assay developed in this study can be a rapid and simple method to differentiate the chxA subtypes.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568884","annotations":[{"name":"Cholera","weight":0.912945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"},{"name":"Cholera toxin","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_toxin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Vibrio cholerae","weight":0.626871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.551199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.492836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.441745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Exotoxin","weight":0.378049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotoxin"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.362428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.325722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.281725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.251998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0239857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Loop (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"O antigen","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_antigen"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Insertion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_(genetics)"}]}
