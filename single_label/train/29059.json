{"id":29059,"title":"Current safety practices in nano-research laboratories in China.","abstract":"China has become a key player in the global nanotechnology field, however, no surveys have specifically examined safety practices in the Chinese nano-laboratories in depth. This study reports results of a survey of 300 professionals who work in research laboratories that handle nanomaterials in China. We recruited participants at three major nano-research laboratories (which carry out research in diverse fields such as chemistry, material science, and biology) and the nano-chemistry session of the national meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society. Results show that almost all nano-research laboratories surveyed had general safety regulations, whereas less than one third of respondents reported having nanospecific safety rules. General safety measures were in place in most surveyed nano-research laboratories, while nanospecific protective measures existed or were implemented less frequently. Several factors reported from the scientific literature including nanotoxicology knowledge gaps, technical limitations on estimating nano-exposure, and the lack of nano-occupational safety legislation may contribute to the current state of affairs. With these factors in mind and embracing the precautionary principle, we suggest strengthening or providing nanosafety training (including raising risk awareness) and establishing nanosafety guidelines in China, to better protect personnel in the nano-workplace.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738449","annotations":[{"name":"Materials science","weight":0.822519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.774928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.755604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.556935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.463022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.460065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"China","weight":0.456175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Precautionary principle","weight":0.375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle"},{"name":"Legislation","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.155741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Nanomaterials","weight":0.133784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomaterials"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.120329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Nanotoxicology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotoxicology"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"American Chemical Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chemical_Society"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
