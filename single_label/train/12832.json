{"id":12832,"title":"Pathogenicity test of bacterial and fungal fish pathogens in Cirrihinus mrigala infected with EUS disease.","abstract":"The study was conducted for 8 weeks to determine pathogenic effect of different fish pathogens in Cirrihinus mrigal (C. mrigala) which was infected with EUS disease. The pathogenic organisms (bacteria and fungi) collected from the infected part of the disease fish. Isolation and screening of microbes were carried out with the help of a number of biochemical tests. A total of eight bacterial isolates were obtained from the diseased fish. Out of eight, six bacteria viz., Streptococcus grp Q1, Aeromonas hydrophilla, Shigella spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Cellobiosococcus sciuri, Micrococcus luteus were found to be pathogenic. The fungus, Aphanomyces invadens was also isolated from the diseased fishes. The pathogenicity of disease causing organisms was tested through in vitro and in vivo experiments in different treatments. The result of experiment was found to be significant at level of p < or = 0.05.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506024","annotations":[{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Shigella","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Aeromonas","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromonas"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.496564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecalis","weight":0.435257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis"},{"name":"Micrococcus","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrococcus"},{"name":"Soil life","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_life"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Micrococcus luteus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrococcus_luteus"},{"name":"Mrigal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrigal"},{"name":"Crayfish plague","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish_plague"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Euskaltel-Euskadi","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euskaltel-Euskadi"},{"name":"Mrigala","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrigala"}]}
