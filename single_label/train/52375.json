{"id":52375,"title":"Glucose turnover after replacement of usual therapy by insulin in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes subjects.","abstract":"Discontinuation of anti-hyperglycemic oral agents and initiation of insulin is recommended in certain clinical situations for inpatients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The effects on glucose turnover when these agents are acutely withdrawn are poorly understood and may be of importance when insulin therapy is initiated.Our objective was to investigate alterations in glucose turnover after acute withdrawal of noninsulin therapy.This was a randomized crossover study at a clinical research facility.Participants included 12 insulin-naive subjects with T2D.Subjects attended two 24-hour visits. Standard therapy was discontinued and replaced by closed-loop insulin delivery during the intervention visit. Usual anti-hyperglycemic therapy was continued during the control visit. Systemic glucose appearance (Ra) and glucose disposal (Rd) were measured using a tracer dilution technique with iv [6,6-(2)H2]glucose.Plasma glucose profiles during both visits were comparable (P = .48). Glucose Ra increased during the day (21.4 [19.5, 23.5] vs 18.6 [17.0, 21.6) ?mol/kg/min, P = .019) and decreased overnight (9.7 [8.5, 11.4] vs 11.6 [10.3, 12.9] ?mol/kg/min, P = .004) when the usual therapy was discontinued and replaced with insulin. Increased daytime glucose Rd (21.2 [19.4, 23.9] vs 18.8 [18.3, 21.7] ?mol/kg/min, P = .002) and decreased overnight Rd (10.4 [9.1, 12.0] vs 11.8 [10.7, 13.7] ?mol/kg/min, P = .005) were observed when the usual therapy was discontinued, whereas daytime peripheral insulin sensitivity was reduced (47.8 [24.8, 66.1] vs 62.5 [34.8, 75.8] nmol/kg/min per pmol/L, P = .034).In T2D, acute discontinuation of anti-hyperglycemic therapy and replacement with insulin increases postprandial Ra and reduces peripheral insulin sensitivity. Insulin dose initiation may need to compensate for these alterations.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606105","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.730649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.695495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.666133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.622487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.613796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.50129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.397389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.388084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.33047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.227016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.203387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.201543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Ra","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra"},{"name":"Douglas T2D","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_T2D"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
