{"id":67251,"title":"miR-96 promotes cell proliferation and clonogenicity by down-regulating of FOXO1 in prostate cancer cells.","abstract":"The present study aimed to investigate the biological functions of miR-96 in the processes of proliferation and clonogenicity in the prostate cancer cells. miR-96 was identified to be markedly up-regulated in prostate cancer cell and cancer tissues compared with normal prostate cell and normal prostate tissues by microarray method and RT-PCR analysis. Down-regulation of miR-96 expression reduced the proliferation and colony formation ability of PC3 prostate cancer cells, while over-expression of miR-96 induced proliferation and colony formation ability of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) is key tumor suppressors and has been shown to play key roles in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The expression level of FOXO1 was strikingly up-regulated in PC3 cells after transfected with miR-96 inhibitor, and FOXO1 expression was down-regulated in LNCaP cells after transfected with miR-96 mimics. miR-96 may play a vital role in promoting cell proliferation in human prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of miR-96 caused expression increase of tumor suppressor gene FOXO1, thus manipulating miR-96 expression may be a promising approach in treatment of prostate cancer.
