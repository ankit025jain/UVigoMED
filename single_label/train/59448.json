{"id":59448,"title":"[Clinical significance of changes in peripheral lymphocyte count after surgery in early cervical cancer].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical significance of changes in peripheral lymphocyte count after surgery in early cervical cancer.The 123 patients with stage Ib1 and IIa1 treated by abdominal type III radical hysterectomy from May 2008 to December 2012 were reviewed. The median age of patients was 43 years old (range: 30 to 66 years). The median follow-up was 25 months with a range of 5-61 months. Peripheral blood samples were obtained on pre-operative, post-operation day 3 and 7. The log-rank test was used to compare the homogeneity of progression-free survival functions across strata defined by categories of prognostic variables. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the significance of potential prognostic factors for progression-free survival.Univariate analyses preoperative lymphocyte count (P = 0.012) and lymph nodes metastases status (P = 0.001) and parametrial invasion (P = 0.013) were significant risk factors for progression-free survival rate. On multivariate analyses, preoperative lymphocyte count [hazard ratio (HR) = 6.087, 95%CI: 1.743-21.251, P = 0.005] and lymph nodes metastases status (HR = 5.984, 95%CI: 1.803-19.802, P = 0.003) were independent risk factor of progression-free survival rate.Peripheral lymphocyte counts after cervical cancer surgery may be a important prognostic factor.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Female
