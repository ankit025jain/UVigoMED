{"id":55872,"title":"Multifocal intraocular lens explantation: a case series of 50 eyes.","abstract":"To assess the visual complaints, reasons, and patient satisfaction for multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) explantation.Retrospective observational case series.This study evaluated 50 eyes of 37 patients who underwent multifocal IOL explantation followed by IOL implantation. Before and 3 months after IOL exchange surgery, we investigated the symptoms, reasons, patient demographics, clinical results, and patient satisfaction in eyes undergoing multifocal IOL explantation. Data collected included preoperative subjective and objective findings, reasons, IOL type, postoperative course, and patient satisfaction.The most common complaints for IOL explantation were waxy vision, followed by glare and halos, blurred vision at far, dysphotopsia, blurred vision at near, and blurred vision at intermediate. The most common reasons for IOL explantation were decreased contrast sensitivity, followed by photic phenomenon, unknown origin including neuroadaptation failure, incorrect IOL power, preoperative excessive expectation, IOL dislocation/decentration, and anisometropia. The axial length was 25.13±1.83 mm. Of the explanted multifocal IOLs, 84% were diffractive and 16% were refractive. Monofocal IOLs accounted for 90% of the exchanged IOLs. Patient satisfaction was significantly improved from 1.22±0.55 preoperatively to 3.78±0.97 postoperatively, which was graded on a scale of 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P<.001).Multifocal IOL explantation was required in some patients undergoing multifocal IOL implantation. IOL exchange surgery appears to be a feasible surgical option for dissatisfied patients with persistent visual symptoms after multifocal IOL implantation.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792105","annotations":[{"name":"Observation","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.720347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.682266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.617502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.587328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.531971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.408904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.376043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Halo (optical phenomenon)","weight":0.290321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Blurred vision","weight":0.140676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurred_vision"},{"name":"Diffraction","weight":0.139972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Anisometropia","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisometropia"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Glare (vision)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glare_(vision)"},{"name":"Neural adaptation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Expected value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"780","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/780"},{"name":"Photic zone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Wax","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"}]}
