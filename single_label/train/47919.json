{"id":47919,"title":"Gender and social disparities in esophagus cancer incidence in Iran, 2003-2009: a time trend province-level study.","abstract":"Esophagus cancer (EC) is among the five most common cancers in both sexes in Iran, with an incidence rate well above world average. Social rank (SR) of individuals and regions are well-known independent predictors of EC incidence. The aim of current study was to assess gender and social disparities in EC incidence across Iran's provinces through 2003-2009.Data on distribution of population at province level were obtained from the Statistical Centre of Iran. Age-standardized incidence rates of EC were gathered from the National Cancer Registry. The Human Development Index (HDI) was used to assess the province social rank. Rate ratios and Kunst and Mackenbach relative indices of inequality (RIIKM) were used to assess gender and social inequalities, respectively. Annual percentage change (APC) was calculated using joinpoint regression.EC incidence rate increased 4.6% and 6.5% per year among females and males, respectively. There were no gender disparities in EC incidence over the study period. There were substantial social disparities in favor of better-off provinces in Iran. These social disparities were generally the same between males and females and were stable over the study period.The results showed an inverse association between the provinces' social rank and EC incidence rate in Iran. In addition, I found that, in contrast with international trends, women are at the same risk of EC as men in Iran. Further investigations are needed to explain these disparities in EC incidence across the provinces.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568468","annotations":[{"name":"Human Development Index","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.725829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.719464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.670003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.619924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.402091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.122383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"International","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"European Economic Community","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community"},{"name":"International Criminal Court","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"List of Canadian provinces and territories by population","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_provinces_and_territories_by_population"},{"name":"Time series","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series"},{"name":"Government of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"List of countries by energy intensity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_energy_intensity"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Provinces of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Distribution (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(economics)"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Armoured personnel carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_personnel_carrier"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
