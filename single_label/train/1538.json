{"id":1538,"title":"Understanding the role of alcohol during rape: the perfect storm of attention, emotion, & expectancies.","abstract":"Sex offenders and violent offenders in general that were intoxicated at the time of their offense often claim that they were too intoxicated to know 1) what they were doing at the time of the offense and 2) therefore unable to recall the details of the offense situation the next day. What the literature has to say contradicts the claims of sex offenders or violent offenders who claim they were \"out of control\" and that they do not recall what they did in the offense situation. Alcohol use (mild to moderate consumption) appears to result in 1) alcohol myopia; 2) increased attentional focus on the more salient emotions (whether negative or positive); 3) improved creative thinking and improved attention to the activity at hand; 4) decreased frontal lobe activity (e.g., lack of concern about consequences or morals); 5) is impacted by alcohol expectancies; and 6) does not prevent an individual from being able to recall activity that occurred while intoxicated when provided cues.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345240","annotations":[{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.843477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Rape","weight":0.678479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.632809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.593674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.506901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.498665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.477647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Morality","weight":0.465752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sex offender","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_offender"},{"name":"Creativity","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Storm","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Cue (theatrical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_(theatrical)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Perfect storm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_storm"},{"name":"Recall election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Salients, re-entrants and pockets","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salients,_re-entrants_and_pockets"},{"name":"Expectancy theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectancy_theory"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
