{"id":37755,"title":"Nocturnal hypoxemia in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis.","abstract":"To determine the prevalence of nocturnal hypoxemia and its association with pulmonary function, nutritional status, sleep macrostructure, and obstructive respiratory events during sleep in a population of clinically stable children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF).This was a cross-sectional study involving 67 children and adolescents with CF between 2 and 14 years of age. All of the participants underwent polysomnography, and SpO2 was measured by pulse oximetry. We also evaluated the Shwachman-Kulczycki (S-K) scores, spirometry findings, and nutritional status of the patients.The study involved 67 patients. The mean age of the patients was 8 years. The S-K scores differed significantly between the patients with and without nocturnal hypoxemia, which was defined as an SpO2 < 90% for more than 5% of the total sleep time (73.75 ± 6.29 vs. 86.38 ± 8.70; p < 0.01). Nocturnal hypoxemia correlated with the severity of lung disease, FEV1 (rs = -0.42; p = 0.01), FVC (rs = -0.46; p = 0.01), microarousal index (rs = 0.32; p = 0.01), and apnea-hypopnea index (rs = 0.56; p = 0.01).In this sample of patients with CF and mild-to-moderate lung disease, nocturnal oxygenation correlated with the S-K score, spirometry variables, sleep macrostructure variables, and the apnea-hypopnea index.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473760","annotations":[{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.928562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.838542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.469408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.335266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.237526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"}]}
