{"id":90371,"title":"A more perfect union: reports from an interdisciplinary primary care clinic for patients with spinal cord injury.","abstract":"The literature suggests that patients with spinal cord injury may have limited physical access to health care, receive fewer preventive services than able-bodied patients, and rely on physiatrists to provide primary care services. In this essay, the authors - an internist and a physiatrist - reflect on a year-long experience of cooperatively caring for patients with spinal cord injury in an interdisciplinary setting.
