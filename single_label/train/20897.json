{"id":20897,"title":"First report of digital skin ulcer with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection in an immunocompetent patient.","abstract":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an aerobic Gram-negative bacillus that usually causes infection in immunocompromised patients. We present the case of an immunocompetent patient with a distal necrosis of the second and third fingers of the right hand caused by S. maltophilia infection. The patient underwent antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole on the basis of the susceptibility tests and underwent surgical debridement of the necrotic tissues, including of the distal phalanx bone, and further reconstruction with Atasoy flap. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is emerging as an important cause of skin infection in immunoresponsive patients. Several community-acquired infections have been reported, however, as far as we are aware of, our case represents the first report of a digital wound of intact skin caused by community-acquired S. maltophilia infection in an immunocompetent patient.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632983","annotations":[{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.761521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.5758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.525824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.518894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.518321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.385564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.343501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.241117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Distal phalanges","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_phalanges"},{"name":"Phalanx bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone"},{"name":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotrophomonas_maltophilia"},{"name":"Stenotrophomonas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotrophomonas"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"}]}
