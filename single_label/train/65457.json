{"id":65457,"title":"[Permanent iodine-125 implants brachytherapy: results after 10 years of experience in Li√®ge University Hospital].","abstract":"Permanent implant iodine-125 brachytherapy is an attractive treatment option for men with localized prostate cancer and is an alternative approach to radical prostatectomy. Overall survival and biochemical relapse free survival are similar with both treatments but the toxicity is different. More potency preservation, less incontinence and one day hospitalisation are attractive for the patient with brachytherapy. On the other side, pre-existing obstructive or irritative urinary symptoms at baseline have to guide the patient to a surgical approach. A patient has to be able to select one of these two therapeutic opportunities through a complete transparent information. In this paper, we related our permanent implant iodine-125 brachytherapy experience. Overall survival, biochemical relapse free survival and registred toxicity are similar to those published in the literature.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822303","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.620168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.506837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.320466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.215315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.110231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.0973629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
