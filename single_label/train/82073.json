{"id":82073,"title":"Coronally advanced flap versus the pouch technique combined with a connective tissue graft to treat Miller's class I gingival recession: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to compare two different periodontal plastic surgery procedures to treat Miller's class I recession: a coronally advanced flap(control group) versus the pouch technique (test group), both of which were associated with connective tissue graft.Forty consecutive patients were included, with 20 patients being allocated for each group. The level of recession coverage, the keratinized tissue (KT)quantity, gingival aesthetics (PES) and post-operative outcomes were assessed for a follow-up period of 6 months.After 6 months, both techniques allowed for the excellent mean root coverage of 96.3 plus/minus 12.1% in the control group and of 91.3 plus/minus 17.6% in the test group.Complete root coverage was achieved in 89.5% (17/19) and 79% (15/19) of the recession cases in the control and the test groups respectively. A significant increase in KT height (p = 0.0011) was observed in the test group. A significant improvement in the pink aesthetic score was found in the two groups, but gingival texture displayed significantly better results in the test group (p < 0.0001). No significant difference between the two groups was found in terms of the morbidity outcomes. Pain killer consumption was similar in the two groups and significantly decreased over time.Both surgical techniques are relevant in treating Miller's class I recession. The pouch technique seems to increase the height of KT better and provides good gingival-related aesthetic outcomes.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720640","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.898663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.823007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.552663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.469957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.462923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.308892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Keratin","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.173167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.168905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Receding gums","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receding_gums"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Order of the Thistle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Thistle"},{"name":"Gingival graft","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_graft"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1519","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1519"},{"name":"1719","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1719"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Pink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Late-2000s recession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession"},{"name":"Party of European Socialists","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_European_Socialists"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Mouthfeel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthfeel"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"}]}
