{"id":60688,"title":"Assessing diagnostic accuracy of Haemoglobin Colour Scale in real-life setting.","abstract":"The study was undertaken to determine diagnostic accuracy of Haemoglobin Colour Scale (HCS) in hands of village-based community health workers (CHWs) in real-life community setting in India. Participants (501 women) were randomly selected from 8 villages belonging to a project area of SEWA-Rural, a voluntary organization located in India. After receiving a brief training, CHWs and a research assistant obtained haemoglobin readings using HCS and HemoCue (reference) respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive-values, and likelihood ratios were calculated. Bland-Altman plot was constructed. Mean haemoglobin value, using HCS and HemoCue were 11.02 g/dL (CI 10.9-11.2) and 11.07 g/dL (CI 10.9-11.2) respectively. Mean difference between haemoglobin readings was 0.95 g/dL. Sensitivity of HCS was 0.74 (CI 0.65-0.81) and 0.84 (CI 0.8-0.87) whereas specificity was 0.84 (CI:0.51-0.98) and 0.99 (CI:0.97-0.99) using haemoglobin cutoff limits of 10 g/dL and 7 g/dL respectively. CHWs can accurately diagnose severe and moderately-severe anaemia by using HCS in real-life field condition after a brief training.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847593","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.647588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"India","weight":0.596395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.588474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.575134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.342646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.23144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.222201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0508123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"650","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/650"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/970"},{"name":"Plot (narrative)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)"},{"name":"9-1-1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1"},{"name":"Research assistant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_assistant"},{"name":"Health in Ethiopia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_in_Ethiopia"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Charitable organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"}]}
