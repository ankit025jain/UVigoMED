{"id":88105,"title":"Feasibility of sensory tongue stimulation combined with task-specific therapy in people with spinal cord injury: a case study.","abstract":"Previous evidence suggests the effects of task-specific therapy can be further enhanced when sensory stimulation is combined with motor practice. Sensory tongue stimulation is thought to facilitate activation of regions in the brain that are important for balance and gait. Improvements in balance and gait have significant implications for functional mobility for people with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). The aim of this case study was to evaluate the feasibility of a lab- and home-based program combining sensory tongue stimulation with balance and gait training on functional outcomes in people with iSCI.Two male participants (S1 and S2) with chronic motor iSCI completed 12 weeks of balance and gait training (3 lab and 2 home based sessions per week) combined with sensory tongue stimulation using the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS). Laboratory based training involved 20 minutes of standing balance with eyes closed and 30 minutes of body-weight support treadmill walking. Home based sessions consisted of balancing with eyes open and walking with parallel bars or a walker for up to 20 minutes each. Subjects continued daily at-home training for an additional 12 weeks as follow-up.Both subjects were able to complete a minimum of 83% of the training sessions. Standing balance with eyes closed increased from 0.2 to 4.0 minutes and 0.0 to 0.2 minutes for S1 and S2, respectively. Balance confidence also improved at follow-up after the home-based program. Over ground walking speed improved by 0.14 m/s for S1 and 0.07 m/s for S2, and skilled walking function improved by 60% and 21% for S1 and S2, respectively.Sensory tongue stimulation combined with task-specific training may be a feasible method for improving balance and gait in people with iSCI. Our findings warrant further controlled studies to determine the added benefits of sensory tongue stimulation to rehabilitation training.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906679","annotations":[{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.699037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.653976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.528154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.41761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Gait training","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_training"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.134422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Parallel bars","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Warrant (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)"},{"name":"Bar (establishment)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(establishment)"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Parallel (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry)"},{"name":"Resistance training","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_training"},{"name":"Requirements management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management"},{"name":"New Zealand Residents rugby league team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Residents_rugby_league_team"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Naismith's Rule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith's_Rule"},{"name":"Treadmill","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill"}]}
