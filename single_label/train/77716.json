{"id":77716,"title":"[Is the guideline for work-related medical rehabilitation successfully implemented?].","abstract":"The guideline for work-related medical rehabilitation (WMR) in responsibility of the German Pension Insurance describes standards of work-related measures in medical rehabilitation. We investigated if contents and recommended amount of treatment were successfully implemented and which improvements were associated with the implementation.Implementation of the WMR guideline was evaluated at 7 inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation centres. Patients completed questionnaires at beginning of rehabilitation, at dis-charge and 3 months after discharge. Details -regarding the treatments provided were extracted from the standardised discharge report.The recommended amount of social counselling and work-related psychosocial therapy measures were appropriate. However, there were discrepancies regarding the recommended amount of functional capacity training. The standardised mean difference (SMD) between baseline and 3-month follow-up sick leave duration indicated an almost medium-sized effect (SMD=0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.66). An additional 5 h of work-related therapy was associated with a 1.2-week decrease in sick leave duration (95% CI: -2.38 to -0.03).The guideline was for the most part successfully implemented and sets important standards for the roll-out of WMR. The nationwide implementation of the WMR guideline requires a continuous quality assurance that -enables promptly feedback about the achieved implementation level.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390869","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.436682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.413732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.33674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.334671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Sick leave","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pension","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Rollout (poker)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollout_(poker)"},{"name":"Set theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_and_Manawatu_Railway_Company"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
