{"id":3102,"title":"Outpatient cervical ripening by nitric oxide donors for prolonged pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"To assess whether outpatient cervical ripening at 41 0/7 weeks of gestation with the nitric oxide donor isosorbide mononitrate reduces cesarean delivery rates in nulliparous women with an unfavorable cervix.We recruited nulliparous pregnant women with a Bishop score less than 6 in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Women received 40 mg vaginal isosorbide mononitrate or a placebo at 41 0/7, 41 2/7, and 41 4/7 weeks of gestation. They returned home between visits. At 41 5/7 weeks of gestation, for women who had not yet given birth, labor was induced with oxytocin or prostaglandins, depending on cervical status. We needed 685 women per group to detect a 25% reduction in the cesarean delivery rate, the primary outcome measure, from 25% in the placebo group to 18.75% in the isosorbide mononitrate group (1-?=0.8, ?=0.05, two-sided).The NOCETER (NO donors for reduction of CEsareans at TERm) trial was a negative study. The cesarean delivery rate was 27.3% (185/678) in the isosorbide mononitrate group and 27.2% (186/684) in the placebo group (relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-1.19). None of the maternal secondary efficacy outcomes differed between groups. Side effects were more common among women receiving isosorbide mononitrate than in the placebo group (78.8% [534/678] compared with 27.9% [191/684], relative risk 2.82, 95% CI 2.49-3.20). Composite perinatal morbidity did not differ between groups.Outpatient cervical ripening with vaginal isosorbide mononitrate for prolonged pregnancy in nulliparous women does not reduce cesarean delivery rate.","date":"2014-11-22","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415159","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.892072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.800863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Oxytocin","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.750358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.728598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.584221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.548762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.546828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.521852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.202559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Bishop score","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_score"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"}]}
