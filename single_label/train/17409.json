{"id":17409,"title":"Life-threatening rupture of an external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm caused by necrotizing fasciitis following laparoscopic radical cystectomy: a case report.","abstract":"Pseudoaneurysms are caused by trauma, tumors, infections, vasculitis, atherosclerosis and iatrogenic complications. In this paper, we report about a patient with rupture of an external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm, which lead to hemorrhagic shock, after undergoing laparoscopic radical cystectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy.The patient was a 68-year-old Japanese male diagnosed with invasive bladder cancer. Laparoscopic radical cystectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed. On postoperative day 12, he developed a high fever and an acute inflammatory response with redness and swelling in the right inguinal region. He was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and underwent debridement. On postoperative day 42, a sudden hemorrhage developed from the open wound in the right inguinal region. He was diagnosed with external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm rupture by computed tomography.These complications occur extremely rarely after cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. There are no reports to date on these complications following laparoscopic cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885366","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.842257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.82664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.741261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.72334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.64757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.581676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.534078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.511784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.508927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Necrotizing fasciitis","weight":0.459737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_fasciitis"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Inguinal canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_canal"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Inguinal hernia","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Iliac vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliac_vein"}]}
