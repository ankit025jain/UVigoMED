{"id":92028,"title":"Gamma nail in the treatment of closed trochanteric fractures. Results and indications of 121 cases.","abstract":"The Gamma Nail is the latest advance in the treatment of trochanteric fractures based on intramedullary nailing principles during closed procedures. Its design is based on KÃ¼ntscher's Y-nail and locking intramedullary (IM) nails. This paper reports the results from the first-ever series of 121 patients operated between 1988 and 1990. They were followed until bone union was achieved. The mean patient age was 75 years. Most patients were in poor general health and had unstable fractures. Anatomical preoperative reduction was achieved in 72% of cases. Fixation was good in 66% of cases and acceptable in 27% of cases. Intra-operative complications consisted of nine fractures without consequences. Of the treated patients, 83.4% resumed weight-bearing during the first week. There was one case of deep infection that resolved with treatment. The mortality rate was 12.3% at three months. We noted 7 alunions in varus, 3 in valgus, 2 in external rotation and 1 in internal rotation. There were no cases of non-union. In six cases, the screw had cut out of the femoral head. The drawbacks associated with surgical treatment methods for trochanteric fractures also apply to the Gamma nail. Nevertheless, one of its primary advantages is the possibility of using a closed procedure. When compared to Ender nailing, knee pain is absent and weight-bearing can be achieved in all patients, no matter the fracture type.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456767","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.712304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.689777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.500111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.498681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.371385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.304581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.303316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Internal rotation","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rotation"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0642264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Ender Wiggin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Varus deformity","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varus_deformity"}]}
