{"id":88984,"title":"A case of penetrating glass foreign body within the renal cortex.","abstract":"A 32-year-old patient sustained a penetrating injury to the left flank and kidney after a fall backward onto a glass table. On computed tomography imaging, a 12×10×4 cm glass shard was identified penetrating the renal cortex. The patient was taken to the operating room to remove the foreign object. A rubber-shodded clamp was used to successfully remove the glass shard without complication. Although we commonly encounter stab wounds at our trauma center, the penetrating object is rarely present. The presence of the glass object resulted in a technically challenging and rare case.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768015","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.736147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.509082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.304209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.271573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Stabbing","weight":0.159155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabbing"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Renal cortex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cortex"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Flanking maneuver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanking_maneuver"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Clamp (tool)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamp_(tool)"},{"name":"A32 autoroute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A32_autoroute"}]}
