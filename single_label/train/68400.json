{"id":68400,"title":"Multimodal cell tracking of a spontaneous metastasis model: comparison between MRI, electron paramagnetic resonance and bioluminescence.","abstract":"MRI cell tracking is a promising technique for tracking various cell types in living animals. Usually, cells are incubated with iron oxides so that the particles are taken up before the cells are injected in vivo. In the present study, we aimed to monitor migration of luciferase-expressing mouse renal cancer cells (RENCA-luc) after intrarenal or intrasplenic injection. These cells were labelled using Molday Ion Rhodamine B (MIRB) fluorescent superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. Their fate after injection was first assessed using ex vivo X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. This biodistribution study showed that RENCA-luc cells quickly colonized the lungs and the liver after intrarenal and intrasplenic injection, respectively. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) studies confirmed that this cell line preferentially metastasized to these organs. Early tracking of labelled RENCA-luc cells in the liver using high-field MRI (11.7?T) was not feasible because of a lack of sensitivity. MRI of MIRB-labelled RENCA-luc cells after injection in the left kidney was then performed. T2 - and T2 *-weighted images showed that the labelled cells induced hypointense signals at the injection site. Nevertheless, the hypointense regions tended to disappear after several days, mainly owing to dilution of the MIRB iron oxides with cell proliferation. In conclusion, EPR is well adapted to ex vivo analysis of tissues after cell tracking experiments and allows short-term monitoring of metastasizing cells. MRI is a suitable tool for checking labelled cells at their injection site, but dilution of the iron oxides owing to cell division remains a major limitation. BLI remains the most suitable technique for long-term monitoring of metastatic cells.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Male Urogenital
