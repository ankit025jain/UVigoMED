{"id":58139,"title":"Ectopic pregnancy and laparoscopy.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the success of surgical procedures performed by laparoscopy and laparotomy in the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy.In this prospective study, there were 57 women who were operated due to tubal ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 36 women (study group). Conventional abdominal surgical treatment was performed in 21 women (control group).Among 36 women from study group, a laparoscopic linear salpingotomy was performed in 69.44% cases, salpingectomy in 13.88% cases, and milking of tube in 16.66% cases. In the control group, linear salpingotomy was performed in 57.14% cases, salpingectomy in 28.57% cases, and milking of tube in 14.28% cases. Patent ipsilateral fallopian tube at three months after surgery was 66.66% in the study group and 52.38% in the control group. The intrauterine pregnancy rate was 19.44% in the study group and 19.05% in the control group.The percentage of tubal patency and intrauterine pregnancies after laparoscopical surgical treatment was not higher than after conventional surgical treatment by laparotomy.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992775","annotations":[{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Salpingectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salpingectomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.207664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0542089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Milking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milking"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
