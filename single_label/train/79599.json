{"id":79599,"title":"Effects of azadirachtin on the biology of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) adult female, the main vector of American visceral leishmaniasis.","abstract":"The effects of azadirachtin A added to the sucrose diet of the adult females on the mortality, oviposition, and hatching of the sand fly vector of American visceral leishmaniasis Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) were investigated. Concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 microg/mg of azadirachtin significantly increased insect mortality in comparison with control insects. The same dose also significantly reduced oviposition but not hatching. After a long development period, significantly fewer adult insects were obtained from eggs hatching by azadirachtin-treated females in a dose-response manner. These results indicate that azadirachtin is a potent sterilizer that could be used against the development of Lu. longipalpis populations and as a tool for studying physiological and biochemical processes in phlebotomine species.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118426","annotations":[{"name":"Fly","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Insect","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Lutzomyia","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutzomyia"},{"name":"Psychodidae","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodidae"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.671419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.592615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Phlebotominae","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebotominae"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Azadirachtin","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azadirachtin"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.332142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.159996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Sand","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand"},{"name":"Visceral leishmaniasis","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visceral_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Sandfly","weight":0.0972222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandfly"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Neiva, Huila","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neiva,_Huila"},{"name":"Oviposition","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviposition"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Autoclave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
