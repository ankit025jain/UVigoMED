{"id":16858,"title":"Use of TaqMan® real-time PCR for rapid detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi.","abstract":"We evaluated the performances of a newly designed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using TaqMan® probes to detect Salmonella Typhi. TaqMan® real-time PCR assays were performed by designed primers and probe based on the staG gene for detecting S. Typhi. The specificity of the assay was evaluated on 15 Salmonella serovars. The analytical specificity was evaluated on 20 non-Salmonella microorganisms. The analytical sensitivity was assessed using decreasing DNA quantities of S. Typhi ATCC 19430. Finally the detection capability of the TaqMan® real-time PCR assay on isolates recovered from patients with Salmonella infections was compared to the conventional PCR assay. Only S. Typhi strain had positive results when subjected to the assay using Typhi-specific real-time PCR. No amplification products were observed in real-time PCR with any of the non-Salmonella microorganisms tested. The TaqMan® real-time PCR was more sensitive than the conventional PCR. In conclusion, we found that the easy-to-use real-time PCR assays were faster than conventional PCR systems. The staG-based TaqMan® real-time PCR assay showed to be specific and sensitive method for the safe and rapid detection of the S. Typhi.
