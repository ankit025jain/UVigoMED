{"id":22029,"title":"Long-term pretreatment with proton pump inhibitor and Helicobacter pylori eradication rates.","abstract":"To investigate whether proton pump inhibitor (PPI) pretreatment influences Helicobacter pylori eradication rate.We retrospectively reviewed H. pylori-infected patients who were treated with a standard triple regimen (PPI, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, all twice daily for 7 d). The diagnosis of H. pylori infection and its eradication was assessed with the rapid urease test, histological examination by silver staining, or the ¹³C-urea breath test. We divided the patients into two groups: one received the standard eradication regimen without PPI pretreatment (Group A), and the other received PPI pretreatment (Group B). The patients in Group B were reclassified into three groups based on the duration of PPI pretreatment: Group B-I (3-14 d), Group B-II (15-55 d), and Group B-III (? 56 d).A total of 1090 patients were analyzed and the overall eradication rate was 80.9%. The cure rate in Group B (81.2%, 420/517) was not significantly different from that in Group A (79.2%, 454/573). The eradication rates in Group B-I, B-II and B-III were 80.1% (117/146), 81.8% (224/274) and 81.4% (79/97), respectively.PPI pretreatment did not affect H. pylori eradication rate, regardless of the medication period.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574779","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Clarithromycin","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarithromycin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.757355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Breath test","weight":0.162334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_test"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0555992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"1555","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1555"},{"name":"1090","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1090"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"G-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"British Institute of Innkeeping Awarding Body","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Institute_of_Innkeeping_Awarding_Body"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Business intelligence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence"}]}
