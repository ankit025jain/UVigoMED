{"id":79560,"title":"The advent of ivermectin: people, partnerships, and principles.","abstract":"The 2014 Gairdner Global Health Award has been given for the discovery of the microorganism and industry partnership that resulted in the appearance of ivermectin, possibly the world's most successful human health tool. The chemist responsible for the discovery, Satoshi ?mura, also found many other microbial metabolites which have been the origin of novel, impactful drugs. The award emphasizes that multidisciplinary and equitable partnerships, often international in scope, are the key to advances in virtually all branches of science in the modern era.
