{"id":84985,"title":"Four cases of contralateral pneumothorax after pneumonectomy.","abstract":"Contralateral pneumothorax after pneumonectomy (CPAP) is a rare but potentially fatal condition. Therefore, when treating CPAP prevention of recurrence is very important. Despite a number of case reports about CPAP, its management is still controversial. We describe 4 cases of CPAP that were treated successfully by bullectomy and coverage with absorbable polyglactin mesh.
