{"id":90398,"title":"Algorithm for anticoagulation management in geriatric hip fracture patients--Surgeons save Blood.","abstract":"During the past decades, the number of hip fractures has been increasing steadily. Perioperative thromboprophylaxis has become a routine aspect in the care of geriatric hip fracture patients. In addition, a large proportion of these patients are already anticoagulated because of internistic comorbidities before they sustained the hip fracture. Although the management of preexisting anticoagulation in both orthopedic elective and emergency procedures is well reported, proximal femoral fractures are classified as \"acute\" and therefore represent neither of these two categories. In this study, we review the different options of handling preexisting anticoagulation and antiaggregation as well as perioperative thromboprophylaxis. The Innsbruck Algorithm for the management of anticoagulation in geriatric hip fracture patients suggests how perioperative bleeding risk can be minimized, while still addressing the underlying disease.
