{"id":89589,"title":"Virtual reality game-based therapy for treatment of postural and co-ordination abnormalities secondary to TBI: a pilot study.","abstract":"The study objective was to test the efficacy of game-based virtual reality (VR) therapy as a mean of correcting postural and co-ordination abnormalities in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therapy was done with interactive customized VR games and scenarios, utilizing an Xbox Kinect sensor.The study was a pilot project using the structure of a phase II clinical trial.Fifteen participants with mild-to-moderate chronic TBI-related balance and motor co-ordination impairments participated in 15 sessions, each lasting ?50-55 minutes, scheduled 2-3 times a week over 5-6 consecutive weeks. Participants were evaluated at baseline, immediately after the final session and in a 1-month follow-up with a battery of clinical tests (measuring postural stability, gait and co-ordination) and movement performance parameters. Movement parameters included arm-leg co-ordination, dynamic stability and arm precision, calculated from kinematic data recorded with Xbox Kinect sensor.Following therapy, most participants improved their static and dynamic postural stability, gait and arm movements. These effects persisted over the retention interval.Results will be used to improve the VR program, with the goal of producing a cost-effective, accessible and easy to individualize therapeutic approach. The pilot data will be used for designing a larger scale clinical trial.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and
