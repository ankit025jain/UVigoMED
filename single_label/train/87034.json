{"id":87034,"title":"Initial radiographic features as outcome predictor of adult respiratory syncytial virus respiratory tract infection.","abstract":"The purposes of this study were to evaluate the chest radiographic features of adult patients hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus respiratory tract infections and to assess whether initial chest radiographic findings help predict clinical outcome.All adult patients hospitalized from January 2009 to December 2011 with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus infection were included in the study. Patient clinical data and admission chest radiographs were retrospectively reviewed. Adverse outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, need for assisted ventilation, and death.Of 285 patients (mean age, 74 Â± 16 years) included, 199 (69.8%) had abnormal chest radiographic findings: 49.5% (141/285) had acute changes, and 47.7% (136/285) had chronic changes. Consolidation (68/141 [48.2%]) and ground-glass opacity (57/141 [40.4%]) were the predominant types of acute changes and were most common in unilateral single-lower-zone involvement. Consolidation, ground-glass opacity, and chronic changes occurred with significantly higher frequency in patients with adverse outcomes. The presence of acute (odds ratio, 3.6) and chronic (odds ratio, 2.2) changes were independent risk factors for mortality.A large proportion of adult patients hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus respiratory tract infection had changes on initial chest radiographs. Consolidation or ground-glass opacity in a unilateral single-lower-zone distribution were the most common findings. The presence of acute and chronic radiographic lung changes was associated with adverse outcomes.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055260","annotations":[{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.701987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Human respiratory syncytial virus","weight":0.683495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.670587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.509074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.364902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Syncytium","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytium"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"}]}
