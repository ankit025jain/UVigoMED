{"id":34353,"title":"Going against the flow: a case for peroxisomal protein export.","abstract":"Peroxisomes play a crucial role in regulating cellular metabolism, providing compartments where metabolic pathways can be contained and controlled. Their importance is underlined by the developmental brain disorders caused by peroxisome malfunction, while disturbances in peroxisome function also contribute to ageing. As peroxisomes do not contain DNA, they rely on an active transport system to obtain the full quota of proteins required for function. Organelle protein transport however, is rarely a one-way process and exciting recent data have demonstrated that peroxisomes can selectively export membrane and matrix proteins to fulfil specific functions. This review will summarise the current knowledge on peroxisomal membrane and matrix protein export, discussing the mechanisms underlying export as well as the role of peroxisomal protein export in peroxisomal and cellular function.
