{"id":44818,"title":"Effects of thermotherapy on Th1/Th2 cells in esophageal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of double radiofrequency hyperthermia on Th1/Th2 cells in esophageal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.22 patients with esophageal cancer were divided into a radiotherapy group (10 cases) and a combined group (double radiofrequency hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy group, 12 cases). Both groups received conventional radiotherapy using a cobalt-60 therapy apparatus (TD60-66Gy/30-33F). Patients in the combined group also underwent double radiofrequency hyperthermia (2F/W, 8-10F). Before and after treatment, Th1, Th2, Tc1 and Tc2 cells in peripheral blood were determined with flow cytometry.In the radiotherapy group, Th1 cell contents before and after radiotherapy were 17.5 ± 5.26% and 9.69 ± 4.86%, respectively, with a significant difference (p<0.01). The Th1/Th2 ratio was significantly decreased from 28.2 ± 14.3 to 16.5 ± 10.4 (p<0.01). In the combined group, Th1 cell content before radiotherapy was 15.9 ± 8.18%, and it increased to 18.6 ± 8.84 after radiotherapy (p>0.05), the Th1/Th2 ratio decreasing from 38.4 ± 36.3 to 28.1 ± 24.0 (p>0.05). Changes in Th2, Tc1 and Tc2 cell levels were not significant in the two groups before and after therapy (p>0.05).Double radiofrequency hyperthermia can promote the conversion from Th2 to Th1 cells, and regulate the balance of Th1/Th2 cells.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716984","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.76648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.563138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.545374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Cobalt","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt"},{"name":"Heat therapy","weight":0.0818934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_therapy"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.0369874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0184033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/810"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Double (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Territorial Decoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Decoration"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Group 10 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_10_element"}]}
