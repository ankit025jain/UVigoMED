{"id":70198,"title":"Screening, early detection, education, and trends for melanoma: current status (2007-2013) and future directions: Part II. Screening, education, and future directions.","abstract":"New evidence has accumulated over the past several years that supports improved melanoma outcomes associated with both clinician and patient screening. Population-based and workplace studies conducted in Australia and the Unites States, respectively, have shown decreases in the incidence of thick melanoma and overall melanoma mortality, and a year-long statewide screening program in Germany has shown a nearly 50% reduction in mortality 5 years after the screening ended. Current melanoma screening guidelines in the United States are inconsistent among various organizations, and therefore rates of both physician andÂ patient skin examinations are low. As policymaking organizations update national screening recommendations in the United States, the latest research reviewed in part II of this continuing medical education article should be considered to establish the most effective recommendations. Patient and provider education will be necessary to ensure that appropriate patients receive recommended screening.
