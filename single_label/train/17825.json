{"id":17825,"title":"Helicobacter pylori prevalence in children influenced by non-specific antibiotic treatments.","abstract":"Helicobacter pylori (H.p.) infections play a very important role in the development of ulcerations and malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract. It is assumed that the primary infection occurs during childhood, depending on numerous environmental factors among them hygiene and social status. Our aim was to determine whether treatment with antibiotics affects the persistence of H.p. infection.In 2006, we conducted an epidemiological study among all grade 8 students in the city of Leipzig (mean age 14.6 years). To determine the prevalence of H.p. infection, a voluntary H.p. test (13C-urea breath test) was performed in all participants.The H.p. prevalence was 6.3% (N = 1,598). A significant difference was found between those students who had been treated with an antibiotic at least once prior to the test and those who had never received any antibiotics (4.0% and 11.1%, respectively, p < 0.001). H.p. prevalence decreased with increasing numbers of antibiotic treatments.In adolescence, treatment with \"non-H.p. specific\" antibiotics appears to significantly affect H.p. prevalence. Moreover, the actual persistence of H.p. in \"chronic persistent\" H.p. infections appears to fluctuate at least in younger years. Thus, any \"non-H.p. specific\" antibiotic treatment should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of H.p. infections and should be taken into account as an important confounder in future epidemiological studies.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844107","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.720698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Leipzig","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.220677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Social status","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_status"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Epidemiological study","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological_study"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Breath test","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_test"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"}]}
