{"id":45623,"title":"Image-guided sharp recanalization of a benign J pouch anastomotic occlusion facilitates surgical repair.","abstract":"A 27-year-old man with a 9-year history of ulcerative colitis who had undergone total proctocolectomy with construction of a continent pouch in 2008 presented 1 year later with occlusion of the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis precluding ileostomy closure. An attempt at surgical reconstruction at an outside hospital failed, and the patient was informed that he would have a permanent stoma. A further attempt at blind surgical recanalization of the occlusion risked sphincter damage and was deferred. In 2010, reconstruction was performed using a hybrid approach combining image-guided sharp recanalization of the occluded anastomosis with positioning of a large-diameter Foley balloon catheter across the recanalized segment, followed by immediate surgical revision of the J pouch. Ileostomy closure was performed 1 month later. Continence was preserved. Surgical repair preceded by sharp recanalization with positioning of a balloon catheter across the occluding membrane may safely regain durable patency in a chronically occluded ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.
