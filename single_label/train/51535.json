{"id":51535,"title":"A simple and general method for preparing antibody-PEG-PLGA sub-micron particles using electrospray technique: an in vitro study of targeted delivery of cisplatin to ovarian cancer cells.","abstract":"Cisplatin-encapsulating maleimide-polyethylene glycol- Poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolide) (cis-encapsulating mal-PEG-PLGA) particles were produced using the electrospray technique and bioconjugated with CD44 monoclonal antibody, targeting the counterpart receptor. The produced suspension of cis-encapsulating CD44-PEG-PLGA particles contains an antibody loading of 12.65-15.17 ?g/mL and efficiently targets a CD44-overexpressed ovarian cancer cell line, such as CP70 and SKOV-3, within 6h of treatment, which was determined by Bradford assay, immunofluorescence analysis, and confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) study. Most importantly, no tedious multi-step bioconjugation procedures are needed to synthesize mal-PEG-PLGA vehicles for antibody and drug loading, avoiding the undesirable hydrolysis of mal-PEG moiety and so successfully generating the cis-encapsulating mal-PEG-PLGA particles within one step. After conjugation of the CD44 antibody, the produced cis-encapsulating CD44-PEG-PLGA particles exhibited a better anti-proliferative ability against ovarian cancer cells compared to free form of cisplatin and PLGA particles without CD44 conjugation. Notably, the cis-encapsulating CD44-PEG-PLGA particles have approximately 10-14% greater the anti-proliferative ability against CP70 and SKOV-3 cells at a concentration of 1.25 ?M, which falls within the concentrations used in chemotherapy. The proposed antibody-functionalization strategy represents an excellent platform for preparing particles with targeting ability in cancer therapy in vitro or in vivo.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681046","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.924931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"CD44","weight":0.818902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD44"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.723868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.679806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.648443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.634188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.483726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.450208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.343482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"},{"name":"Bradford protein assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_protein_assay"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Bacterial conjugation","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation"}]}
