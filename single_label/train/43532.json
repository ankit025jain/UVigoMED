{"id":43532,"title":"New hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs and the hope for a cure: concepts in anti-HCV drug development.","abstract":"The development of new models and tools has led to the discovery and clinical development of a large number of new anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs, including direct-acting antivirals and host-targeted agents. Surprisingly, curing HCV infection appears to be easy with these new drugs, provided that a potent drug combination with a high barrier to resistance is used. HCV infection cure rates can be optimized by combining drugs with synergistic antiviral effects, tailoring treatment duration to the patients' needs, and/or using ribavirin. Two HCV drugs have been approved in 2011--telaprevir and boceprevir, both first-wave, first-generation NS3-4A protease inhibitors, two others in 2013/2014--simeprevir, a second-wave, first-generation NS3-4A protease inhibitor, and sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of the viral polymerase. Numerous other drugs have reached phase II or III clinical development. From 2015 and onwards, interferon-containing regimens will disappear, replaced by interferon-free regimens yielding infection cure rates over 90%. These therapies will raise new issues, including the need for broad-scale screening and access to care.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782255","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.849453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.640761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Boceprevir","weight":0.61431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boceprevir"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"RNA polymerase","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.470812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.453533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.325994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.294221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.238548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
