{"id":34256,"title":"Genome-wide linkage analysis and association study identifies loci for polydactyly in chickens.","abstract":"Polydactyly occurs in some chicken breeds, but the molecular mechanism remains incompletely understood. Combined genome-wide linkage analysis and association study (GWAS) for chicken polydactyly helps identify loci or candidate genes for the trait and potentially provides further mechanistic understanding of this phenotype in chickens and perhaps other species. The linkage analysis and GWAS for polydactyly was conducted using an F2 population derived from Beijing-You chickens and commercial broilers. The results identified two QTLs through linkage analysis and seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) through GWAS, associated with the polydactyly trait. One QTL located at 35 cM on the GGA2 was significant at the 1% genome-wise level and another QTL at the 1% chromosome-wide significance level was detected at 39 cM on GGA19. A total of seven SNPs, four of 5% genome-wide significance (P < 2.98 × 10(-6)) and three of suggestive significance (5.96 × 10(-5)) were identified, including two SNPs (GGaluGA132178 and Gga_rs14135036) in the QTL on GGA2. Of the identified SNPs, the eight nearest genes were sonic hedgehog (SHH), limb region 1 homolog (mouse) (LMBR1), dipeptidyl-peptidase 6, transcript variant 3 (DPP6), thyroid-stimulating hormone, beta (TSHB), sal-like 4 (Drosophila) (SALL4), par-6 partitioning defective 6 homolog beta (Caenorhabditis elegans) (PARD6B), coenzyme Q5 (COQ5), and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, etapolypeptide (YWHAH). The GWAS supports earlier reports of the importance of SHH and LMBR1 as regulating genes for polydactyly in chickens and other species, and identified others, most of which have not previously been associated with limb development. The genes and associated SNPs revealed here provide detailed information for further exploring the molecular and developmental mechanisms underlying polydactyly.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752238","annotations":[{"name":"Caenorhabditis elegans","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"},{"name":"Drosophila","weight":0.848185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Alternative splicing","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing"},{"name":"Polydactyly","weight":0.767827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyly"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.664758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.564344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Sonic hedgehog","weight":0.509851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog"},{"name":"Centimorgan","weight":0.484545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimorgan"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.457338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.44088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.410876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Hedgehog","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog"},{"name":"Coenzyme Q10","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10"},{"name":"Genome-wide association study","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"F1 hybrid","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_hybrid"},{"name":"Caenorhabditis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Monooxygenase","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monooxygenase"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"}]}
