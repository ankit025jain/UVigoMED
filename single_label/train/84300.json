{"id":84300,"title":"Office-based screening of common psychiatric conditions.","abstract":"Depression and anxiety disorders are common conditions with significant morbidity. Many screening tools of varying length have been well validated for these conditions in the office-based setting. Novel instruments, including Internet-based and computerized adaptive testing, may be promising tools in the future. The best evidence for cost-effectiveness currently is for screening of major depression linked with the collaborative care model for treatment. Data are not conclusive regarding comparative cost-effectiveness of screening for multiple conditions at once or for other conditions. This article reviews screening tools for depression and anxiety disorders in the ambulatory setting.
