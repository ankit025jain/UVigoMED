{"id":67289,"title":"Full-thickness endometriosis of the bladder: report of 31 cases.","abstract":"To draw attention to the rare condition of endometriosis in the bladder. This is correlated with symptoms not normally connected to endometriosis and therefore often remains underdiagnosed for years.Retrospective study in a university teaching hospital, one of two referral centres in Denmark for surgical treatment of stage III and IV endometriosis.Thirty-one women with deep infiltrating bladder endometriosis.All women presenting in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology with deep infiltrating bladder endometriosis between March 2002 and March 2011. We included only patients with symptomatic full-thickness bladder detrusor endometriosis and mucosal involvement. All patients had had bladder symptoms for two to seven years.Symptoms after surgery and recurrence rate.The main preoperative symptom was urinary frequency. All patients had significant relief of symptoms after operation, and none had recurrence of the bladder endometriosis judged by ultrasound or reported symptoms. Twenty-six (87%) patients had endometriosis in another location as well. Eight had nodules in the recto-vaginal septum. Complete surgical excision of all associated endometriotic lesions was carried out during the same surgical procedure. During the mean follow-up period of 59 months no long-term complications were diagnosed.Bladder endometriosis should be considered in patients who present with irritative urological symptoms with aggravation during menstruation or in patients with a history of endometriosis. When patients have symptoms we recommend surgical treatment in cases where medical treatment fails.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630302","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Menstruation","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.717194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Obstetrics and gynaecology","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.625377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.546244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Detrusor urinae muscle","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrusor_urinae_muscle"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.289775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"University","weight":0.226367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frequent urination","weight":0.0162224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent_urination"},{"name":"Nasal septum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
