{"id":46889,"title":"Relevance of hepatoduodenal ligament lymph nodes in resectional surgery for gastric cancer.","abstract":"Hepatoduodenal lymph node (HDLN) positivity is considered distant metastasis in gastric cancer according to the seventh American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification. In contrast, the International Union Against Cancer seventh edition and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association both consider HDLN as a regional lymph node that can be included in the context of a curative resection. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was justification for considering HDLN involvement as a distant metastasis for which resectional surgery could not have survival benefit.This study enrolled consecutive patients with gastric cancer having D2 or greater resections, with removal and pathological assessment of the HDLN, between 1989 and 2009. The pathological stage of all patients was determined based on the seventh AJCC criteria, with HDLN included as a regional lymph node.A total of 1872 patients had their HDLN removed, of whom 68 had a metastatic lymph node in the hepatoduodenal ligament. The 5-year survival rate of these 68 patients was 30 per cent, compared with 47·7 per cent for those with stage III (P?<?0·001) and 9·8 per cent for those with stage IV (P?=?0·007) HDLN-negative tumours. The 5-year survival rate of 41 patients with HDLN metastasis and no evidence of distant metastasis at any other site was significantly higher than that among 120 patients with stage IV disease without HDLN metastasis (P?<?0·001), whereas 5-year survival did not differ between the 41 patients with stage I-III disease with HDLN metastasis and 568 patients with stage III tumours without HDLN metastasis (P?=?0·184). HDLN metastasis was not a significant factor for survival in multivariable analysis.It is inappropriate to include the HDLN in the distant metastatic lymph node group in gastric cancer. The seventh AJCC criteria for node grouping should be revised.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System
