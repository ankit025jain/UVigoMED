{"id":88903,"title":"The misleading appearance of silver nitrate on plain radiography.","abstract":"Cauterisation with silver nitrate is commonly used to treat overgranulation. Silver nitrate has a high density and a high mass attenuation coefficient, and it is therefore highly radio-opaque. We present a case in which its topical application to an area of overgranulation was interpreted as a bony fragment by the reporting radiologist in a patient with a supracondylar humeral fracture whose radiograph after removal of K-wires showed a large radio-opaque lesion. Although not a new phenomenon, it is one not widely known, and it can lead to confusion and unnecessary further imaging.
