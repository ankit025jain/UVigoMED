{"id":18248,"title":"[Impact of target energy intake on outcomes in septic patients : a prospective randomized controlled trial].","abstract":"To observe the impact of the diverse caloric energy intake on the outcomes and occurrence rate of complications in septic patients.A prospective single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted. 158 cases of septic patients in intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled and randomly assigned to three groups according to their different target value of nutrition: group A [measurements of resting energy expenditure ( MREE) <90% J , B ( MREE 90%-110%) and C ( MREE > 110%). The caloric intake, mechanical ventilation duration ( MVD),nosocomial infection rate, 28-day and 60-day mortality were analyzed.Daily energy intake in 7 days after ICU admission was as follows: the difference in target value of nutrition ( kJ/d: 7 075.0 ± 1 046.5, 5 667.8 ± 1 908.8,4 428.8 ± 1 377.8), calory intake ( k]/d: 4 671.6 ± 1 205.6, 5 655.3 ± 1 373.0, 6 053.0 ± 1 557.2), enteral nutrition value ( kJ/d: 2 051.1 ± 1 046.5, 3 980.9 ± 1 586.5, 5 337.1 ± 2 921.8) and average intake rate [ ( 66.0 ± 15.8 )% ,( 100.0 ± 5.7 )% , ( 134.0 ± 19.7)% J, and they were statistically significant difference among A, B, C groups (all P<0.05 ). The parenteral nutrition in group C were much higher than that in group A and group B ( kJ/d: 2 055.3 ± 273.4vs. 427.0 ± 273.4, 473.0 ± 332.0, both P<0.05 ). The calories provided by glucose and diprivan were similar among three groups. The MVD and ICU stay were shorter in group B than that in groups A and C [ MVD (days): 8.4 ± 6.3 vs.11.0 ± 8.2, 17.8 ± 13.0, P>0.05 and P<0.05; ICU stay (days): 11.0 ± 6.4 vs. 14.9 ± 9.6, 17.8 ± 13.0, respectively,P>0.05 and P<0.05]. The total hospital stay (days: 32.0 ± 22.5, 26.8 ± 7.0, 30.4 ± 21.4) and nosocomial infection rate [ 91.1% ( 51156) , 84.0% ( 42/50) , 90.4% ( 4 7/52) J were similar among A, B, C groups (all P>0.05). There was no difference in survival rate at 28 days among three groups as shown by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve ( F=3.145,P=0.076 ). The survival rate at 60 days showed a tendency of lowering in groups A and C, especially in group C (F=9.284, P=0.010).Both higher and lower caloric energy intake may be associated with an adverse impact, but appropriate caloric intake would improve the outcome and reduce the complication rate in septic patients.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
