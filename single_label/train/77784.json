{"id":77784,"title":"[Clinical analysis of ten cases of congenital middle ear cholesteatoma].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical features and operation treatment of the congenital middle ear cholesteatoma.A retrospective review of clinical and surgical records of 10 patients with congenital middle ear cholesteatoma were performed. All patients were treated by surgeries,5 of 10 cases deal with one-stage tympanoplasty after drum exploration by external auditory meatus, 3 cases dealed with closed mastoidotympanectomy and tympanomastoidectomy, 2 cases dealed with open mastoidotympanectomy and tympanomastoidectomy.The cholesteatomas were located at or around the posterior tympanum or mesotympanum in 5 patients, confined to the tympanic cavity and attic in 3 patients, advanced cholesteatoma that extended from the tympanic cavity into the mastoid antrum was seen in 2 patients. The mean postoperative PTA was 30 dB HL, the mean ABG was within 20 dB, after six months. No residual or recurrence of cholesteatoma was found.The congenital cholesteatoma often originates from the posterior or anterior of the middle ear, with hiding lesion, thus result in severe conductive hearing loss. Imaging examination plays an important role in diagnosing and treating of congenital cholesteatoma. Early stage surgical treatment can obtain a good hearing reconstruction effect.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026817","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Tympanic cavity","weight":0.853728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanic_cavity"},{"name":"Tympanoplasty","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanoplasty"},{"name":"Conductive hearing loss","weight":0.838067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Ear canal","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.715421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.583202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.171192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tensor tympani muscle","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Mastoid antrum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_antrum"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Drum","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
