{"id":56010,"title":"Cystoid macular edema: a correlation between macular volumetric parameters and visual acuity.","abstract":"To study in patients with cystoid macular edema (CME) the correlation between macular volumetric parameters on ocular coherence tomography (OCT) and visual acuity (VA).A retrospective consecutive cohort design was used.The sample included 167 examinations of 92 consecutive patients (130 eyes).Patients underwent spectral-domain OCT for CME from the years 2008 to 2010 at a tertiary medical centre. Background and VA data were recorded from the files. The custom-developed Cystometer software was used to calculate volumetric parameters from the OCT videos.In univariate analyses, VA correlated best with cystoid macular volume (CMVol; R(2) = 8.57) and total macular volume (TMV; R(2) = 7.46). By underlying disease, the strongest correlation was found with CMVol (R(2) = 8.47) in patients with diabetic CME (n = 91) and with TMV (R(2) = 22.18) in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (n = 46). In multiple regression analyses, TMV, age, and CMVol/TMV accounted for 17.57% of the variation in VA. In the diabetic CME group, CMVol/TMV and age accounted for 15.34% of the variation; in the branch retinal vein occlusion group, TMV accounted for 22.18% of the variation.Macular volumetric parameters measured by OCT and Cystometer software significantly correlate with VA in patients with CME, with variations by underlying CME causative factor.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye
