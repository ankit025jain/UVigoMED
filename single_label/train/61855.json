{"id":61855,"title":"Research on the roles of transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 in aplastic anemia.","abstract":"Aplastic anemia (AA) is a type of bone marrow hematopoietic system disease. The immune mediated hematopoietic inhibition is recognized as the most common pathogenesis of AA. However, the roles of the T-bet/GATA-3-mediated cell immune disorder in aplastic anemia (AA) is still unknown.Experimental samples were obtained from 27 patients with AA, including 15 cases of severe AA (SAA) and 12 cases of immune mediated AA (MAA), and 25 healthy volunteers (control group). The secretory levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 cytokines were determined by ELISA. The mRNA expression levels of transcription factors T-bet, GATA-3, and FoxP3 were measured in PBMCs by RT-PCR. Th1, Th2, and T lymphocyte subsets were detected in peripheral blood by flow cytometry.Compared to the healthy control group, the expression of T-bet mRNA and the percentage of Th1-type cells in the AA group significantly increased (p < 0.01), while the expression of GATA-3 and FoxP3 mRNA and the percentage of Th2-type cells decreased sharply (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Compared with MAA, the expression of T-bet mRNA and the percentage of Th1-type cells increased significantly in SAA (p < 0.01); meanwhile, the expression of GATA-3 mRNA and the proportion of Th2-type cells decreased noticeably (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Particularly, the percentage of CD3+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells in the AA group increased (p < 0.05), while the percentage of CD3+CD4+, CD4+CD25+, and CD4+CD8+ cells decreased (p < 0.05, p < 0.01).Abnormal expression of the transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 contributes to the imbalance of Thl/Th2 lymphocytes associated with immune dysfunction, leading to the development and progression of AA.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
