{"id":52487,"title":"Thoracic-to-hip circumference ratio as a novel marker of type 2 diabetes, independent of body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio, in Korean adults.","abstract":"We compared upper trunk anthropometric indices with overall and central obesity indicators to predict the presence of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged and elderly Korean individuals.This cross-sectional investigation included 4079 rural and urban participants aged 40-80 years. Neck, thoracic, waist (WC), and hip circumferences were measured by a reliable and standardized method. The neck-to-hip ratio, the thoracic-to-hip ratio (THR), and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Type 2 diabetes was defined based on the guidelines of the World Health Organization (1999).The receiver operator characteristic curve analysis indicated that THR and WHR were better than body mass index (BMI) and other anthropometric indices at predicting the presence of type 2 diabetes. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) across quartiles of THR were slightly higher than the ORs for WHR, particularly in the highest quartile (odds ratios and 95% CI: 2.11 (1.47-3.04) versus 1.95 (1.37-2.77) in men; 3.40 (2.18-5.31) versus 2.31 (1.48-3.60) in women). The associations of THR and WHR with type 2 diabetes remained significant, despite a slight attenuation after a multivariate adjustment for BMI. The joint effect of BMI and THR on the risk of type 2 diabetes was larger than that of BMI and WHR.THR may be a novel marker of type 2 diabetes, particularly in women, and its association with diabetes was independent of BMI and WHR.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598265","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.492685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.396419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.385244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.381468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.370166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.246439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.1188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Biomarker (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker_(medicine)"}]}
