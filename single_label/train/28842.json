{"id":28842,"title":"Problematic substance use among Hispanic adolescents and young adults: implications for prevention efforts.","abstract":"Using data collected between 2005 and 2012 from a longitudinal study of acculturation patterns and substance use among Hispanic youth in Southern California (N = 2722), we fit multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association of type and frequency of drug use, friend and parent drug use, cultural orientation (measured by the ARSMA-II), and psychological distress (CES-D score) in 10th grade with problematic substance use (measured with the RAPI) in (i) 11th grade and (ii) young adulthood. We conclude that future intervention efforts with Hispanic adolescents and young adults should target polysubstance and problem users and emphasize inter-individual, structural, and cultural processes as they relate to problematic substance use.
