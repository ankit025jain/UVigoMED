{"id":83272,"title":"[Quality of chronic patient care according to the Chronic Care Model inÂ Burkina Faso].","abstract":"There is a lack of organizational knowledge concerning optimal management by the health care system for patients with chronic health conditions in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to describe the quality of chronic patient care at first-line heath facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.We conducted a cross-sectional study in six health facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso from October to November 2013. The chronic care model was used as a reference to describe the care of hypertensive patients. A score was calculated for each item in the model, and the strengths and weaknesses of health care organization were identifiedThe overall level of support for the management of hypertensive patients was \"basic\" for all surveyed structures: median score and IQR 3.7 (3.4, 4.4). The level of support was basic for primary health facilities (median score 4.4), district hospitals (median score 4.1) and the University health center (median score 5.4). The relationship with the community and support to decision-making were identified as weak components of the model.To improve the quality of chronic patient care in first-line health facilities in Burkina Faso, efforts must be made to strengthen clinical governance and partnership with the community.","date":"2014-12-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25490230","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.440988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.419099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.323648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Burkina Faso","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Community health center","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_center"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Governance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Heath","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath"},{"name":"Clinical governance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_governance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Central reservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_reservation"},{"name":"Chronic care","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_care"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Organizational learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_learning"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
