{"id":88949,"title":"[Removal of osteosynthesis material in children and young people].","abstract":"Metallic osteosynthesis materials, i.e. implants used in the treatment of fractures and correction of bone position in children have traditionally been subsequently removed in a further operation. The necessity for the removal of orthopedic implants left completely under the skin is arguable and research-based evidence is scarce. Treatment practices vary. We present our literature- and experience-based recommendation on the removal of implants or leaving them in position. The removal of an implant should, however, always be decided on an individual basis.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772785","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.808582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.758308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.693966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.317447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.267972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Romanian literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_literature"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Necessity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
