{"id":68563,"title":"PSA nadir and outcome in 100 patients with pT3b prostate cancer.","abstract":"The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and long-term outcome in patients with pT3b prostate cancer were evaluated.From July 2000 to December 2012, in 100 patients (median age=62 years) with pT3b prostate cancer following radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) preoperative and pathological findings predictive of PSA nadir (?0.2 vs. >0.2 ng/ml) were retrospectively evaluated; moreover, biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), cancer specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in patients who underwent watchful waiting (16 cases), adjuvant (84 cases) and salvage (10 cases) therapy were recorded.A PSA nadir >0.2 ng/ml was correlated with node involvement, Gleason score ?9, cT2, PSA >20 ng/ml, positive surgical margins and total cancer percentage >20%. At a median follow-up of 90 months (range=10-155 months) bRFS, OS and CSS were 92%, 96% and 80%, respectively.Radical retropubic prostatectomy combined with adjuvant and salvage treatments demonstrated a satisfactory outcome for pT3b prostate cancer.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511036","annotations":[{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.882393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.837674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radical retropubic prostatectomy","weight":0.725677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_retropubic_prostatectomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.581328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.579228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.346269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.310685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Catalina Sky Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalina_Sky_Survey"},{"name":"Tesla (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Suggested retail price","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggested_retail_price"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
