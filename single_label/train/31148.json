{"id":31148,"title":"[Flagellate dermatitis after bleomycin chemotherapy in a patient with malignant germ cell tumor].","abstract":"A 49-year-old patient with malignant germ cell tumor within the first cycle PEB (platinum [P], etoposid [E] and bleomycin [B]) presented with an itchy linear papular erythema with discrete vesicles. The rash had appeared three days ago i.?e. four days after the second application of bleomycin.Visual diagnosis of a flagellate dermatitis.Primary treatment consisted of systemic antihistamines, local and systemic application of steroids. Bleomycin treatment was stopped and substituted by ifosfamide.Flagellate dermatitis occurs with an incidence up to 66?% after bleomycin treatment. There is no association between bleomycin dose and incidence or severity of the lesions. Flagellate dermatitis is a self-limiting condition but hyperpigmentation may persist. Similar lesions may occur with bendamustine and docetaxel, the intake of insufficiently cooked shiitake mushrooms as well as in dermatomyositis and Still's syndrome.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399654","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.95826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Ifosfamide","weight":0.951721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifosfamide"},{"name":"Germ cell tumor","weight":0.933194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell_tumor"},{"name":"Bleomycin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleomycin"},{"name":"Bendamustine","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendamustine"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.780386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Dermatomyositis","weight":0.750298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatomyositis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Histamine antagonist","weight":0.741097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_antagonist"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hyperpigmentation","weight":0.73481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpigmentation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.465911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.358033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.192037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.187499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Flagellate","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellate"},{"name":"Shiitake","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiitake"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mushroom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Cooking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"}]}
