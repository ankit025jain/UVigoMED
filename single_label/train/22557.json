{"id":22557,"title":"Mandatory infectious diseases approval of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT): clinical and economic outcomes of averted cases.","abstract":"The use of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been increasing worldwide due to its evident clinical utility; however, there is also concern about overuse and increased risk to patients in terms of antibiotic toxicity and intravenous line-associated complications. At our university-affiliated county teaching hospital with mandatory Infectious Diseases (ID) approval for all OPAT courses, we looked at clinical outcomes and cost savings of patients denied OPAT.Electronic medical records of patients denied OPAT were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic, medical, infection-specific and drug-specific data were collected for each patient, including the regimen ultimately recommended by ID in lieu of OPAT. Patients were determined to have clinical cure, probable cure or treatment failure based on resolution or recurrence of infection for up to 1 year after OPAT denial. The amount of money saved in direct OPAT costs in these patients was calculated.Fifty-six patients were denied OPAT during the study period and were discharged with either oral or no additional antibiotics. Clinical cure was documented in 42 patients (75%), probable cure in 7 patients (12.5%) and treatment failure in 7 patients (12.5%). Of the seven treatment failures, only one patient (1.8%) was deemed to be a true failure after thorough chart review. Overall, the estimated OPAT-specific cost saving was $215?424 or $3847 per patient.Mandatory ID approval of all OPAT courses can decrease healthcare costs while maintaining good clinical outcomes.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532684","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.619043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.524904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.343896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Electronic medical record","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.111615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Money","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0181577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"British Mandate for Palestine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Denial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"}]}
