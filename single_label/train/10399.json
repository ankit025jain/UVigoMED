{"id":10399,"title":"Optimised nanoformulation of bromocriptine for direct nose-to-brain delivery: biodistribution, pharmacokinetic and dopamine estimation by ultra-HPLC/mass spectrometry method.","abstract":"The present work evaluated whether the prepared nanoparticles (NPs) would be able to target the drug to the brain by a non-invasive nasal route enhancing its bioavailability.Bromocriptine (BRC) chitosan NPs (CS NPs) were prepared by ionic gelation method. The biodistribution, pharmacokinetic parameters and dopamine concentration was analysed by ultra-HPLC/mass spectrometry method. The histopathological examination in haloperidol-induced Parkinson's disease in mice model following intranasal (i.n.) administration was evaluated.BRC was found stable in all exposed conditions and the percentage accuracy observed for intra-day and inter-day batch samples ranged from 90.5 to 107% and 95.3 to 98.9% for plasma and brain homogenates, respectively. BRC-loaded CS NPs showed greater retention into the nostrils (42 ± 8.5% radioactivity) for about 4 h, whereas the 44 ± 7.5% could be retained up to 1 h for BRC solution. The brain:blood ratios of 0.96 ± 0.05 > 0.73 ± 0.15 > 0.25 ± 0.05 of BRC-loaded CS NPs (i.n.) > BRC solution (i.n.) > BRC-loaded CS NPs (intravenous), respectively, at 0.5 h indicated direct nose-to-brain transport bypassing blood-brain barrier. BRC-loaded CS NPs administered intranasally showed significantly high dopamine concentration (20.65 ± 1.08 ng/ml) as compared to haloperidol-treated mice (10.94 ± 2.16 ng/ml) (p < 0.05). Histopathology of brain sections showed selective degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in haloperidol-treated mice which was markedly reverted by BRC-loaded CS NPs.Nanoparticulate drug delivery system could be potentially used as a nose-to-brain drug delivery carrier for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655115","annotations":[{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.745867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Bromocriptine","weight":0.70277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromocriptine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.640761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.56282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.424516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.414101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.397972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Nostril","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Chitosan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitosan"},{"name":"Ionic bond","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bond"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"}]}
