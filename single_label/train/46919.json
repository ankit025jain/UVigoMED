{"id":46919,"title":"Tapasin modification on the intracellular epitope HBcAg18-27 enhances HBV-specific CTL immune response and inhibits hepatitis B virus replication in vivo.","abstract":"HBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity has a very important role in hepatitis B virus clearance. Present studies suggest that Tapasin, a endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, stabilizes the peptide-receptive MHC I conformation, allowing peptide exchange and increasing more peptides to be translocated into the ER. We have previously testified that cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP)-HBcAg(18-27)-Tapasin fusion protein could enter cytoplasm of dendritic cells, and enhance T cells' response to generate specific CTLs efficiently in vitro. In the present study, we evaluated specific immune responses of CTP-HBcAg(18-27)-Tapasin fusion protein in HLA-A2 transgenic mice (H-2K(b)) and anti-viral ability in HBV transgenic mice, and explored the mechanisms probably involved in. The studies showed that CTP-HBcAg(18-27)-Tapasin not only increased production of cytokine IFN-? and interleukin-2 (IL-2), compared with CTP-HBcAg(18-27), HBcAg(18-27)-Tapasin, and PBS, but also significantly induced the higher percentages of IFN-?+CD8(+) T cells and specific CTL responses in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Moreover, enhancement of specific CTL activity induced by the fusion protein reduced HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels and decreased the expression of HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in liver tissue of HBV transgenic mice. In addition, CTP-HBcAg(18-27)-Tapasin could upregulate the expression of JAK2, Tyk2, STAT1, and STAT4 in T lymphocytes in HLA-A2 transgenic mice splenocytes. However, there was no significant difference on the expressions of JAK1, JAK3, and STAT6 between each group. In conclusion, CTP-HBcAg(18-27)-Tapasin fusion protein could enhance not only the percentages of CTLs but also induce robust specific CTL activity and inhibits hepatitis B virus replication in vivo, which was associated with activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System
