{"id":45743,"title":"Perioperative systemic chemotherapy in peritoneal carcinomatosis of lymph node positive colorectal cancer treated with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.","abstract":"Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) is the preferred treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of colorectal carcinoma. Patients with positive lymph node status have worse survival after CRS-HIPEC, which is probably due to higher rates of systemic failure. In this study, we analysed the effect of administration and timing of systemic chemotherapy on the outcome of lymph node positive colorectal carcinoma patients treated with CRS-HIPEC.A prospective database was reviewed to identify lymph node positive patients with PC treated with CRS-HIPEC within 1 year after primary tumour diagnosis between 2004 and 2012. Medical history of the patients was studied for the administration of perioperative systemic chemotherapy and follow-up. Outcome parameters were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and pattern of recurrence.Seventy-three patients treated with CRS-HIPEC for PC from lymph node positive colorectal carcinoma were identified. Fourteen patients received pre-CRS-HIPEC chemotherapy only, 32 patients underwent post-CRS-HIPEC chemotherapy only, 9 patients received chemotherapy both pre- and post-CRS-HIPEC and 16 patients did not receive any systemic chemotherapy. Of the 47 patients who did not receive pre-CRS-HIPEC chemotherapy, 11 (23%) did not receive any chemotherapy due to major postoperative complications. PFS and OS were significantly higher in patients who received systemic chemotherapy (PFS: median 15 versus 4 months, P = 0.024; OS: median 30 versus 14 months, P = 0.015), although this difference was attenuated after adjustment for major complications. Different chemotherapy timings did not differ significantly in either survival or recurrence patterns.In patients with PC from lymph node positive colorectal carcinoma, perioperative systemic chemotherapy is associated with increased OS and PFS, although this difference may be partly explained by the occurrence of major postoperative complication; with no evidence of difference in PFS, OS and systemic recurrence rate by timing of systemic chemotherapy.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667719","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.613322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.552214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Carcinosis","weight":0.48132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinosis"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.466275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.385378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.3191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.196227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.15402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Timing (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_(music)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
