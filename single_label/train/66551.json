{"id":66551,"title":"Impact of bladder cancer on health related quality of life in 1,476 older Americans: a cross-sectional study.","abstract":"The impact of bladder cancer diagnosis on health related quality of life is poorly understood. We compared health related quality of life measures in patients before and after bladder cancer diagnosis.We performed a cross-sectional study in 1,476 patients 65 years old or older with bladder cancer in the SEER-MHOS linkage database between 1998 and 2007 to assess differences in physical and mental component summary scores in 620 and 856 who completed a survey before and after bladder cancer diagnosis, respectively. To determine differences in physical and mental scores in the prediagnosis and post-diagnosis cohorts, we used ANOVA adjusting for baseline covariates.There were statistically significant differences in physical and mental component summary scores between the prediagnosis and post-diagnosis groups (-2.7, 95% CI -3.8, -1.7 vs -1.4, 95% CI -2.6, -0.3). In patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer the physical and mental score differences were -1.9 (p <0.01) and -1.4 (p = 0.01), respectively. In those with muscle invasive bladder cancer there was a statistically and clinically significant difference in the physical but not the mental score (-5.3, p <0.01 vs -2.7, p = 0.07). This difference in the physical domain persisted up to 10 years after the diagnosis of muscle invasive bladder cancer. Patients with bladder cancer who had 4 or more comorbid medical conditions and 1 or more deficits in daily living activity were most at risk for low physical component summary scores.Future research into interventions to improve health related quality of life and methods to incorporate health related quality of life into decision making models are critical to improve outcomes in older patients with bladder cancer.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704007","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.671318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.556894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.497222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.420226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.396656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.22245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"476","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/476"},{"name":"856","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/856"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Incorporation (business)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Balance of trade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
