{"id":92169,"title":"Grid pattern delivered to the cornea during femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery.","abstract":"A 63-year-old patient had cataract surgery in the left eye performed using the femtosecond laser. The laser successfully created the capsulotomy, but as the femtosecond lens fragmentation was being performed, the patient suddenly moved and the eye disengaged from the patient interface. As this happened, the surgeon stopped the treatment, but inspection of the cornea revealed a partial lens fragmentation grid pattern in the temporal cornea. This inadvertent occurrence did not affect the final surgical result.Dr. Yoo is a consultant to Abbott Medical Optics, Inc.
