{"id":91873,"title":"Breast cancer and osteoporosis.","abstract":"Over the past few years, a number of studies have examined the relationship between breast cancer and osteoporosis, the effect of breast cancer treatment on bone health, and the effect of osteoporosis therapies on aromatase inhibitor-induced bone loss and breast cancer recurrence. New guidelines have been released on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in women with breast cancer who are on aromatase inhibitors for adjuvant therapy.Despite common factors linking high bone mineral density and increased risk of breast cancer, women with breast cancer are not protected from osteoporosis or osteoporotic fractures. Recent data suggest that aromatase inhibitors have a detrimental effect on bone mineral density and can increase the risk of fractures. Bisphosphonate therapy not only preserves aromatase inhibitor-induced bone loss, but may also improve disease-free survival and decrease risk of death in select women with breast cancer (i.e., postmenopausal women).Osteoporosis and breast cancer are common in women, especially in postmenopausal women. Current guidelines suggest that we need to pay special attention to those on aromatase inhibitors to prevent adverse bone outcomes.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468755","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Aromatase inhibitor","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.743951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.735552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.552802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.52768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.510815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.324648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.214973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Postmenopausal","weight":0.0983486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmenopausal"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Breast cancer treatment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_treatment"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
