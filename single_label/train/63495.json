{"id":63495,"title":"Treatment of indolent primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas with subcutaneous interferon-alfa.","abstract":"Interferon-alfa is used in the treatment of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (PCBCL). Therapy with interferon-alfa has thus far been reported solely in case reports and small case series, mostly describing intralesional use.We sought to evaluate efficacy, response rate, time to response, duration of response, and safety of subcutaneously administered interferon-alfa for the treatment of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.We conducted a retrospective chart analysis of patients given the diagnosis of PCBCL and treated with interferon-alfa subcutaneously at a tertiary referral center.Fifteen patients with indolent subtypes of PCBCL were identified. The overall response rate was 66.7%; all responding patients went into complete remission. Response was not significantly associated with the maximum tolerated dose. Within the median follow-up time of 40 months, 90% of the responders experienced a relapse; median duration of response was 15.5 months. Adverse events were predominantly mild and in no case led to cessation of therapy.Retrospective nature of the analysis and small number of patients because of scarcity of the disease are limitations.Treatment of indolent PCBCL with subcutaneously injected interferon-alfa demonstrated good response rates and tolerability. Response was not dose dependent. Relapses were observed in nearly all responding patients raising the question of interferon-alfa maintenance therapy in PCBCL.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433874","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.800857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.508151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.498588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.26931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.260052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Maximum tolerated dose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_tolerated_dose"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Scarcity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity"}]}
