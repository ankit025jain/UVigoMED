{"id":28750,"title":"How common are drug and gene interactions? Prevalence in a sample of 1143 patients with CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotyping.","abstract":"Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a widely recognized major cause of adverse drug reactions, but two other newly described important types of interactions also exist: drug-gene interactions (DGIs) and drug-drug-gene interactions (DDGIs). A drug-gene interaction occurs when a patient's genetic CYP450 type (e.g., CYP2D6 poor metabolizer) affects that patient's ability to clear a drug. A drug-drug-gene interaction occurs when the patient's CYP450 genotype and another drug in the patient's regimen (e.g., a CYP2D6 inhibitor) affect that individual's ability to clear a drug. Their prevalence has not been previously described. This pilot study investigates the frequency of DDIs, DGIs and DDGIs in a sample of CYP450 tested individuals.The investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of 1143 individuals with known CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 genotypes. Using the individuals' medication lists and YouScript(Â®), a software tool to analyze cumulative DDIs and DGIs, the prevalence of DDI, DGI and DDGIs was analyzed.A total of 1053 potential major or substantial interactions were identified in 501 individuals. DDIs accounted for 66.1% of the total interactions. The remaining 33.9% of interactions were DGIs (14.7%) and DDGIs (19.2%). When compared with DDIs alone, DGIs and DDGIs increased the total number of potentially clinically significant interactions by 51.3%.In the future, identifying DGIs and DDGIs may lead to a more comprehensive method of identifying individuals who are at risk for adverse drug reactions.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798722","annotations":[{"name":"CYP2D6","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6"},{"name":"CYP2C19","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2C19"},{"name":"CYP2C9","weight":0.869543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2C9"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.813654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.789718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.599158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"1143","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1143"},{"name":"1053","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1053"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Intelligence Directorate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Directorate"},{"name":"Scientific pitch notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Device driver","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
