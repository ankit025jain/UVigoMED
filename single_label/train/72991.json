{"id":72991,"title":"Identification of patients at very low risk of local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery.","abstract":"To identify clinical and pathological factors that identify groups of women with stage I breast cancer with a 5-year risk of local recurrence (LR) ?1.5% after breast-conserving therapy (BCS) plus whole-breast radiation therapy (RT).Study subjects were 5974 patients ?50 years of age whose cancer was diagnosed between 1989 and 2006, and were referred with pT1 pN0 invasive breast cancer treated with BCS and RT. Cases of 5- and 10-year LR were examined using Kaplan-Meier methods. Recursive partitioning analysis was performed in patients treated with and without endocrine therapy to identify combinations of factors associated with a 5-year LR risk ?1.5%.The median follow-up was 8.61 years. Median age was 63 years of age (range, 50 to 91). Overall 5-year LR was 1.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2%-1.9%) and 10-year LR was 3.4% (95% CI, 2.8%-4.0%). Of 2830 patients treated with endocrine therapy, patient subsets identified with 5-year LR ?1.5% included patients with grade 1 histology (n=1038; LR, 0.2%; 95% CI, 0%-0.5%) or grade 2 histology plus ?60 years of age (n=843; LR, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0%-1.0%). Ten-year LR for these groups were 0.8% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.6%) and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.6%), respectively. Of 3144 patients treated without endocrine therapy, patients with grade 1 histology plus clear margins had 5-year LR ?1.5% (n=821; LR, 0.6%; 95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%). Ten-year LR for this group was 2.2% (95% CI, 1.0%-3.4%).Histologic grade, age, margin status, and use of endocrine therapy identified 45% of a population-based cohort of female patients over age 50 with stage I breast cancer with a 5-year LR risk ?1.5% after BCS plus RT. Prospective study is needed to evaluate the safety of omitting RT in patients with such a low risk of LR.","date":"2014-06-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929165","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.662436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.606934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.586821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.569809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.477312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.393353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Tesla (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"},{"name":"Recursive partitioning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_partitioning"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1989","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989"},{"name":"821","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/821"},{"name":"843","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/843"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"1038","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1038"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Second grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_grade"},{"name":"First grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_grade"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Newton (unit)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Bowl Championship Series","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series"}]}
