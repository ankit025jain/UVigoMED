{"id":35947,"title":"Total hip arthroplasty for Crowe IV hip without subtrochanteric shortening osteotomy -a long term follow up study.","abstract":"Several authors reported encouraging results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) for Crowe IV hips performed using shortening osteotomy. However, few papers have documanted the results of THA for Crowe IV hips without shortening osteotomy. The aim of the present study was to assess the long term-results of cemented THAs for Crowe group IV hips performed without subtrochanteric shortening osteotomy.We have assessed the long term results of 27 cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed without subtrochanteric osteotomy for Crowe group IV hip. All THAs were performed via transtrochanteric approach.After a mean follow-up of 10.6 (6 to 17.9) years, 25 hips (92.6%) had survived without revision surgery and survivorship analysis gave a survival rate of 96.3% at 10 years with any revision surgery as the end point. Although mean limb lengthening was 3.2 (1.0 to 5.1) cm, no hips developed nerve palsy. Complications occurred in four hips, necessitating revision surgery in two. Among the four complications, three involved the greater trochanter, two of which occurred in cases where braided cables had been used to reattach the greater trochanter.Although we encountered four complications, including three trochanteric problems, our findings suggest that THA without subtrochanteric shortening osteotomy can provide satisfactory long-term results in patients with Crowe IV hip.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612470","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Distraction osteogenesis","weight":0.442203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction_osteogenesis"},{"name":"Greater trochanter","weight":0.392002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_trochanter"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.385448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.376152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.299112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.227918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Cable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable"},{"name":"Braided river","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braided_river"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Concurrent estate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
