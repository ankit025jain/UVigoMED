{"id":74138,"title":"Likelihood of bone recurrence in prior sites of metastasis in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.","abstract":"Despite recent improvements in outcomes, 40% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma will experience relapse, facing a guarded prognosis for long-term cure. Whether recurrences are at new sites or sites of original disease may guide decision making during initial therapy.Eligible patients were retrospectively identified from institutional databases at first metastatic relapse of high-risk neuroblastoma. Included patients had disease involving metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)-avid metastatic sites at diagnosis and first relapse, achieved a complete or partial response with no more than one residual MIBG-avid site before first relapse, and received no total body irradiation or therapy with (131)I-MIBG before first relapse. Anatomically defined metastatic sites were tracked from diagnosis through first relapse to determine tendency of disease to recur at previously involved versus uninvolved sites and to assess whether this pattern was influenced by site irradiation.Of 159 MIBG-avid metastatic sites identified among 43 patients at first relapse, 131 (82.4%) overlapped anatomically with the set of 525 sites present at diagnosis. This distribution was similar for bone sites, but patterns of relapse were more varied for the smaller subset of soft tissue metastases. Among all metastatic sites at diagnosis in our subsequently relapsed patient cohort, only 3 of 19 irradiated sites (15.8%) recurred as compared with 128 of 506 (25.3%) unirradiated sites.Metastatic bone relapse in neuroblastoma usually occurs at anatomic sites of previous disease. Metastatic sites identified at diagnosis that did not receive radiation during frontline therapy appeared to have a higher risk of involvement at first relapse relative to previously irradiated metastatic sites. These observations support the current paradigm of irradiating metastases that persist after induction chemotherapy in high-risk patients. Furthermore, they raise the hypothesis that metastatic sites appearing to clear with induction chemotherapy may also benefit from radiotherapeutic treatment modalities (external beam radiation or (131)I-MIBG).","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867534","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.348303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Total body irradiation","weight":0.308691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_body_irradiation"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.212081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.18647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.165536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Iobenguane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iobenguane"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"}]}
