{"id":66533,"title":"Antioxidant cosupplementation therapy with vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10 in patients with oligoasthenozoospermia.","abstract":"Overproduction of reactive oxygen species results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that damages cell structure as well as lipids, proteins, and DNA. Oxidative stress plays a major role in various human diseases, such as oligoasthenozoospermia syndrome.We evaluated the effectiveness of antioxidant co-supplementation therapy using vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10 in men with oligoasthenozoospermia. Overall, 169 infertile men with oligoasthenozoospermia received antioxidant therapy with 80 mg/day vitamin C, 40 mg/day vitamin E, and 120 mg/day coenzyme Q10. We evaluated spermiogram parameters at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.Significant improvements were evident in sperm concentration and motility following coenzyme Q10 therapy. Treatment resulted in 48 (28.4%) partner pregnancies, of which 16 (9.5%) were spontaneous. Significant improvements in sperm cell concentration and sperm motility were observed after 3 and 6 months of treatment.Vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10 supplementation resulted in a significant improvement in certain semen parameters. However, further studies are needed to empirically determine the effect of supplementation on pregnancy rate.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704922","annotations":[{"name":"Coenzyme Q10","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.64973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.571178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.188159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Sperm motility","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_motility"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"}]}
