{"id":56022,"title":"The primary eye care examination: opening the case history and the patient's uninterrupted initial talking time.","abstract":"The uninterrupted initial talking time (UITT) of optometric patients was measured in response to the clinician's opening question: \"Do you have any problems with your eyes or your sight?\"UITT was measured surreptitiously by the optometrist. Also noted was whether an eye/sight problem was claimed by the patient and whether or not this was subsequently confirmed by the examination.Data were collected from 822 adults, mean age 59.1yrs (SD 17.6), range 16.0-92.0yrs. UITT data were positively skewed; median value 28.87s (IQR 19.81-43.03s) and no statistically significant difference between genders (p=0.9). 53% of patients had completed their opening statement by 30s, and 90% after 1min. 75% of these individuals (age range 26-75yrs) had a median UITT 27.82s; younger patients (16-25yrs) spoke for a significantly shorter time (18.39s: p=0.002) and elderly patients (?76yrs) a significantly longer time (37.27s: p=0.003) than the majority value. Previously unexamined patients, habitual spectacle wearers, and individuals presenting with an eye/sight problem all recorded a significantly longer UITT (p?0.006) than their peers. The practitioner's opening question had a sensitivity of 0.54/specificity of 0.95, and a positive predictive value (PV) of 0.78/negative PV of 0.87: with a calculated value of ?=0.53, the strength of agreement between subjective claim and objective outcome could be regarded as 'moderate'.These data suggest that an optometric patient's UITT of <30s is unlikely to prove disruptive to the clinical routine.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766864","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.587823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.381463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.348654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.22583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Skewness","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"1625","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1625"},{"name":"822","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/822"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"27th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_century_BC"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Real estate pricing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_pricing"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Opening statement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
