{"id":91561,"title":"The microvasculature in the equine distal phalanx: implications for fracture healing.","abstract":"To describe the intra-osseous microvasculature of the distal phalanx of the equine forelimb with regard to its potential clinical relevance.Eleven clinically normal equine forelimbs were used from six adult horses (range: 4 to 18 years old) euthanatized for reasons unrelated to lameness. In each limb the median artery was catheterized at the level of the carpus and India ink was injected under constant manual pressure. The limbs were frozen and 5 mm thick sections of the foot were cut in the sagittal, coronal, or transverse planes on a band saw. The sections were fixed in 10% formalin and cleared using a modified Spalteholz technique. Once cleared, the sections were photographed and the microvascular anatomy identified.The vascular injections revealed a rich intra-osseous microvascular supply of the distal phalanx originating from the medial and lateral palmar digital arteries. In addition, numerous smaller vessels from the terminal arch, formed by anastomosis of the medial and lateral palmar digital arteries, could be seen branching into the distal aspects of the distal phalanx. This distal portion of the distal phalanx appeared more densely vascularized than the proximal part in all specimens examined.The increased vascularity demonstrated in the distal portion of the distal phalanx appears to correlate with improved fracture healing reported in this area. This may also explain why healing fractures which involve both the distal and proximal portions of the distal phalanx have been described as progressing from distal-to-proximal.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24493320","annotations":[{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.775864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.764089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.749529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.687199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Phalanx bone","weight":0.643438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.620382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.589761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.574643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Distal phalanges","weight":0.517995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_phalanges"},{"name":"India","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.41286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.307663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Forelimb","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forelimb"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"India ink","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_ink"},{"name":"Equus (genus)","weight":0.0203168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(genus)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Ink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Lameness (equine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lameness_(equine)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
