{"id":30924,"title":"Bupropion as an add-on therapy in depressed bipolar disorder type I patients with comorbid cocaine dependence.","abstract":"The treatment of bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) with a comorbid cocaine dependence disorder (CDD) is a challenge in current psychiatric practice. Drugs with proven efficacy in manic/mixed episodes, such as atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, sometimes do not prevent depressive relapses; on the other hand, the use of antidepressants during acute depressive episodes may increase the risk of a manic switch. The aim of the present study was to investigate the short-term efficacy of bupropion augmentation in acutely depressed BD-I patients with co-occurring CDD.Twelve depressed BD-I patients, with a comorbid CDD, treated with valproate 1000 to 1500 mg/d and aripiprazole 10 mg/d, were randomly assigned to receive bupropion 150 mg/d as an open-label add-on therapy (n = 5) or to continue their previous treatment (n = 7).After 4 weeks of observation, patients receiving add-on therapy with bupropion have improved in terms of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and Drug Abuse Screening Test scores, with respect to those of the comparison group, whereas no significant increase of Young Mania Rating Scale scores over time was observed.Our preliminary findings suggest that combining bupropion with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics may be a good therapeutic option in short-term treatment of depressed BD-I patients with comorbid CDD.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434527","annotations":[{"name":"Aripiprazole","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole"},{"name":"Bupropion","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.876215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression","weight":0.817494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Rating_Scale_for_Depression"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Valproic acid","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproic_acid"},{"name":"Young Mania Rating Scale","weight":0.785117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Mania_Rating_Scale"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mania","weight":0.734292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania"},{"name":"Atypical antipsychotic","weight":0.727753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Mood stabilizer","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_stabilizer"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.634618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.605038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.586078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.458832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Augmentation (psychiatry)","weight":0.292974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.229335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cocaine dependence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_dependence"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
