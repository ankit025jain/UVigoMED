{"id":9844,"title":"Antiinflammatory activity of glucomoringin isothiocyanate in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.","abstract":"Glucomoringin (4(?-L-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl glucosinolate) (GMG) is an uncommon member of glucosinolate group belonging to the Moringaceae family, of which Moringa oleifera Lam. is the most widely distributed. Bioactivation of GMG with the enzyme myrosinase forms the corresponding isothiocyanate (4(?-L-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate) (GMG-ITC), which can play a key role in antitumoral activity and counteract the inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of GMG-ITC treatment in an experimental mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory demyelinating disease with neurodegeneration characterized by demyelinating plaques, neuronal, and axonal loss. For this reason, C57Bl/6 male mice were injected with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein35-55 which is able to evoke an autoimmune response against myelin fibers miming human multiple sclerosis physiopatogenesis. Results clearly showed that the treatment was able to counteract the inflammatory cascade that underlies the processes leading to severe MS. In particular, GMG-ITC was effective against proinflammatory cytokine TNF-?. Oxidative species generation including the influence of iNOS, nitrotyrosine tissue expression and cell apoptotic death pathway was also evaluated resulting in a lower Bax/Bcl-2 unbalance. Taken together, this work adds new interesting properties and applicability of GMG-ITC and this compound can be suggested as a useful drug for the treatment or prevention of MS, at least in association with current conventional therapy.
