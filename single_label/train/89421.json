The concept of fracture risk, the inclusion of fracture risk in clinical practice guidelines for osteoporosis, and how fracture risk has contributed to the development of postfracture secondary prevention programs are described. The scope of postfracture secondary prevention programs, the gaps in care that persist despite these initiatives, and the potential reasons for these gaps are also described. Recommendations for future research in the area of postfracture secondary prevention are provided.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721371","annotations":[{"name":"Research","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"}]}
