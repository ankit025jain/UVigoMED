The case notes were retrieved from the hospital's Records Department and information on socio-demographic characteristics, age, and parity, clinical presentation, findings at laparotomy, estimated blood loss and the need for blood transfusion were obtained. Data were entered into SPSS 17.0 and analysed descriptively.There were 382 cases of ectopic gestations out of the total 9880 total deliveries within the study period. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy was 38.66 per 1,000 live births or I in 26 deliveries. Nulliparous women were 132 (34.5%). At presentation, 99.47% of patients had rupture with haemoperitoneum, with the commonest site being the ampulla of the fallopian tube as seen in 338 (88.4%). Salpingectomy was done in majority of cases, accounting for 355 (93%), while 248 (65%) had blood transfusion. Five (1.3%) maternal deaths occurred during period of study.Ectopic pregnancy presents a major public health challenge among women of reproductive age groups in Nigeria.
