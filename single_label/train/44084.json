{"id":44084,"title":"[Association between CISH polymorphisms and susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B in Chinese Han population].","abstract":"To investigate the association between rs414171 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of cytokine- inducible src homology 2 domain protein (CISH) and the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B.A total of 233 Chinese Han patients with chronic hepatitis B and 148 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study. The SNP rs414171 was genotyped by Sequenom MassArray-IPLEX to analyze the relationship between rs414171 and chronic hepatitis B.The distribution of SNP rs414171 allele and genotype frequencies showed no significant difference between the patients and healthy controls (P>0.05).CISH rs414171 is not significantly associated with the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B in Chinese Han population.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752089","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.86985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.74572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.471526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.29681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.262737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.147826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Sequenom","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequenom"},{"name":"Genotype frequency","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype_frequency"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"233 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/233_(number)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"}]}
