{"id":81903,"title":"Bilateral eruption cysts associated with primary molars in both the jaws.","abstract":"Disturbances of tooth development may result in anomalies which appear in the form of swelling of the overlying mucosa of the erupting deciduous or permanent teeth, mostly in children. Eruption cyst (EC), a benign cyst is one such lesion associated with erupting teeth. ECs usually present as solitary swellings on the alveolar ridge mucosa, whereas multiple ECs presenting simultaneously or in short intervals are unusual. Here, we present a rare case of four large bilateral ECs presenting with swellings and pain in the posterior region of each quadrant in the mouth. The treatment included surgical excision under general anaesthesia and exposure of the unerupted primary teeth.
