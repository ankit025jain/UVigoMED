{"id":37567,"title":"Setleis syndrome: genetic and clinical findings in a new case with epilepsy.","abstract":"Focal facial dermal dysplasias are a group of inherited ectodermal disorders characterized by congenital bitemporal or periauricular scar-like depressions as well as other facial and nonfacial developmental defects. Four subtypes have been delineated, and mutations in the TWIST2 gene have been identified in type III focal facial dermal dysplasia (Setleis syndrome).We describe a sporadic patient with the hallmark bitemporal scar-like lesions, severe intellectual disability, and focal epilepsy.The boy has typical features of Setleis syndrome, and he developed focal epilepsy, a previously unreported feature of this syndrome. No mutations in the TWIST2 gene were found, and there were no pathologic copy number abnormalities.Epilepsy could represent a new manifestation, and the patient described broadens the spectrum of clinical features associated with Setleis syndrome, including central nervous system involvement.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486222","annotations":[{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.732642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ectoderm","weight":0.64065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.568502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.531039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.513047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.468345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.28781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0459474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"}]}
