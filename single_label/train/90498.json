{"id":90498,"title":"Mortality following the first hip fracture in Norwegian women and men (1999-2008). A NOREPOS study.","abstract":"Hip fractures are associated with increased mortality and their incidence in Norway is one of the highest worldwide. The aim of this nationwide study was to examine short- and long-term mortality after hip fractures, burden of disease (attributable fraction and potential years of life lost), and time trends in mortality compared to the total Norwegian population. Information on incident hip fractures between 1999 and 2008 in all persons aged 50 years and older was collected from Norwegian hospitals. Death and emigration dates of the hip fracture patients were obtained through 31 December 2010. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and Poisson regression analyses were used for the estimation of time trends in SMRs. Among the 81,867 patients with a first hip fracture, the 1-year excess mortality was 4.6-fold higher in men, and 2.8-fold higher in women compared to the general population. Although the highest excess mortality was observed during the first two weeks post fracture, the excess risk persisted for twelve years. Mortality rates post hip fracture were higher in men compared to women in all age groups studied. In both genders aged 50 years and older, approximately 5% of the total mortality in the population was related to hip fractures. The largest proportion of the potential life-years lost was in the relatively young-old, i.e. less than 80 years. In men, the 1-year absolute mortality rates post hip fracture declined significantly between 1999 and 2008, by contrast, the mortality in women increased significantly relatively to the population mortality.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607943","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.354129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.248181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.123553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Emigration","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"867","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Autocracy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Faster-than-light","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"}]}
