{"id":71856,"title":"Verrucarin A alters cell-cycle regulatory proteins and induces apoptosis through reactive oxygen species-dependent p38MAPK activation in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.","abstract":"Verrucarin A (VA), an active constituent of pathogenic fungus Myrothecium verrucaria, which has the ability to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which VA exerts its inhibitory potential remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that VA inhibited the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and subsequently induced mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) loss, leading to the increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, PARP degradation, and apoptosis. VA effectively increased the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and diminished the phosphorylation of ERK/Akt. In addition, VA caused cell cycle deregulation through the induction of p21 and p53. Furthermore, ROS scavenger (n-acetyl-L-cysteine) and p38MAPK inhibitor (SB202190) effectively abrogated the VA-induced cell cycle deregulation and apoptosis. Conversely, U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, enhanced the VA-induced apoptotic signals. Taken together, our results suggest that VA-induces apoptosis and cell cycle deregulation in MCF-7 cells through ROS-dependent p38MAPK activation.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25027398","annotations":[{"name":"P53","weight":0.862818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cytochrome c","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.734059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.682824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.668418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.632187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.531511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.521942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.450656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.442603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.329805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"DNA-binding protein","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA-binding_protein"},{"name":"Active ingredient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"},{"name":"Scavenger (chemistry)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Million","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Bachelor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"}]}
