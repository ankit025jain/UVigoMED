{"id":11294,"title":"Indole and trans-chalcone attenuate amyloid ? plaque accumulation in male Wistar rat: in vivo effectiveness of two anti-amyloid scaffolds.","abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative condition in which abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques is observed, and for which no effective treatment still exist. In recent years, many aromatic small molecules have been observed to have anti-amyloid effect, and may have the potential to attenuate AD symptoms. The indole core and the flavonoid precursor trans-chalcone have been studied here as representative of these group of molecules. Formation of amyloid plaques has been induced in a rat model of AD, after what the two compounds were given to experimental groups. Shuttle box experiment and histological examination of brain amyloid plaques was then performed in order to test the effect of 28 days treatment on rats memory and brain tissue integrity. In conclusion, it was found that both compounds were effective in ameliorating the rats condition, and could be considered as interesting potential drug candidates.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599628","annotations":[{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.562222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Indole","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.343471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.300387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.288801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.138079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Small molecule","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Wistar rat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wistar_rat"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Space Shuttle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
