{"id":65629,"title":"Comparison of clinicopathologic characteristics of urothelial carcinoma between patients after renal transplantation and on dialysis.","abstract":"Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a common complication after renal replacement therapy (RRT) among Chinese end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. It is unclear whether there are any differences in the clinicopathologic characteristics of UC between renal transplantation (RT) and dialysis patients; such differences could impact RRT modality selection.We retrospectively reviewed clinicopathologic data for 27 RT patients and 40 dialysis patients who were diagnosed with UC in our center to explore differences in the clinicopathologic characteristics of UC and prognoses between the two groups.The median follow-up period was 92 months (2-137) for the RT group and 71 months (18-155) for the dialysis group. The demographic and baseline data showed no significant differences between the two groups. Upper urinary tract UC (UUC) occurred more frequently in the RT group (22 UUCs in 39 UCs), whereas bladder UC (BUC) predominated in the dialysis group (33 BUCs in 49 UCs) (P=0.025). The pathologic grading in the RT group was significantly higher than that in the dialysis group (P=0.046 for WHO1973 grading, P=0.026 for WHO2004 grading), whereas the difference in tumor stage was not significant (P=0.089). The RT group manifested a higher recurrence rate than the dialysis group (P=0.024). However, the overall and cancer-specific survival rates between the two groups were not significantly different (P=0.239 and P=0.818, respectively).Certain traits of UC, including tumor site, pathologic grading, and recurrence-free survival, were notably different between RT and dialysis patients, but the overall and cancer-specific survival rates were similar.","date":"2014-08-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798310","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.593046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.500975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.389231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}]}
