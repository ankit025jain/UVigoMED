{"id":44752,"title":"Prognostic factors of distal cholangiocarcinoma after curative surgery: a series of 84 cases.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to identify useful prognostic factors for patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma.The records of 84 patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Potential clinicopathological prognostic factors that may affect survival were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses.There were two patients died within 30 days of surgery. Overall survival rates were 69.51%, 42.68%, and 36.59% for 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively (median survival time, 32.74 months). Univariate analysis found that alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio less than and equal to 2, serum bilirubin less than and equal to 171 micromol/L, CA19-9 level less than 150 U/L, tumor size less than 2 cm, absent neural invasion, and absent lymph node involvement were associated with higher survival rate (p < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariate analysis found that AST/ALT ratio more than 2, present lymph node involvement and present neural invasion were the independent risk factors of poor survival (p < 0.01).These results suggest that not only the well-known lymph node involvement, but also neural invasion and AST/ALT ratio more than 2 might be useful prognostic factors for long-term survival in distal cholangiocarcinoma.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719923","annotations":[{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.734715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.413889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.389409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.381969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.296566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.154959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"}]}
