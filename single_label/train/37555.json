{"id":37555,"title":"Variable phenotype in 17q12 microdeletions: clinical and molecular characterization of a new case.","abstract":"Microdeletions of 17q12 including the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta (HNF1B) gene, as well as point mutations of this gene, are associated with the Renal Cysts and Diabetes syndrome (RCAD, OMIM 137920) and genitourinary alterations. Also, microdeletions encompassing HNF1B were identified as a cause of Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser Syndrome (MRKH, OMIM 277000) in females and, recently, were associated with intellectual disability, autistic features, cerebral anomaly and facial dysmorphisms. In this report, we describe a boy with a deletion in 17q12 region detected by SNP array, encompassing the HNF1B gene, that showed dysmorphic features, intellectual disability (ID), serious speech delay and autistic features. In addition, obesity was observed. In order to study the parental origin of the rearrangement, we analyzed selected SNPs in the deleted area in the patient and his parents, showing Mendelian incompatibilities suggesting a de novo deletion on the chromosome of maternal origin. Our case confirms the incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of this deletion, its complex clinical variability, and strengthens the evidence that ID and stereotyped behaviors may be part of the phenotypic spectrum characterizing the affected patients. Also, it is useful to further delineate the phenotypes associated to the deletion being the first case in which obesity has been documented. We present a genotype-phenotype correlation discussing the possible role of some genes, encompassed by the deletion, in the etiology of the observed phenotypes.
