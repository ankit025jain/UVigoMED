{"id":65873,"title":"Anterior fascial fixation does not reduce the parastomal hernia rate after radical cystectomy and ileal conduit.","abstract":"To compare the rate of parastomal hernia in patients undergoing anterior fascial fixation of the ileal conduit with that in patients without fascial fixation. Limited data exist on whether anterior fascial fixation of the ileal conduit impacts the rate of parastomal hernia.A total of 496 consecutive patients undergoing radical cystectomy and ileal conduit reconstruction from 1995 to 2012 were retrospectively evaluated for parastomal hernia. All patients had a 2-fingerbreadth aperture and the ileal conduit brought through the rectus muscle and sheath. Patients were divided into 1 of 3 groups based on stoma fixation and/or reinforcement: anterior fascial fixation, posterior reinforcement, or no fascial fixation. A parastomal hernia was defined as a palpable bulge at the stoma site. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted for the primary end point of parastomal hernia, controlling for other patient- and treatment-related factors that might affect the rate of parastomal hernia.Median follow-up was 16 months (range, 1-189 months). The parastomal hernia rate was significantly greater in the anterior fascial suture group (43 of 281; 15.3%) than the no fascial suture group (12 of 164; 7.3%; P=.02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis modeled for the occurrence of a parastomal hernia demonstrated that anterior fascial fixation was an independent predictor of the development of parastomal hernia (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-5.14; P=.04).Anterior fascial fixation of the ileal conduit does not reduce the risk of parastomal hernia formation compared with the patients treated without fascial fixation. Surgeons should consider avoiding anterior suture fixation during ileal conduit creation.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768021","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.684582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.496378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.321708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.279585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Aperture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture"},{"name":"Stoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma"},{"name":"Group 12 element","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_12_element"},{"name":"Finger (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(unit)"},{"name":"Ileal conduit urinary diversion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileal_conduit_urinary_diversion"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"1189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1189"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
