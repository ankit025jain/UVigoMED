{"id":82459,"title":"Audit report and systematic review of orolingual angioedema in post-acute stroke thrombolysis.","abstract":"Post-intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) orolingual angioedema (PIROLA), including the life-threatening form, is an underappreciated complication of ischaemic stroke treatment.We present an audit report and a systematic review of published observational studies on PIROLA occurrence in acute ischaemic stroke patients.Clinical files of patients treated in the stroke unit of Bourg-en-Bresse General Hospital (France) from January 2010 to December 2012 were reviewed, and MEDLINE (inception to May 2013) were searched and bibliographies/citations of retrieved articles examined for evidence of PIROLA.Of the 129 acute ischaemic stroke patients treated at Bourg-en-Bresse between 2010 and 2012, four patients, all receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), developed a PIROLA (cumulative incidence rate: 32‰). The complication started within an hour of receiving r-tPA and integrally resolved within 3-24 hours, with antihistamines/steroid treatment in two patients. The systematic review identified 27 studies, totalising with ours, over 9050 acute ischaemic stroke patients from 12 countries, among whom 100 (cumulative incidence rate: 17‰; 95% confidence intervals: 8-26), developed a PIROLA within 6-240 minutes of receiving r-tPA, 0-100% of them occurring among patients on ACEI. The complication was contralateral to the stroke location in 47% cases, ipsilateral in 14%, and bilateral in 39%; and resolved within 24 hours with treatment in 90%. No related death was recorded.About 17‰ acute ischaemic stroke patients receiving r-tPA develop PIROLA, occurring essentially among those on concomitant ACEI. PIROLA occurrence should be actively monitored, particularly within the first few hours as some may require urgent lifesaving procedures.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620962","annotations":[{"name":"ACE inhibitor","weight":0.892154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.831555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Angioedema","weight":0.734118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioedema"},{"name":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.561551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.536523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.524281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.442639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.410231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"France","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.222908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0475422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"}]}
