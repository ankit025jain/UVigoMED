{"id":22783,"title":"Etiology of peritonitis.","abstract":"To determine the etiology of peritonitis, as well as the sensitivity of isolated bacteria to antibiotics.Study was performed at the Surgical Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Department of Microbiology, Department of Clinical Pharmacology of University Clinical Centre (UCC) Tuzla. In a prospective study, starting from 1.6.2009. to 30.6.2010., was 60 patients analyzed who underwent surgery for acute peritonitis in the Surgical Clinic, UCC Tuzla.After microbiological processing of the content of the operative field, wound swabs and smears of drainage, we isolated Gram positive coccid bacteria: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 18.36%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12.6%, while Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecum were found in 3.44% isolates. In the group of Gram-negative bacteria we isolated: Escherichia coli in 15.51%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 10.34% of the cases. The sensitivity of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was largest to vancomycin (100%), and lowest to penicillin (10%) and Staphylococcus aureus sensitivity was largest to vancomycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate (100%) and lowest to penicillins (3.7%). Sensitivity of the facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli was highest to carbapenems 95-100%, and lowest to penicillin preparations 0-56%.Based on the results of microbiological findings of 83.33% patients empirical antibiotic therapy was appropriately involved, and in 16.67% was inadequate and later changed, following the results of microbiological findings. This study indicates the importance and validity of microbiological diagnostics to determine the etiology of peritonitis and appropriate selection of antibiotics to treat these infections, with the required surgical treatment.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520754","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecalis","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Gram-positive bacteria","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-positive_bacteria"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.822872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.801413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Facultative anaerobic organism","weight":0.776736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultative_anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.622433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gram staining","weight":0.60981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_staining"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.474015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.414693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.412342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Clinical pharmacology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pharmacology"},{"name":"Post-transcriptional modification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification"}]}
