{"id":15627,"title":"Tragedy, transformation, and triumph: comparing the factors and forces that led to the adoption of the 1860 Adulteration Act in England and the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act in the United States.","abstract":"The 1860 Adulteration Act in England and the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act in the United States were two of the earliest pieces of legislation to provide generalized regulation of food and drugs on a national scale. While significant scholarly attention has been given to explaining the factors and forces that led to the passage of each Act independent of the other, few books or articles have directly compared the similar individuals and events that led to the adoption of both Acts. This paper attempts to fill that gap. Through a comparative examination, this paper reveals that four main components were key to the national pure food and drug movements in both countries: individuals who crusaded for national adulteration legislation; tragedies that shocked the public into calling for reform; press and publicity that was willing and able to bring the evils of adulteration to the forefront of the public mind; and a transformation of the social, political, and economic systems, which created atmospheres conducive to reform. This paper aims to shed new light on the 1860 Adulteration Act and the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act--two acts that derive their importance not just from the effect that they directly had on the regulation of food and drugs but also as some of the earliest examples of western governments coming to recognize the need for national regulation to protect the public from harm and coming to embrace their changing role as spearheads of modern regulatory states.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163213","annotations":[{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.665884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.635528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.543733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Legislation","weight":0.472268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"England","weight":0.384444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Supermarket","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket"},{"name":"Book","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Tragedy","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"NATO","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO"},{"name":"Acts of the Apostles","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles"},{"name":"News media","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Pure Food and Drug Act","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act"},{"name":"Publicity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Transformer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer"},{"name":"1860","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860"},{"name":"Comparative religion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_religion"},{"name":"Atmosphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"Shed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shed"},{"name":"Adulterant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adulterant"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Reform","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform"}]}
