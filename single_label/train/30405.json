{"id":30405,"title":"Rosacea-like facial rash related to metformin administration in a young woman.","abstract":"Since the skin represents a common site of adverse drug reactions, few data are reported at this time regarding the development of skin rash during the treatment with antidiabetic drugs.We report a 29-year old woman that developed a facial skin rash during the treatment with metformin. Clinical and laboratory findings excluded the presence of systemic diseases, but several diagnosis and many drugs were administered without clinical improvement. The self-dismission of metformin induced an improvement of symptoms, while the re-challenge documented an impairments of skin rash. The Naranjo probability scale suggested a probable association between metformin and skin rash and metformin was definitively dismissed.We report for the first time a non vasculitis facial skin manifestation related to metformin in a young woman. However, this case may emphasizes the need to consider the ADRs as a differential diagnosis in order to reduce medical errors and the related medical costs.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507578","annotations":[{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.663323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.605583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.55124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.281533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.15001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
