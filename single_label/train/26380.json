{"id":26380,"title":"Serum adipocyte fatty acid binding protein levels are positively associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in Chinese pre- and postmenopausal women with normal glucose tolerance.","abstract":"Recent studies highlight a critical interaction between adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) and cardiovascular disorders. However, associations of A-FABP with subclinical atherosclerosis in a population with normal glucose tolerance remain unknown.The study aimed to evaluate the relationship between A-FABP and carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT) in a Chinese population with normal glucose tolerance.A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of 2253 cardiovascular disease-free normal glucose tolerance subjects (835 men, 1418 women; 20-78 years old) from the Shanghai Obesity Study.C-IMT was measured by B-mode ultrasound and used to assess subclinical atherosclerosis. Serum A-FABP levels were quantified by a sandwich ELISA.The median serum level for A-FABP was 4.0 ng/mL (interquartile range: 2.6-6.0 ng/mL), and significantly higher in women than men (P < .001). After adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI), a partial correlation analysis showed that A-FABP levels correlated with C-IMT in men, premenopausal, and postmenopausal women (P = .024, .006, and .016, respectively). Furthermore, C-IMT increased along with quartile A-FABP values (all P for trend <.001). Regression analyses demonstrated that A-FABP was associated with C-IMT only in women (P = .044 and .001 for pre- and postmenopausal, respectively). Moreover, A-FABP was identified as a risk factor for C-IMT in pre- and postmenopausal women with a normal BMI (P < .001 and P = .012, respectively).Serum A-FABP levels independently and positively correlate with subclinical atherosclerosis in pre- and postmenopausal Chinese women with normal glucose tolerance after adjustments for the traditional risk factors.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25127012","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.909265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.802062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.767901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.714106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.688496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.359516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.188432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0998945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Sandwich","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
