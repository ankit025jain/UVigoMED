{"id":50472,"title":"[Ovarian torsion. long-term follow-up of the black-bluish ovary after laparoscopic detorsion].","abstract":"Ovarian torsion presents low incidence in children and unspecific clinical presentation, therefore the diagnostic delay is rather common. Traditionally, necrotic appearance has been synonymous of oophorectomy, however the current trend defends ovary preservation. We present our experience in conservative management of ovarian torsion.A retrospective review was made of patients between May 2010 and May 2013. Seven girls were operated by laparoscopy because of ultrasound and clinical suspicion of ovarian torsion. The diagnosis was confirmed in six patients, finding an enlarged, friable and black-bluish ovary. Detorsion and adnexal sparing were performed in all cases, despite the gross appearance.The mean age was 8.5 years (3-12), the time interval between the onset of symptoms to surgery was 6.5 days (1-15) and postoperative stay was 2.6 days (2-3). In 4 cases the damaged ovary was right, and the average size was 5.8 cm. Tumor markers were normal. During the first 6 months the follow-up ultrasound showed good results. However, the long-term outcome evidenced one involved ovary atrophied and two oophorectomies due to recurrent adnexal torsion and ovarian mass consistent with teratoma.Laparoscopic conservative management with untwisting the ovary, allows that macroscopically nonviable ovaries could be recovered. However, an exhaustive and long-term follow-up is required to confirm the outcome.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783643","annotations":[{"name":"Teratoma","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"},{"name":"Oophorectomy","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oophorectomy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.793433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ovarian torsion","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_torsion"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Fetal viability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability"},{"name":"Torsion (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Friability","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friability"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Synonym","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
