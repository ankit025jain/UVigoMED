{"id":55601,"title":"Genetics and ocular disorders: a focused review.","abstract":"Increasingly accurate phenotyping leads to better genetic evaluation. Genetic eye conditions may be due to a common cellar defect (eg, ciliopathies or RASopathies). Early-onset retinal dystrophies may be associated with renal disease. An understanding of genetic testing helps clinicians identify shortcomings in testing which may lead to a better understanding of the most appropriate test for a given ocular condition. Dedicated genetic counselors within ophthalmic and pediatric clinics are likely to improve the delivery of clinical care in these settings.
