{"id":56582,"title":"Analysis of mouse RPE sheet morphology gives discriminatory categories.","abstract":"We are interested in developing quantitative tools to study retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) morphology. We want to detect changes in the RPE by strain, disease, genotype, and age. Ultimately these tools should be useful in predicting retinal disease progression. The morphometric data will also help us to understand RPE sheet formation and barrier functions. A clear disruption of the regular cell size and shape appeared in mouse mutants. Aspect ratio and cell area together gave rise to principal components that predicted age and genotype accurately and well before visually obvious damage could be seen.
