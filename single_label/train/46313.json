{"id":46313,"title":"Visualization of liver uptake function using the uptake contrast-enhanced ratio in hepatobiliary phase imaging.","abstract":"To visualize liver uptake function using the uptake contrast-enhanced ratio in hepatobiliary phase (uptake CERH) magnetic resonance imaging.Thirty-seven patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 23 with metastatic liver cancer were evaluated. Hepatobiliary phase images were acquired 20min after an intravenous bolus injection of gadoxetic acid disodium. We assumed that the contrast-enhanced ratio in the hepatobiliary phase (CERH) in the spleen was similar to the contrast-enhanced ratio in the extracellular matrix (CEREM). The Uptake CERH value was defined as the percentage signal gain between the precontrast and hepatobiliary phase images (without CEREM). The Uptake CERH value measured the tumor-free liver parenchyma. The association of the uptake CERH value with the biochemical liver function test results, and hepatocellular density in the liver parenchyma was assessed. Correlations were examined using Pearson correlation coefficient and the Mann-Whitney test.The uptake CERH value was correlated with albumin, bilirubin, indocyanine green retention rate at 15min, prothrombin activity(%), platelet count, and cellular density in the liver parenchyma (p<0.01).Uptake CERH images are useful for visualizing liver uptake function.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637082","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.839674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.760992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.722519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.710769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.381049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.361029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.260981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.129987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Gain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Hepatobiliary system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatobiliary_system"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
