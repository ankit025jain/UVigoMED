{"id":51546,"title":"[Multi-center study of premature thelarche and gynecomastia in Chinese infants and toddlers].","abstract":"The term \"premature thelarche\" refers to isolated breast development before 8 years of age in female, without any other signs of sexual maturation, while \"gynecomastia\" is the presence of breast tissue in males. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of premature thelarche and gynecomastia in Chinese infants and toddlers, identify the potential risk factors, and explore the influence of early breast development on physical growth, mental development and psychomotor development.A total of 1 510 full term and healthy children at the age of 0-48 months were sampled by stratified cluster random sampling method from 8 provinces from 2011-2012. Weight, height and breast development were assessed by senior primary pediatricians, while Bayley Scale of Infant Development-I (BSID-I) was used to measure the mental developmental index (MDI) and psychomotor developmental index (PDI) for children aged 2-30 months. Social-demographic Questionnaires were completed by the caregivers.The combined prevalence of premature thelarche and gynecomastia was 1.6% (23/1 475), girls 2.2% (15/695), boys 1.0% (8/780), all within 2 years of age. The birth weight, feeding patterns in first 4 months, delivery mode, weaning time and social economic status were not significantly associated with the breast development. However, lower father's education level (OR = 3.632, 95%CI = 1.565-8.432) as well as smoking mother (OR = 18.960, 95%CI = 1.590-226.304) were significantly related to breast development even after adjusting for potential confounders. Lower weight (-0.479 ± 0.648 vs. 0.005 ± 0.987, P < 0.05) and height (-0.602 ± 1.042 vs. 0.008 ± 0.986, P < 0.05) Z score were found in breast development group, even after adjusting for age, gender and father' education level. Neither mental development (t = -0.082, P > 0.05) nor psychomotor development (t = 1.054, P > 0.05) was associated with breast development.We showed a similar prevalence of premature thelarche with the data reported in similar studies reported from other countries. Among the 0-48 months old infants and toddlers, Father's education level and smoking mother were both related to breast development. Breast development was significantly associated with physical growth, but had no correlation with the mental or psychomotor development.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Endocrine System
