{"id":62195,"title":"Successful delivery of fetus with fetal inherited thrombophilia after two fetal deaths.","abstract":"A pregnant woman with inherited thrombophilia (factor II mutation--20210A) had two late pregnancy losses. The first pregnancy was not well documented, but the second pregnancy was complicated by fetal thrombophilia and umbilical artery thrombosis, proven after fetal death. During the third pregnancy enoxaparine was introduced in the therapy and early amniocentesis was performed. Fetal thrombophilia was proven again. Early delivery was induced and performed with no complications, resulting in a live healthy infant. A history of miscarriages or recurrent fetal loss should raise suspicion of thrombophilia as a potential cause. It is debatable whether amniocentesis in pursuit of fetal thrombophilia should be performed and whether this will lead to a better perinatal outcome. When fetal thrombophilia is diagnosed, an earlier induction of delivery should be considered, taking into account the fetal extrauterine viability. The aforementioned approach of early delivery in cases of inherited fetal thrombophilia could be a possible solution for better perinatal outcomes.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611356","annotations":[{"name":"Amniocentesis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.757811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.731169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.718098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.221289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Umbilical artery","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_artery"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.143643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fetal viability","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"}]}
