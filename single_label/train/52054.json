{"id":52054,"title":"Clinical factors associated with biochemical adrenal-cortisol insufficiency in hospitalized patients.","abstract":"Diagnosis of adrenal-cortisol insufficiency is often misleading in hospitalized patients, as clinical and biochemical features overlap with comorbidities. We analyzed clinical determinants associated with a biochemical diagnosis of adrenal-cortisol insufficiency in non-intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalized patients.In a retrospective cohort study we reviewed 4668 inpatients with random morning cortisol levels ?15 ?g/dL hospitalized in our center between 2003 and 2010. Using serum cortisol threshold level of 18 ?g/dL 30 or 60 minutes after Cortrosyn (250 ?g; Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, Calif) injection to define biochemical adrenal-cortisol status, we characterized and compared insufficient (n = 108, serum cortisol ?18 ?g/dL) and sufficient (n = 394; serum cortisol >18 ?g/dL) non-ICU hospitalized patients.Commonly reported clinical and routine biochemical adrenal-cortisol insufficiency features were similar between insufficient and sufficient inpatients. Biochemical adrenal-cortisol insufficiency was associated with increased frequency of liver disease, specifically hepatitis C (P = .01) and prior orthotopic liver transplantation (P <.001), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; P = .005), and reported pre-existing male hypogonadism (P <.001), as compared with the biochemical adrenal-cortisol sufficiency group. Forty percent of insufficient inpatients were not treated with glucocorticoids after diagnosis. Multivariable logistic analysis demonstrated that inpatients with higher cortisol levels (P = .0001) and higher diastolic blood pressure (P = .05), and females (P = .009) were more likely not to be treated, while those with previous short-term glucocorticoid treatment (P = .002), other coexisting endocrine diseases (P = .005), or who received an in-hospital endocrinology consultation (P <.0001), were more likely to be replaced with glucocorticoids.Commonly reported adrenal-cortisol insufficiency features do not reliably identify hospitalized patients biochemically confirmed to have this disorder. Comorbidities including hepatitis C, prior orthotopic liver transplantation, HIV, and reported pre-existing male hypogonadism may help identify hospitalized non-ICU patients for more rigorous adrenal insufficiency assessment.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632056","annotations":[{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Adrenal insufficiency","weight":0.85672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_insufficiency"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.835475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.710403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.706059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endocrine disease","weight":0.497521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.468739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.381229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.332676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.280281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.184664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.0239641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
