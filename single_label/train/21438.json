Patients exposed to a contaminated hospital environment had 2.77 times the risk of acquiring carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii than did unexposed patients (relative risk, 2.77 [95% confidence interval, 1.50-5.13]; P = .002).","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602951","annotations":[{"name":"Risk","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.15852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
