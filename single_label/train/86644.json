{"id":86644,"title":"Fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing to assess swallowing outcomes as a function of head position in a normal population.","abstract":"Head position practice has been shown to influence pill-swallowing ability, but the impact of head position on measures of swallowing outcomes has not yet been studied with fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether head position impacts penetration-aspiration scale scores and/or post-swallow pharyngeal residue as assessed by FEES. Documenting the incidence of pharyngeal residue and laryngeal penetration and aspiration in a normal population was a secondary goal.Adults without swallowing difficulties (N?=?84) were taught a pill swallowing technique based on learning five head positions and were asked to practice with small, hard candies (e.g., TicTacs) for two weeks. Then they demonstrated swallowing in each of the head positions for two conditions, liquid and purée, while undergoing FEES.Out of 840 examined swallows, one event of aspiration and 5 events of penetration occurred. During practice >50% participants found positions they preferred over the center position for swallowing but head position was not associated with penetration-aspiration scores assessed by FEES. Significant associations and non-significant trends were found between pharyngeal residue and three variables: age, most preferred head position, and least preferred head position.Head position during swallowing (head up) and age greater than 40 years may result in increased pharyngeal residue but not laryngeal penetration or aspiration.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755159","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.494037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.401407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.101538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.0583776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"840","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/840"},{"name":"Candy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Centre (ice hockey)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.0156704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Swallow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"N84 road (Ireland)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N84_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"}]}
