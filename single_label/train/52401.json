{"id":52401,"title":"Behavioral contributions to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Behavioral contributions to the pathogenesis of prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) include lifestyle behaviors including dietary intake, exercise, sedentariness, sleep, and stress. The purpose of this paper is to review evidence for the metabolic pathways by which the behavior is linked to T2D. Evidence for interventions, which change each of the lifestyle behaviors, is discussed. The article will close with a brief discussion on how new technologies may provide opportunities to better understand relationships between moment-to-moment fluctuations in behaviors and diabetes pathogenesis, as well as provide opportunities to personalize and adapt interventions to achieve successful behavior change and maintenance of that change. Especially promising are new technologies, which assist in tracking lifestyle behaviors along with clinical and metabolic outcomes.
