{"id":4617,"title":"A retrospective study of acute mountain sickness on Mt. Kilimanjaro using trekking company data.","abstract":"High altitude illnesses (HAI) are a risk factor for any individual who is exposed to a significant increase in altitude. To learn more about the epidemiology of HAI, we sought to determine if health records from a commercial trekking company could provide novel data on the prevalence of HAI, as well as efficacy data regarding common HAI therapeutics.Health parameters from 917 tourists ascending Mt. Kilimanjaro over a 10-yr period were analyzed for meaningful data.Of all subjects, 70% experienced at least one instance of a symptom related to HAI (headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite) during the trek. Acetazolamide was used at least once by 90% of subjects and, of those who used acetazolamide, 92% began taking it on day 1 of the ascent. Acetazolamide was found to improve oxygen saturation 1.2% above 9842.5 ft (3000 m). Dexamethasone use 12 h prior to ascending above 18,996 ft (5790 m) decreased the probability of a subject exhibiting at least one AMS symptom at that altitude.The prevalence of AMS symptoms was not reduced by taking 2 extra days to reach the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Prophylactic acetazolamide modestly improved oxygen saturation; however, it did not reduce symptoms. Therapeutic dexamethasone, especially at higher altitudes, was effective at reducing symptoms. We conclude that meaningful high altitude physiological data can be obtained from private trekking companies.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329946","annotations":[{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.884812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.776284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.770957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acetazolamide","weight":0.703216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetazolamide"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.520985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.510971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.43674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.374545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.370851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Altitude sickness","weight":0.339588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"High altitude","weight":0.102522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_altitude"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Mount Kilimanjaro","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"}]}
