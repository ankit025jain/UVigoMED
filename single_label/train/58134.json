{"id":58134,"title":"Rare extrapelvic endometriosis on iliac vein wall--diagnosis and treatment.","abstract":"Although endometriosis is a relatively common illness in women during the reproductive period, extrapelvic localization of endometriosis is a relatively rare finding which can pose a differential diagnostic problem. Diagnosis and surgical treatment of a patient with endometriotic tumor located on the outer wall of the left common iliac vein are discussed. Patient underwent surgery because of circulatory disorders and left leg edema. Histopathological findings verified endometriosis on the outer wall of the common left iliac vein without other localizations.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992793","annotations":[{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.64757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.633261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.633261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.581676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.569144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Common iliac vein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_iliac_vein"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Localization of a ring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_ring"},{"name":"Rare Ltd.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Ltd."},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Iliac vein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliac_vein"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Common iliac artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_iliac_artery"}]}
