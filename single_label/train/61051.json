{"id":61051,"title":"KIR haplotype B donors but not KIR-ligand mismatch result in a reduced incidence of relapse after haploidentical transplantation using reduced intensity conditioning and CD3/CD19-depleted grafts.","abstract":"Natural killer (NK)-cell alloreactivity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is influenced by the interaction of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on donor NK cells and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands on recipient cells. We investigated the influence of donor KIR haplotype and KIR-ligand mismatch (MM) on relapse in 57 patients with hematologic malignancies receiving haploidentical HCT after reduced intensity conditioning and graft CD3/CD19 depletion. Of the 57 donors, 17 had KIR haplotype A (29.8 %) and 40 had KIR haplotype B (70.2 %). A KIR-ligand MM was found in 34 of 57 patients (59.6 %). There was no difference between donor KIR haplotypes in non-relapse mortality (NRM, p?=?0.200) but had a significantly reduced incidence of relapse for patients with a haplotype B donor (p?=?0.001). In particular, patients in partial remission (PR) benefited more from a haplotype B graft (p?=?0.008) than patients in complete remission (CR, p?=?0.297). Evaluating KIR-ligand MM cumulative incidences of relapse (p?=?0.680) or NRM (p?=?0.579), we found no significant difference. In conclusion, in the setting of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and CD3/CD19-depleted haploidentical HCT, we could not confirm the positive data with KIR-ligand MM but observed a significant lower risk of relapse with a KIR haplotype B donor.
