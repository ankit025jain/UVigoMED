{"id":77628,"title":"[Legal aspects of workers' health protection against asbestos in Poland in the light of the EU legal framework].","abstract":"Legal protection of human life and health against asbestos dust-related hazards is carried out in various dimensions of the European Union law mainly focused on health protection of employees and responsibilities of employers, as well as on environmental protection. The aim of this paper is to present the Community legal issues emphasizing the protection of workers against asbestos and discuss the current state of Polish law in this regard. An analysis of recent legal solutions provides a comprehensive look at the extensive steps currently taken to reduce the risk of exposure to asbestos dust. The legislation in the European Union, including Poland indicates sound foundations for assuring health and safety of workers still exposed to asbestos and those formerly employed in asbestos processing plants. It is only postulated to unify high standards of healthcare to provide all workers employed in asbestos exposure with equal and particular legal protection.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502132","annotations":[{"name":"European Union","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"European Union law","weight":0.732061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Legislation","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Social security","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.604279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.599981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Asbestos","weight":0.543331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environmental protection","weight":0.357292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.328393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Law of Poland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Poland"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Foundation (non-profit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(non-profit)"},{"name":"Unification of Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"}]}
