{"id":87099,"title":"Partial characterization of new adenoviruses found in lizards.","abstract":"In the years 2011-2012, a consensus nested polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of adenovirus (AdV) infection in reptiles. During this screening, three new AdVs were detected. One of these viruses was detected in three lizards from a group of green striped tree dragons (Japalura splendida). Another was detected in a green anole (Anolis carolinensis). A third virus was detected in a Jackson's chameleon (Chamaeleo jacksonii). Analysis of a portion of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase genes of each of these viruses revealed that they all were different from one another and from all previously described reptilian AdVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial DNA polymerase gene sequence showed that all newly detected viruses clustered within the genus Atadenovirus. This is the first description of AdVs in these lizard species.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000689","annotations":[{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.797832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Reptile","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Lizard","weight":0.659918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard"},{"name":"Chameleon","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameleon"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.57651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.229368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Anolis","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anolis"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polychrotidae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychrotidae"},{"name":"Carolina anole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_anole"},{"name":"Dragon","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chamaeleo","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaeleo"}]}
