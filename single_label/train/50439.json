{"id":50439,"title":"Home is where I want to die: Kelly's journey.","abstract":"The definition of a 'good death' is centred on being peaceful, dignified and pain free. The preferred place of death has also been highlighted as an important concept in defining a good death (Cox, Almack, Pollack, & Seymour, 2011). Seventy percent of Australians express the desire to spend their last days at home. In reality only 16% of people die at home (Preferred Place of Death, 2008). With 10% of Australians dying in residential aged care facilities and approximately 20% in hospices, the rest die in hospitals (Parish et al., 2006). Family support and the family's care giving ability play a major role in determining whether a person is able to die at home. Other factors include the availability of medical and nursing care.
