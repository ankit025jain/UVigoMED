{"id":79159,"title":"[Extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor in nose: 2 cases report and review of literature].","abstract":"To analyze the clinical characteristics, imaging features, pathological findings, treatment and prognosis of the extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor (EPSFT) in nose, and then to improve the quality of diagnosis and treatment of EPSFT.Clinical data of two patients with EPSFT were collected in recent 2 years. All the information, including clinical symptoms, imaging characteristics, blood routine, serum biochemical, treatment options, pathological immunohistochemical findings, and following-up results were reported and analyzed, and the clinical features of EPSFT in the nose were summarized with review of the literature.(1) The main clinical characteristics were nasal obstructive and epistaxis. (2)There were no imaging differences essentially between EPSFT and other tumors in nasal cavity. In terms of enhancement CT scanning, the image manifestations of EPSET were similar to that of hemangioma to a certain degree in nasal cavity. (3) Routine blood and serum biochemical test were normal in the patients with EPSFT in the nose. (4)Confirmed diagnosis mainly depended on pathological and immunohistochemical findings. (5) These two patients underwent surgical treatment, and the tumors were en bloc resected, and were in full recovery. Follow-up time is 2 years in one case and the other one is 1 year. No recurrence or metastasis were found in these two patients.DSA and vascular embolism is recommended before surgical treatment in some patients. En bloc resection is the preferred treatment option with definite curative effect for the patients with EPSFT in nose, and the prognosis is favorable.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479359","annotations":[{"name":"Epistaxis","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistaxis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.735443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.695533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.638467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Solitary fibrous tumor","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_fibrous_tumor"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Bachelor's degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
