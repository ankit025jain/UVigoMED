{"id":35009,"title":"Glomus tumors in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1.","abstract":"Glomus tumors have recently been reported in individuals with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer disposition syndrome. We compare the clinical and molecular features of these painful hamartomas in a series of sporadic and NF1-associated cases.We sought to evaluate the association of NF1 with glomus tumors and to compare NF1-associated glomus tumors with sporadic glomus tumors.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all individuals with a histopathologic diagnosis of glomus tumor at a large tertiary care center from January 1998 to January 2013. Charts were reviewed for a coexisting diagnosis of NF1.A total of 42 glomus tumors were identified in 34 individuals. Twelve (28.6%) were found in 6 patients with NF1. In 28 individuals with 30 sporadic tumors, there was no coexisting medical condition. Although multifocal tumors (16.7%) and tumor recurrence (33.3%) were more common in association with NF1, these trends did not reach statistical significance. NF1-associated glomus tumors exhibited no neurofibromin immunoreactivity, whereas their sporadic counterparts retained neurofibromin expression.The retrospective design resulted in incomplete data capture.Detection of glomus tumors should raise suspicion for a concurrent diagnosis of NF1.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685357","annotations":[{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.790693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.687357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.657876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis","weight":0.629079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.613598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis type I","weight":0.354457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis_type_I"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.294237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.287357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.276722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Hamartoma","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Glomus tumor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomus_tumor"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Automatic identification and data capture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_and_data_capture"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Glomus (fungus)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomus_(fungus)"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Missing data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data"},{"name":"List of Chancellors of Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chancellors_of_Germany"},{"name":"Medical condition","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_condition"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Disposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition"}]}
