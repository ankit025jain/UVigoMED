{"id":15773,"title":"Scarlet fever in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"Assessment of the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland in 2012.The evaluation was performed by analysing surveillance data published in the bulletin, \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012\" (Warsaw 2013, NIPH-NIH, CSI) and also in bulletins from previous years, and unpublished data collected under Statistical survey program of official statistics.In the last 15-20 years in Poland has been observed more than 2-fold lengthening of scarlet fever epidemic cycle, slowdown in the decline and slower growth rate in epidemic curve and decrease in average annual incidence. In 2012, in the country a total of 25 421 cases were registered and incidence was 66.0 per 100 000 population (in voivodeships: from 25.8 in ?Ã³dzkie to 114.2 in pomorskie). The highest incidence was notified in 5-year-old (1094.7) and 6-year-old children (877.3), however, the incidence among children and young people up to 15 years accounted for 95.6% of all cases. The incidence of men (74.8) was higher by almost 30% than the incidence of women (57.6). The incidence was higher in urban areas than in rural areas and was 72.7 (in rural area 55.7). 0.9% of patients were hospitalized. No deaths related to the disease were reported.Distinct changes in the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in recent decades are related to, i.a., aging of the Polish population and decline in the number of children, group particularly vulnerable to infection. In order to improve accuracy of surveillance data, it is recommended significantly increase percentage of cases in which clinical diagnosis will be confirmed by the result of bacteriological examination.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
