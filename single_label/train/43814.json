{"id":43814,"title":"Prediction of postoperative pancreatic fistulas after pancreatectomy: assessment with acoustic radiation force impulse elastography.","abstract":"The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the usefulness of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography of the pancreas for predicting postoperative pancreatic fistula occurrence after pancreatic resection.Twenty-five patients underwent ARFI elastography of the pancreas before pancreatic resection (11 men and 14 women; mean age, 59.1 years; range, 28-76 years). In each patient, 3 valid ARFI measurements (meters per second) were performed at the head of the pancreas, and the median values were calculated. Patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 18) or distal pancreatectomy (n = 7). Clinically relevant fistulas (grade B or higher) were determined according to the standard criteria used by the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula. Preoperative ARFI values were compared between the fistula and nonfistula groups (Mann-Whitney test).Clinically relevant fistulas (grade B or higher) were observed in 8 patients (32%; fistula group), including 5 of 18 patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy (28%) and 3 of 7 patients with distal pancreatectomy (43%). The ARFI values in the fistula group (median, 1.45 m/s; range, 0.80-1.98 m/s) were lower than in the nonfistula group (median, 1.54 m/s; range, 0.98-3.40 m/s), but there was no statistical significance (P = .1374). When confining the results to only patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy, the ARFI values were significantly lower in the patients with fistulas (median, 0.98 m/s; range, 0.80-1.94 m/s) than in those without fistulas (median, 1.60 m/s; range, 1.08-3.40 m/s; P = .0460).This preliminary study showed the potential feasibility of a clinical application of ARFI elastography in preoperatively predicting postoperative pancreatic fistulas after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Investigation of this method in larger studies is needed.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764332","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.560932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.334625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.312234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.251152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.141169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0884832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Elastography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography"},{"name":"Pancreatic fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_fistula"},{"name":"Head of pancreas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_pancreas"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1374","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1374"},{"name":"983","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/983"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Metre per second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second"},{"name":"B movie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Study Group International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Group_International"},{"name":"Radiation pressure","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure"}]}
