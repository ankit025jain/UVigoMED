{"id":28430,"title":"Efficacy and safety of celgosivir in patients with dengue fever (CELADEN): a phase 1b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial.","abstract":"Dengue infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide, but no suitable antiviral drugs are available. We tested the ?-glucosidase inhibitor celgosivir as a treatment for acute dengue fever.We screened 69 patients and randomly assigned 50 (24 to celgosivir, 26 to placebo). Mean VLR was greater in the celgosivir group (-1·86, SD 1·07) than in the placebo group (-1·64, 0·75), but the difference was non-significant (-0·22, 90% CI -0·65 to 0·22; one-sided p=0·203). The mean AUC was also higher in the celgosivir group (54·92, SD 31·04) than in the placebo group (40·72, 18·69), but again the difference was non-significant (14·20, 90% CI 2·16-26·25; one-sided p=0·973). We noted similar incidences of adverse events between groups.Although generally safe and well tolerated, celgosivir does not seem to reduce viral load or fever burden in patients with dengue.STOP Dengue Translational Clinical Research.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24877997","annotations":[{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.65757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.507161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.466486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.381682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.225146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"1869","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1869"},{"name":"1420","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1420"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Translation (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(physics)"},{"name":"Stop sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_sign"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Structural load","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load"},{"name":"Glycoside hydrolase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside_hydrolase"},{"name":"VLR","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLR"}]}
