{"id":30237,"title":"A rare case of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome relieved by hot water bathing.","abstract":"We present here a case of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), which is an under-recognised disorder presenting in chronic abusers of cannabis typically as cyclical vomiting relieved by frequent hot baths. Increased awareness of CHS allows for earlier recognition by emergency departments, leading to prompter treatment and the prevention of future recurrence through cannabis cessation.
