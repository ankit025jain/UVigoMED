{"id":57202,"title":"Using the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome System morphological measures to predict live birth after assisted reproductive technology.","abstract":"To model morphological assessments of embryo quality that are predictive of live birth.Longitudinal cohort using cycles reported in the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcomes Reporting System (SART CORS) between 2007 andÂ 2011.Clinic-based data.Fresh autologous assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles with ETs on day 3 or day 5 and morphological assessments reported (25,409 cycles with one embryo transferred and 96,093 cycles with two embryos transferred). Live-birth rates were modeled by morphological assessments using backward-stepping logistic regression for cycle 1 and over five cycles, separately for day 3 and day 5 transfers and number of embryos transferred (1 or 2). Additional models for each day of transfer also included the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of embryos cryopreserved.None.Live births.Morphological assessments of grade, stage, fragmentation, and symmetry were significant for the day 3 models; grade, stage, and trophectoderm were significant in the day 5 model; inner-cell mass was significant in the models when two embryos were transferred. Number of oocytes retrieved and number of embryos cryopreserved were significant for both day 3 and day 5 models.These findings confirm the significant association between embryo quality parameters reported to SART CORS and live-birth rate after ART.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217871","annotations":[{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.770828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.647724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cryopreservation","weight":0.646655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.560846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.551629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.371848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Trophoblast","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophoblast"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Extraterrestrial life","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life"},{"name":"Paraphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Transfer (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Pulitzer Prize for Reporting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Reporting"},{"name":"Predictive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_medicine"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Vivipary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivipary"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Search and Rescue Transponder","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_Rescue_Transponder"}]}
