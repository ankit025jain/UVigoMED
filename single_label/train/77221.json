{"id":77221,"title":"[Comparison of the nutritional status of residents in shared-housing arrangements and nursing homes: a secondary data analysis].","abstract":"Malnutrition and weight loss are special challenges in the care of older people particularly with dementia. In Germany, shared-housing arrangements (SHA) for older care-dependent people evolved in the last years. SHA are an alternative to traditional nursing homes. Despite of the increase of SHA in number it remains unclear if this setting is especially beneficial in terms of (mal-)nutrition. Therefore the nutritional status of older people with and without dementia living in SHA and traditional nursing homes will be compared. From 2010 to 2011 data was collected in various SHA in Berlin and in a nursing home in Schkeuditz/Saxony using standardized face-to-face interviews with nurses. In addition to socio-demographic data the nutritional status using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and the cognitive capacities usingthe Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were examined. In the secondary data analysis, data from 129 residents (60 residents from 29 SHA and 69 from a nursing home) were included in the analysis. The residents of both settings were mostly female (76.7%) and on average 80.4 years old and with a moderate to severe cognitive decline (MMSE: 13.2). The average MNA score of residents from both settings is 19.7, indicating a risk for malnutrition. Residents of SHA have a significantly higher (and therefore better) MNA score (21.2) on average than residents in the nursing home (18.3; t-Test p<0.001). The present study shows that residents in SHA show a better nutritional status than residents in the nursing home even when taking into account differences concerning age, gender, care dependency, a medical diagnosis of dementia and the MMSE. Further studies should evaluate the concept of food intake in both settings and evaluate differences.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826428","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.703382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.69917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.562794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.534623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.530849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.511456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.417791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Berlin","weight":0.355396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Mini-mental state examination","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-mental_state_examination"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
