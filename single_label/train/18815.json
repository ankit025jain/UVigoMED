{"id":18815,"title":"Human beta-defensin-3 for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection and loosening.","abstract":"In this study, the difference in expression of human beta-defensin-3 in periprosthetic tissue and cancellous bone was observed in the periprosthetic tissue and cancellous bone of patients in the periprosthetic joint infection group, the aseptic loosening group, and the spacer treatment group as well as the synovial membrane and ilium of the normal control group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the synovial tissue showed different levels of neutrophil infiltration in all groups except for the normal control group. Immunofluorescence staining of periprosthetic tissue and cancellous bone showed the most positive cells expressing human beta-defensin-3 and the largest mean optical density in the periprosthetic joint infection group, followed by the aseptic loosening group, the spacer treatment group, and the normal control group, with a significant difference in comparison between the periprosthetic joint infection group and the other 3 groups (P<.01). White blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level were highest in the periprosthetic joint infection group, whereas no difference was found between the other 3 groups. Taken together, high levels of human beta-defensin-3 protein expression were found in the periprosthetic tissue and cancellous bone of patients with periprosthetic joint infection and aseptic loosening, but there are differential expressions of human beta-defensin-3, and this may provide a new marker for the differential diagnosis of infection and loosening of the artificial joint.
