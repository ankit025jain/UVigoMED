{"id":70689,"title":"Positive psychology group intervention for breast cancer patients: a randomised trial.","abstract":"This study assessed the effects of a psychological group intervention based on positive psychology in women with breast cancer. 175 women were randomly assigned either to an experimental group, receiving the 14-session intervention (n = 87), or to a wait list group (n = 88) that did not receive any type of intervention. For treatment, a group intervention was applied, based on improving psychological strengths and enhancing positive psychology-based styles of coping. Strength-related outcomes, self-esteem, well-being, and happiness were assessed before and after the intervention. The experimental group showed higher scores on all of the study variables after the intervention. Participants reported improved self-esteem, emotional intelligence-related abilities, resilience, and optimism, as well as positive affectivity, well-being, and happiness. The results show a beneficial effect of this psychological intervention based on positive psychology on female breast cancer patients' psychological health.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153949","annotations":[{"name":"Positive psychology","weight":0.851497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Self-esteem","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem"},{"name":"Happiness","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.774264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.657598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.643002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.597921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.590766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.50717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.504919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.397581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Optimism","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Cognitive interventions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_interventions"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Psychological resilience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience"}]}
