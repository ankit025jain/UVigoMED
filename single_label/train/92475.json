{"id":92475,"title":"Arthroscopic evaluation of trochlear dysplasia as an aid in decision making for the treatment of patellofemoral instability.","abstract":"Trochlear dysplasia is an important aetiological factor for the development of patellofemoral instability (PFI). The aim of the study was to identify the arthroscopic morphology of trochlear dysplasia that can be helpful when planning operative treatment for PFI.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and strict lateral radiographs of 46 patients treated for PFI were assigned according to Dejour and matched with arthroscopic views from the lateral superior arthroscopic portal. On arthroscopy, signs of trochlear dysplasia were identified and classified into two types. Intra- and inter-observer agreements of the arthroscopic evaluation were assessed.Arthroscopically, 2 major types of trochlear dysplasia could be distinguished. Type I shows a flat trochlear groove with an elevated trochlear floor in relation to the anterior femoral cortex. In type II, the proximal trochlea was convex with a lateral trochlear bump. Arthroscopic evaluation was not consistent with the Dejour's radiographic and axial MRI classification. Arthroscopic grading showed excellent intra- and inter-observer agreements (81-92%).Arthroscopic evaluation can give additional information about the severity of trochlear dysplasia. This additional information can be used as an aid in decision making for the treatment of PFI.II.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23824254","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.764089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.744462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.715102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.568255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.487032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.456462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.325221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.204814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.126576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.118155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Private finance initiative","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_finance_initiative"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Trochlear nerve","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Groove (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Verbania","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbania"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
