{"id":66952,"title":"Value of diffusion-weighted imaging at 3 T for prediction of extracapsular extension in patients with prostate cancer: a preliminary study.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the value of adding diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to T2-weighted imaging for the prediction of extracapsular extension (ECE) in patients with prostate cancer, as well as to compare apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) between patients with and without ECE.Seventy-six patients with suspected prostate cancer underwent T2-weighted imaging and DWI at 3 T using a phased-array coil, followed by radical prostatectomy. For prediction of ECE, the prostate was divided into six sectors. Two experienced radiologists analyzed T2-weighted images alone and in combination with DWI in consensus and rated the likelihood of ECE on a five-point scale. Tumor ADC values were measured, and the results were compared between patients with and without ECE.Of the 456 sectors studied, 74 (16%) were positive for ECE in 31 patients. For prediction of ECE, the specificity and accuracy of combined T2-weighted imaging and DWI were 94.5% and 91.7%, respectively, superior to those of T2-weighted imaging alone (87.2% and 81.2%, respectively) (p < 0.001). On receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve (Az) of combined T2-weighted imaging and DWI (Az = 0.900) was significantly greater than that of T2-weighted imaging alone (Az = 0.828) (p < 0.001). The mean tumor ADC values were significantly lower in patients with ECE than patients without ECE (p < 0.001).DWI at 3 T in addition to T2-weighted imaging improves the ability to predict ECE in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, tumor ADC values in patients with and without ECE are significantly different.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660705","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.503424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.441833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.252436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.147825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Driving under the influence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"List of Torchwood creatures and aliens","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Torchwood_creatures_and_aliens"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.0267206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Coil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coil"},{"name":"828","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/828"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Electronic engineering","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_engineering"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Continuing education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_education"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
