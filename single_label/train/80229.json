{"id":80229,"title":"Estimation of recent and long-term malaria transmission in a population by antibody testing to multiple Plasmodium falciparum antigens.","abstract":"Tools that estimate recent and long-term malaria transmission in a population would be highly useful for malaria elimination programs.The prevalence of antibodies to 11 Plasmodium falciparum antigens was assessed by cytometric bead assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 1000 people in a highland area of Kenya over 14 months, during a period of interrupted malaria transmission.Antibodies differed by antigen in acquisition with age: rapid (>80% antibody positive by age 20 years, 5 antigens), moderate (>40% positive by age 20 years, 3 antigens), or slow (<40% positive by age 20 years, 3 antigens). Antibody seroreversion rates in the 14 months between samples decreased with age rapidly (7 antigens), slowly (3 antigens), or remained high at all ages (schizont extract). Estimated antibody half-lives in individuals >10 years of age were long (40 to >80 years) for 5 antigens, moderate (5-20 years) for 3 antigens, and short (<1 year) for 3 antigens.Antibodies to P. falciparum antigens in malaria-endemic areas vary by age, antigen, and time since last exposure to P. falciparum. Multiplex P. falciparum antibody testing could provide estimates of long-term and recent malaria transmission and potentially of a population's susceptibility to future clinical malaria.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24737801","annotations":[{"name":"Kenya","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.798873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.702255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.541354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.433195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.266395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Scotland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Multiplex (assay)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_(assay)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
