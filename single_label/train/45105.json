{"id":45105,"title":"Telaprevir in treatment of recurrent hepatitis C infection in liver transplant recipients.","abstract":"Recurrent hepatitis C infection leads to accelerated graft loss in liver transplant recipients. Telaprevir offers a higher chance of cure in these patients. We sought to assess the effectiveness of telaprevir in treatment of hepatitis C in liver transplant recipients.We report a series of 17 patients who received telaprevir for recurrent hepatitis C virus infection. These patients were previous treatment failures including 10 null responders. All patients received pegylated interferon alpha 2a (180 ?g/wk) and ribavirin (800 mg/d) for 1 year and telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours for 12 weeks. The immunosuppressive regimen was not changed during therapy, but the dosages were modified based on serum levels of the drugs.In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall sustained virologic response 12 was 58%, with a relapse rate of 24%. Nine patients (52%) achieved extended rapid virologic response. Seven patients (77%) with extended rapid virologic response achieved sustained virologic response 12. Four patients (40%), who were previous null responders to interferon and ribavirin also achieved sustained virologic response 12. Anemia and ribavirin dosage reduction were common. Severe thrombocytopenia was seen in 2 patients resulting in discontinuation of therapy. A tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen could be continued with close monitoring. During the initial 4 weeks of therapy, there were wide fluctuations in tacrolimus levels. However, after 4 weeks, tacrolimus could be dosed weekly maintaining a trough level of 3 to 10 ng/mL.Telaprevir can be used effectively in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression. Sustained virologic response 12 can be achieved in a significant number of these \"difficult-to-treat\" patients.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702143","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.743227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.725677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Interferon type I","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.613286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.48297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.265412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.0550795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
