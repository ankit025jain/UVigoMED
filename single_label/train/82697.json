{"id":82697,"title":"Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of burning mouth syndrome.","abstract":"Patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) are frequently treated with antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used. Nonetheless, few studies have examined the effects of SSRIs in BMS.We performed a retrospective study to confirm the need for a prospective study on this topic in the future.51 patients suffering from primary BMS were included in this study.The frequency of side effects due to SSRIs was low, with mainly digestive side effects. Treatment with SSRIs was more efficient in patients reporting a psychogenic origin for their symptoms. Antidepressants were more frequently stopped when patients did not declare such an origin.SSRIs appear to be effective and well tolerated. Declaring a psychogenic component may be considered as a potentiating or predictive factor for the efficacy of treatment with SSRIs. These results should be confirmed by a prospective randomised study.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557331","annotations":[{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.695495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.48582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.443093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.37894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Glossodynia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossodynia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Psychosomatic medicine","weight":0.0172523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Bristol-Myers Squibb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol-Myers_Squibb"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
