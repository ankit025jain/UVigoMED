{"id":85598,"title":"Decreased tumour necrosis factor-? production by monocytes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.","abstract":"We hypothesized that monocytes in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) are polarized towards alternative activation with decreased tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-? production and that tissue-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in granulomatous GPA lesions express CD163, a marker of alternative macrophage activation.CD16+ monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were quantified by flow cytometry. Monocytes were stimulated with increasing concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and TNF-? production was measured at 4 and 24 h. CD163 expression in lung biopsies of patients with GPA was detected by immunohistochemistry.Circulating CD16+ monocytes were more frequent in GPA patients compared to controls (4.7 ± 2.8% vs. 1.9 ± 1.2%, p < 0.001). Upon activation with LPS, TNF-? production did not differ between CD16+ and CD16- monocytes. Stimulated monocytes from GPA patients produced significantly less TNF-? compared with monocytes from healthy controls (2903 ± 1320 pg/mL vs. 8335 ± 4569 pg/mL, p < 0.001). Macrophages expressing CD163 were enriched in granulomatous lung lesions of GPA patients.Decreased TNF-? production by circulating monocytes and CD163 overexpression by tissue monocytes/macrophages in granulomatous pulmonary lesions may suggest that monocytes/macrophages are alternatively activated in GPA.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898149","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.558329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.501002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"CD16","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD16"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
