{"id":4768,"title":"Measles outbreak registered by the District Sanitary-Epidemiological Station in Cz?stochowa in 2013.","abstract":"Since 2001, Poland has been committed to measles elimination programme coordinated by the World Health Organization. This programme is intended to sustain 95% coverage with measles vaccines and ensure laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases. In 2013, a total of 89 measles cases were reported in Poland. Of them, 14 cases were notified to the District Sanitary-Epidemiological Station (DSES) in Cz?stochowa. PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological situation of measles in Cz?stochowa with focus on the increase in measles incidence observed in the second quarter of 2013.To analyze the epidemiological situation of measles, the reports on the cases of infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2000-2013 (MZ-56) from the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH-NIH) and Cz?stochowa DSES were employed. The analysis of immunization coverage of children and adolescents in selected year groups in 2009-2012 was performed using the data retrieved from annual reports issued by Cz?stochowa DSES (MZ-54).In 2000-2012, three cases of measles were notified to Cz?stochowa DSES. Of them, two cases and one case were reported in 2003 and 2011, respectively. In 2013, an increase in the number of measles cases and measles incidence was observed. A total of 14 adult cases, aged 22-38 years, were reported and the incidence was 3.78 per 100,000. Of them, 13 cases were males (93% of the total). The infection affected 8 inmates of the Day Care Centre in Cz?stochowa, 2 individuals who lived near this institution and 4 individuals who were not epidemiologically linked to the outbreak. Of the cases, 12 individuals were hospitalized, i.e. 86% of all cases. Of 14 reported cases, only one individual had a history of measles vaccination.Measles remains a highly infectious disease which can be easily transmitted in the unvaccinated population.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25391003","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Measles","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.696382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"MMR vaccine","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.417848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.305722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"History","weight":0.277566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Day care","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_care"},{"name":"Prison","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Government of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Academic term","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}]}
