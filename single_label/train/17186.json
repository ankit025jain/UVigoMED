{"id":17186,"title":"Serum concentrations of cycloserine and outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Northern Taiwan.","abstract":"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been advocated to promote the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis agents. Cycloserine (CS) is a second-line anti-tuberculosis drug whose serum concentrations in tuberculosis (TB) patients are largely unknown.To investigate serum CS concentrations after drug ingestion in TB patients.Multidrug-resistant TB patients who were taking CS in a tertiary care centre in northern Taiwan between 1 April 2009 and 31 October 2009 were enrolled in the study. Serum CS concentrations were measured at 2 and 6 h after drug administration.Of 32 patients enrolled, 23 were males and 9 females. The mean CS dose was 8.8 ± 1.3 mg/kg. The mean serum concentrations at 2 and 6 h were respectively 19.7 ± 8.3 and 18.1 ± 8.7 ?g/ml. Seven patients (22%) had serum drug concentrations that were higher at 6 h than at 2 h, 12 (38%) had peak serum concentrations within the recommended range of 20-35 ?g/ml; 18 patients (56%) had concentrations <20 ?g/ml at both 2 h and 6 h; and 2 patients (6%) had at least one measurement >35 ?g/ml.Lower than recommended serum CS concentrations and delayed absorption were common. It is essential to develop practical TDM to maintain proper serum drug concentrations.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903799","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.892072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.616713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.595204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.475559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Middle Low German","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Low_German"},{"name":"Time-division multiplexing","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"},{"name":"Therapeutic drug monitoring","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_drug_monitoring"},{"name":"Cycloserine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloserine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Northern Hemisphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2035","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2035"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
