{"id":88079,"title":"Treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures through short segment pedicle screw fixation techniques using pedicle fixation at the level of the fracture: a finite element analysis.","abstract":"To compare the von Mises stresses of the internal fixation devices among different short segment pedicle screw fixation techniques to treat thoracic 12 vertebral fractures, especially the mono-segment pedicle screw fixation and intermediate unilateral pedicle screw fixation techniques.Finite element methods were utilised to investigate the biomechanical comparison of the four posterior short segment pedicle screw fixation techniques (S4+2: traditional short-segment 4 pedicle screw fixation [SPSF]; M4+2: mono-segment pedicle screw fixation; I6+2: intermediate bilateral pedicle screw fixation; and I5+2: intermediate unilateral pedicle screw fixation).The range of motion (ROM) in flexion, axial rotation, and lateral bending was the smallest in the I6+2 fixation model, followed by the I5+2 and S4+2 fixation models, but lateral bending was the largest in the M4+2 fixation model. The maximal stress of the upper pedicle screw is larger than the lower pedicle screw in S4+2 and M4+2. The largest maximal von Mises stress was observed in the upper pedicle screw in the S4+2 and M4+2 fixation models and in the lower pedicle screw in the I6+2 and I5+2 fixation models. The values of the largest maximal von Mises stress of the pedicle screws and rods during all states of motion were 263.1 MPa and 304.5 MPa in the S4+2 fixation model, 291.6 MPa and 340.5 MPa in the M4+2 fixation model, 182.9 MPa and 263.2 MPa in the I6+2 fixation model, and 269.3 MPa and 383.7 MPa in the I5+2 fixation model, respectively. Comparing the stress between different spinal loadings, the maximal von Mises stress of the implants were observed in flexion in all implanted models.Additional bilateral pedicle screws at the level of the fracture to SPSF may result in a stiffer construct and less von Mises stress for pedicle screws and rods. The largest maximal von Mises stress of the pedicle screws during all states of motion were observed in the mono-segment pedicle screw fixation technique.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914815","annotations":[{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.819453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Finite element method","weight":0.723411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.695781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.473099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.238155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.211175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"M42 motorway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M42_motorway"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Von Mises yield criterion","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises_yield_criterion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"304","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/304"},{"name":"291","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/291"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"Fishing rod","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_rod"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Von Mises","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Read-only memory","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory"},{"name":"Finite set","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"S4X (Berlin)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S4X_(Berlin)"}]}
