{"id":22741,"title":"[Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of tigecycline for treatment of respiratory tract infections: systematic review of literature].","abstract":"Tigecycline is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin infections, soft tissue and intraabdominal infections. Its use could be extended to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital pneumonia (HN). The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tigecycline in the treatment of respiratory infections.systematic review (2012). Databases used were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CRD and WOK. We identified clinical trials of adults with respiratory infection, treated with tigecycline. The quality of the studies was assessed using CASPe checklist.We selected four clinical trials of high-moderate quality. Three studies with patients with CAP and a trial with HN patients. In patients with CAP, efficacy of tigecycline (88.6 to 90.6%) was higher than levofloxacin (85.3 to 87.2%). The non inferiority testing was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In the study of patients with HN tigecycline showed an efficiency of 67.9% versus 78.2% for imipenem/cilastatin. Main adverse effects were gastrointestinal.The efficacy of tigecycline is non inferior than levofloxacin in patients with CAP, but less than imipenem in patients with HN. Tigecycline demonstrates noninferiority versus others tested antibiotics, and it shows a good safety profile.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522299","annotations":[{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.82729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Levofloxacin","weight":0.680323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.591328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.570183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.26547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.235741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Tigecycline","weight":0.194746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigecycline"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.155226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complicated skin and skin structure infection","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complicated_skin_and_skin_structure_infection"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
