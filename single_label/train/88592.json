{"id":88592,"title":"Metatarsal artery perforator-based propeller flap.","abstract":"Soft-tissue defects of the distal foot that involve an exposed tendon and bone demonstrate a reconstructive challenge for plastic surgeons. This report investigates the feasibility and reliability of metatarsal artery perforator (MAP)-based propeller flap for reconstruction of the distal foot soft-tissue defects. Between July 2011 and June 2012, six patients underwent distal foot reconstruction with seven MAP-based propeller flaps. Five flaps were based on the third metatarsal artery and two flaps were based on the first metatarsal artery. The flap size ranged from 4 × 2 cm to 8 × 4 cm. All flaps completely survived. Two patients developed transient distal venous congestion, which subsided spontaneously without complications. There were no donor site complications. All patients were ambulating without difficulty within the first month of surgery. MAP-based propeller flaps can be used to repair the distal foot soft-tissue defects, providing sufficient skin territory and excellent esthetic and functional recovery.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822254","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.282608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.256232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.252692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.249917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Venous stasis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_stasis"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Adam Politzer","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Politzer"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Traffic congestion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"},{"name":"Third metatarsal bone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_metatarsal_bone"},{"name":"First metatarsal bone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_metatarsal_bone"}]}
