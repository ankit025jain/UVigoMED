{"id":88527,"title":"[The initial management in intensive care of pelvic ring injury patients].","abstract":"Pelvic trauma care is complex since it is frequently associated with multiple injuries and may lead to dramatic and uncontrollable haemorrhage. After pelvic trauma, the mortality, around 8 to 10%, is mainly related to severe pelvic hemorrhage but also to extrapelvic injuries (thoracic, abdominal or brain injuries). It is therefore crucial to manage pelvic trauma in specialized trauma center. The initial trauma assessment aims to determine the role of the pelvic injury in hemorrhage to define the therapeutic strategy of pelvic trauma care (arterial embolisation/pelvic ring stabilisation). This review was performed with a systematic review of the literature; it describes the pelvic fracture pathophysiology, and the efficacy and safety of haemostatic procedures and with their respective indications. A decision making algorithm is proposed for the treatment of trauma patients with pelvic fracture.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833399","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.751478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.691795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.614821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.562772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.509911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.335847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.308091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.147531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.110572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Pelvic fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_fracture"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"}]}
