{"id":76737,"title":"The genetics of human obesity.","abstract":"The heritability of obesity has long been appreciated and the genetics of obesity has been the focus of intensive study for decades. Early studies elucidating genetic factors involved in rare monogenic and syndromic forms of extreme obesity focused attention on dysfunction of hypothalamic leptin-related pathways in the control of food intake as a major contributor. Subsequent genome-wide association studies of common genetic variants identified novel loci that are involved in more common forms of obesity across populations of diverse ethnicities and ages. The subsequent search for factors contributing to the heritability of obesity not explained by these 2 approaches (\"missing heritability\") has revealed additional rare variants, copy number variants, and epigenetic changes that contribute. Although clinical applications of these findings have been limited to date, the increasing understanding of the interplay of these genetic factors with environmental conditions, such as the increased availability of high calorie foods and decreased energy expenditure of sedentary lifestyles, promises to accelerate the translation of genetic findings into more successful preventive and therapeutic interventions.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929207","annotations":[{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.621094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.563904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.477373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.296406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.262149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Basal metabolic rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"}]}
