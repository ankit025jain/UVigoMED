{"id":18252,"title":"Evaluation of an interactive surveillance system for monitoring acute bacterial infections in Nigeria.","abstract":"The objective of the study is to evaluate the usability of a stand-alone, Internet-enabled interactive surveillance system designed to monitor the burden of invasive bacterial infections among children in Nigeria.A convenience sample of 10 participants were enrolled in a training session on using the system at a hospital in Nigeria. The participants performed a series of tasks assessing their ability to use the system. System usability was assessed using a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire.The majority of participants found the system easy to use (90 percent; n = 9) and reported confidence in using the system. The average SUS score was 77.8. A total of 30 percent (n = 3) of the study participants had exceptional usability scores, 20 percent (n = 2) showed acceptable scores, and 10 percent (n = 1) had a good score.Further evaluation of the system will help gauge additional challenges during its long-term utilization. If successful, the system could also be deployed in other resource poor-environments.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808807","annotations":[{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.227504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"System Usability Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Usability_Scale"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Interactivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"}]}
