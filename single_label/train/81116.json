{"id":81116,"title":"Polymorphism of the merozoite surface protein-1 block 2 region in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Mauritania.","abstract":"The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum has been extensively studied in various parts of the world. However, limited data are available from Mauritania. The present study examined and compared the genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates in Mauritania.Plasmodium falciparum isolates blood samples were collected from 113 patients attending health facilities in Nouakchott and Hodh El Gharbi regions. K1, Mad20 and RO33 allelic family of msp-1 gene were determined by nested PCR amplification.K1 family was the predominant allelic type carried alone or in association with Ro33 and Mad20 types (90%; 102/113). Out of the 113 P. falciparum samples, 93(82.3%) harboured more than one parasite genotype. The overall multiplicity of infection was 3.2 genotypes per infection. There was no significant correlation between multiplicity of infection and age of patients. A significant increase of multiplicity of infection was correlated with parasite densities.The polymorphism of P. falciparum populations from Mauritania was high. Infection with multiple P. falciparum clones was observed, as well as a high multiplicity of infection reflecting both the high endemicity level and malaria transmission in Mauritania.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456636","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.791143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.761983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.754053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.719448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.515136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.408928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.393729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.361956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.320925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.247438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.164836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mauritania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania"},{"name":"Multiplicity of infection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_of_infection"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Eigenvalues and eigenvectors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"}]}
