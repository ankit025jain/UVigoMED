{"id":21917,"title":"Chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine-impregnated venous catheters save costs.","abstract":"Previous cost-effectiveness analyses have found that the use of chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine (CHSS)-impregnated catheters is associated with decreased catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and central venous catheter (CVC)-related costs. However, in these analyses, the CVC-related cost included the increase of hospital stay.Our aim was to determine the immediate CVC-related cost (including only the cost of CVC, diagnosis of CRBSI, and antimicrobials for the treatment of CRBSI) of using a CHSS or a standard catheter in internal jugular venous access.We performed a prospective, observational, cohort study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), Hospital Universitario de Canarias (Tenerife, Spain), who received 1 or more internal jugular venous catheters.The study included 245 CHSS-impregnated catheters and 391 standard catheters. Exact logistic regression analysis showed that CHSS-impregnated catheters were associated with a lower incidence of CRBSI, controlling for catheter duration, than standard catheters (0 vs 5.04 CRBSI per 1,000 catheter-days, respectively; odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval: 0.712-0.898; P < .001). Poisson regression showed that CHSS-impregnated catheters were associated with lower CVC-related cost per day than standard catheters (€3.78 ± €4.45 vs €7.28 ± €16.71, respectively; odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.504-0.535; P < .001). Survival analysis showed that CHSS-impregnated catheters were associated with increased CRBSI-free time compared with standard catheters (?(2) = 14.9; P < .001).The use of CHSS-impregnated catheters reduced the incidence of CRBSI and immediate CVC-related costs in the internal jugular venous access.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581021","annotations":[{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.770513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.711032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.614799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.544786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.525504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.516559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Peripheral venous catheter","weight":0.111259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tenerife","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife"},{"name":"Sulfadiazine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfadiazine"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"535","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/535"},{"name":"898","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/898"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Save (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)"},{"name":"Universitario de Deportes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universitario_de_Deportes"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Internal jugular vein","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_jugular_vein"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"'Allo 'Allo!
