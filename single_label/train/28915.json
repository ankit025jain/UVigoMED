{"id":28915,"title":"Ibuprofen dependence: a case report.","abstract":"Ibuprofen is currently widely prescribed and has not been reported to produce dependence. We report the case of a 17-year old patient who presented many positive psychic symptoms related to a pharmacological dependence. During the treatment, she adjusted herself posology as she developed withdrawal symptoms. Pharmacological evidences (effect on COX-1 and COX-2, FAAH and PPARs) allow us to formulate hypotheses explaining this effect.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764198","annotations":[{"name":"Ibuprofen","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.621052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.143318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor"},{"name":"Psychic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
