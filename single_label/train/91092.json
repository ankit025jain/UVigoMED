{"id":91092,"title":"The management of traumatic scalp pseudoaneurysms with manual or US-guided compression.","abstract":"There are many reports dealing with the treatment of traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the scalp. But, there is no consistent standard of treatment for such lesions, to our knowledge. We reviewed our cases and evaluated the use of manual or ultrasonography (US)-guided compression as a treatment option for patients with traumatic scalp pseudoaneurysm. Four patients with traumatic pseudoaneurysm were enrolled in this study. Among them, three patients underwent manual or US-guided compression (mean size = 5.67 mm) and all the lesions were resolved. In one case, a residual lesion (size = 10 mm) remained after surgical operation (initial size = 20 mm). The lesion regressed after the patient was treated with US-guided compression. Overall, in this study population, four patients (mean = 6.75 mm) were treated with manual or US-guided compression. Although there were only a small number of patients in this study, all the traumatic scalp pseudoaneurysms were treated successfully. We recommend manual or US-guided compression for the treatment of these lesions. Further studies involving a larger number of patients and comparisons with surgical and endovascular data are needed.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552258","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.220123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75_mm_Gun_M2/M3/M6"},{"name":"20 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0141339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"}]}
