{"id":86812,"title":"Natural A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus infection case in a pet ferret in Taiwan.","abstract":"Ferrets have demonstrated high susceptibility to the influenza virus. This study discusses a natural 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (A(H1N1)pdm09) virus infection in a pet ferret (Mustela putorius furo) identified in Taiwan in 2013. The ferret was in close contact with family members who had recently experienced an influenza-like illness (ILI). The ferret nasal swab showed positive results for influenza A virus using one-step RT-PCR. The virus was isolated and the phylogenetic analysis indicated that all of the eight segmented genes were closely related to the human A(H1N1)pdm09 virus linage isolated in Taiwan. This study may provide a perspective view on natural influenza A virus transmission from the local human population into pet ferrets.","date":"2015-01-19","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25597188","annotations":[{"name":"Ferret","weight":0.845478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H1N1","weight":0.812212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.778778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Influenza pandemic","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_pandemic"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.656014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"2009 flu pandemic","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Influenza-like illness","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.461754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.368165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Weasel","weight":0.362924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.319308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.159055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.122553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pet","weight":0.0719954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"European Polecat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Polecat"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
