{"id":50325,"title":"[Differential diagnosis of primary aldosteronism by measurement of hybrid steroids using mass spectrometry].","abstract":"Primary aldosteronism (PA), characterized by the autonomous hypersecretion of aldosterone, is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Patients with PA have a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity than essential hypertension. The two common subtypes of PA, aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA), should be differentiated, because the former is an indication for adrenalectomy, and the latter is treated by medication. 18-Hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol, known as hybrid steroids, have been recognized as markers for the differentiation of aldosterone-producing adenoma and rare glucocorticoid remediable hyperaldosteronism from other subtypes of PA. Hybrid steroids have been measured using immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunoassays; however, immunoassays for hybrid steroids are not widely used. Recently, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for hybrid steroids was developed. The ability to measure hybrid steroids using LC-MS/MS will be useful for the differential diagnosis of subtypes of PA.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800505","annotations":[{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Primary aldosteronism","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_aldosteronism"},{"name":"Aldosterone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Secondary hypertension","weight":0.726513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_hypertension"},{"name":"Essential hypertension","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_hypertension"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.694473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hyperaldosteronism","weight":0.467515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaldosteronism"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.294086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"American Psychological Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
