{"id":3849,"title":"PRC2 loss amplifies Ras signaling in cancer.","abstract":"The histone-modifying PRC2 complex has an ambiguous role in cancer, bearing both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive features depending on cell type. Studies of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) have now identified loss-of-function mutations altering PRC2 subunits, leading to the amplification of Ras-driven transcription and conferring vulnerability to BRD4 inhibitors.
