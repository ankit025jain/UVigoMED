{"id":24651,"title":"Hybrid procedure.","abstract":"With increase in aging population and increased prevalance of coronary risk factors including diabetes mellitus, more people with multivessel coronary artery disease are diagnosed. Many of these patients undergo coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery (CABG). Hybrid coronary revascularisation may be preferred in multivessel CAD patients with technical limitations to PCI or CABG and in whom minimising invasiveness of CABG is preferred. Our case highlights patient selection and procedure for this new modality of coronary artery disease treatment.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25327071","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.769292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.54691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.338135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.134583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"}]}
