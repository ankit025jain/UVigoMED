{"id":44547,"title":"Abnormal FHIT protein expression may be correlated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Our current meta-analysis is aimed to investigate the relationships between fragile histidine triad (FHIT) protein expression and prognosis in gastric cancer patients. We searched MEDLINE (1966 ~ 2013), the Cochrane Library Database (Issue 12, 2013), EMBASE (1980 ~ 2013), CINAHL (1982 ~ 2013), Web of Science (1945 ~ 2013), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1982 ~ 2013) without any language restrictions. The meta-analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. Crude hazard ratios (HR) with its 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were calculated. Eight clinical cohort studies with a total of 1,361 gastric cancer patients were involved in our meta-analysis. Our results revealed that FHIT-negative patients exhibited a shorter overall survival (OS) time than FHIT-positive patients (HR = 1.23, 95 % CI = 1.01 ~ 1.44, P < 0.001). Ethnicity-stratified analysis demonstrated that FHIT-negative patients have significantly poorer prognosis than FHIT-positive patients among both Caucasians and Asians (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, our meta-analysis provides evidences that negative expression of FHIT protein may be correlated with poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. Thus, FHIT expression level may be utilized as an independent prognostic marker for gastric cancer.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System
