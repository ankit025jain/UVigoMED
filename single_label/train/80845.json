{"id":80845,"title":"Foxp3? regulatory T cells delay expulsion of intestinal nematodes by suppression of IL-9-driven mast cell activation in BALB/c but not in C57BL/6 mice.","abstract":"Accumulating evidence suggests that IL-9-mediated immunity plays a fundamental role in control of intestinal nematode infection. Here we report a different impact of Foxp3? regulatory T cells (Treg) in nematode-induced evasion of IL-9-mediated immunity in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Infection with Strongyloides ratti induced Treg expansion with similar kinetics and phenotype in both strains. Strikingly, Treg depletion reduced parasite burden selectively in BALB/c but not in C57BL/6 mice. Treg function was apparent in both strains as Treg depletion increased nematode-specific humoral and cellular Th2 response in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice to the same extent. Improved resistance in Treg-depleted BALB/c mice was accompanied by increased production of IL-9 and accelerated degranulation of mast cells. In contrast, IL-9 production was not significantly elevated and kinetics of mast cell degranulation were unaffected by Treg depletion in C57BL/6 mice. By in vivo neutralization, we demonstrate that increased IL-9 production during the first days of infection caused accelerated mast cell degranulation and rapid expulsion of S. ratti adults from the small intestine of Treg-depleted BALB/c mice. In genetically mast cell-deficient (Cpa3-Cre) BALB/c mice, Treg depletion still resulted in increased IL-9 production but resistance to S. ratti infection was lost, suggesting that IL-9-driven mast cell activation mediated accelerated expulsion of S. ratti in Treg-depleted BALB/c mice. This IL-9-driven mast cell degranulation is a central mechanism of S. ratti expulsion in both, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, because IL-9 injection reduced and IL-9 neutralization increased parasite burden in the presence of Treg in both strains. Therefore our results suggest that Foxp3? Treg suppress sufficient IL-9 production for subsequent mast cell degranulation during S. ratti infection in a non-redundant manner in BALB/c mice, whereas additional regulatory pathways are functional in Treg-depleted C57BL/6 mice.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516385","annotations":[{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Degranulation","weight":0.768396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degranulation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.735016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.689765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.668418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.394167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.160174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Strongyloides stercoralis","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongyloides_stercoralis"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Neutralization (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralization_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
