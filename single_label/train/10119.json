{"id":10119,"title":"Effect of epicatechin gallate dietary supplementation on transgenic Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and aggregation of alpha synuclein (?S) in the brain. The role of epicatechin gallate (EG) was studied on the transgenic Drosophila model of flies expressing normal human alpha synuclein (h-?S) in the neurons. The objectives of the present work include the study of the effect of EG on the climbing ability, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis in the brain of PD model flies. These flies exhibit locomotor dysfunction as the age progresses. EG at final concentration of 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 ?g/mL was supplemented in diet and flies were allowed to feed for 24 days. The climbing ability was assessed after 24 days. The supplementation of 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 ?g/mL of EG showed a dose-dependent significant delay in the loss of climbing ability and reduced the oxidative stress and apoptosis in the brain of PD model flies.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670116","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.741106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Drosophila","weight":0.662418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.495274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Catechin","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechin"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.326489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Synuclein","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synuclein"},{"name":"Gallic acid","weight":0.21971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_acid"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Fly","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Climbing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
