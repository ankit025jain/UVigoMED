{"id":56034,"title":"Lysyl oxidase-like 2 level and glaucoma surgical outcomes.","abstract":"To evaluate the levels of TGF-? and lysyl oxidases in both the aqueous humor and in Tenon's tissue in patients with POAG, and to assess their association with bleb morphological features and outcomes of glaucoma surgery.Eighteen POAG patients scheduled to undergo glaucoma surgery and 17 healthy controls were enrolled. At the time of surgery, approximately 0.1 mL aqueous humor through an anterior chamber paracentesis and a 4 Ã— 4-mm sample of Tenon's tissue were obtained. Concentrations of TGF-? and lysyl oxidases (types 1 and 2) were analyzed by ELISA. The bleb morphologic features based on the Moorfields Bleb Grading System were evaluated by bleb photographs.The TGF-? in Tenon's tissue and lysyl oxidase-like 2 in aqueous humor and in Tenon's tissue were significantly elevated in POAG patients. When POAG patients were divided by outcome 1 year after surgery, lysyl oxidase-like 2 protein was significantly higher in both aqueous humor and Tenon's tissue of the failure group. The level of lysyl oxidase-like 2 protein was significantly correlated with that of TGF-? in the Tenon's tissue. Lysyl oxidase-like 2 level in the aqueous humor (r = 0.563, P < 0.001) and Tenon's tissue (r = 0.760, P < 0.001) had significantly negative correlation with bleb area.The TGF-? and lysyl oxidase-like 2 levels at the time of surgery were significantly correlated with 1-year outcomes of glaucoma surgery. The level of lysyl oxidase-like 2 was significantly correlated with that of TGF-?, suggesting induction by TGF-?. Modulation of lysyl oxidase-like 2 levels may have important applications in glaucoma surgery.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764069","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.47749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.327004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.305179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.171135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.110579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Aqueous humour","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Moorfields","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorfields"},{"name":"Paracentesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracentesis"},{"name":"Bleb (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleb_(medicine)"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Humour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour"},{"name":"Electromagnetic induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Tetragonal crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Glaucoma surgery","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma_surgery"}]}
