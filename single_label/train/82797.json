{"id":82797,"title":"Side-to-end hypoglossal to facial anastomosis with transposition of the intratemporal facial nerve.","abstract":"To describe results in a large series of patients using a recent variation of hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HFA) in which the intratemporal facial nerve segment is used, obviating the need for a sensory nerve \"jump graft.\"Retrospective chart review.Tertiary neurotologic referral center.Nineteen patients (12 female/7 male subjects) with facial paralysis because of posterior fossa surgery for tumor (n = 15), Bell's palsy (n = 1), facial neuroma (n = 1), hemangioma (n = 1), and trauma (n = 1) who underwent HFA from 1997 to 2011, with at least 1-year follow-up. Mean age at surgery is 47.4 years (range, 11.2-83 yr). Mean follow-up is 4.0 years.Side-to-end hypoglossal to facial anastomosis with transposition of the intratemporal facial nerve (swingdown HFA).House-Brackmann (H-B) facial nerve grade.Seven patients (36.8%) achieved an H-B Grade III, 9 patients (47.4%) a grade IV, and 3 patients (15.8%) a grade V at last follow-up. No patients complained of dysphagia, dysarthria, or had evidence of oral incompetence. One patient complained of mild tongue weakness. Age at time of HFA (p ? 0.049, III younger than V) and time from facial nerve injury to HFA (p ? 0.02, III<IV and V) were significant factors for ultimate facial nerve outcome. All patients with an H-B III result had HFA within 6 months of injury. Other factors were not significant.The HFA swingdown technique is a safe and effective method to restore facial nerve function in patients with facial paralysis and obviates the need for an interposition jump graft.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Stomatognathic
