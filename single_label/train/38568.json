{"id":38568,"title":"Sinonasal alterations in computed tomography scans in cystic fibrosis: a literature review of observational studies.","abstract":"Almost all cystic fibrosis (CF) patients reveal upper airway involvement in computed tomography (CT) scans. Sinonasal pathology has become a challenging issue because there are few studies to guide appropriate management. The objective of this study was to provide information about paranasal sinus CT manifestations in CF patients, mainly in adulthood.We performed a literature review of descriptive studies about CT sinonasal findings in CF patients using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, LILACS, Scielo, and Cochrane.Eighteen articles were included in this review. There was a high variability in methodological aspects for most of the studies. The most prevalent findings reported were opacification of sinuses, presence of frontal and sphenoidal aplasia or hypoplasia, underdevelopment of paranasal sinuses, and medial bulging of the lateral nasal wall in CT scans.There are few studies in the CF adult population regarding sinonasal CT alterations. Many studies report specific pathological features in CF upper airways that could help in the diagnosis of doubtful cases.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415497","annotations":[{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.829592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.750234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.577722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.482972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract","weight":0.384092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Sinus (anatomy)","weight":0.273608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.261898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.138135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Frontal bone","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_bone"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
