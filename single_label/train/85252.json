{"id":85252,"title":"Satisfaction level and asthma control among Malaysian asthma patients on Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART) in the primary care setting (SMARTEST study).","abstract":"To evaluate Malaysian patients' satisfaction levels and asthma control with Symbicort SMARTÂ® in the primary care setting.This is a cross-sectional, multicentre study involving adult patients with persistent asthma who were prescribed only Symbicort SMART in the preceding one month prior to recruitment. Patients' satisfaction with Symbicort SMART and asthma control were evaluated using the self-administered Satisfaction with Asthma Treatment Questionnaire (SATQ) and the Asthma Control Test (ACT).Asthma was controlled (ACT score >20) in 189 (83%) of 228 patients. The mean overall SATQ score for patients with controlled asthma was 5.65 indicating a high satisfaction level, which was positively correlated with high ACT scores. There were differences in asthma control based on ethnicity, number of unscheduled visits and treatment compliance.Symbicort SMART resulted in a high satisfaction level and asthma control among Malaysian patients treated in the primary care setting and it is an effective and appealing treatment for asthmatic patients.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25003728","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.441807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.239537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.167091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.163271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Budesonide/formoterol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budesonide/formoterol"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Controlled Substances Act","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/189"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Relief pitcher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher"},{"name":"ACT (test)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_(test)"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
