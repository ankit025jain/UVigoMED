{"id":81528,"title":"[Morphological and radiological features of unilateral class II malocclusion].","abstract":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the asymmetry of dentition, mandible and bite features in adult patients with unilateral class II malocclusion. The study revealed that class II malocclusion is associated rather with an asymmetrical shift of the mandible to the side with distal molars relation than with absolute dentoalveolar anomaly.
