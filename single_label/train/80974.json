{"id":80974,"title":"[Endemic situation of schistosomiasis after transmission-interrupted in debao county: a 25-year surveillance].","abstract":"To understand the dynamics of schistosomiasis prevalent factors after the transmission interruption in Debao Country, so as to provide the evidence for establishing a control strategy.By using the system sample method combined with environmental sample method, the Oncomelania hupensis snail situation was surveyed through the general survey, round survey and selection check. Schistosomiasis cases were detected from local population and floating population by serological tests and stool tests.Four residual snail foci were found in a village from 1988 to 1991, covering an area of 1024 m2, and 853 snails were dissected but no positive snail was discovered. No schistosomiasis patient was detected among 42,641 persons. No positive was found from 3165 cattle and 2063 wild mice.The schistosomiasis situation is stable in Debao County, but the surveillance of schistosomiasis still should be continued.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490374","annotations":[{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.817506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.610685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.325848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.280424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.145721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Debao County","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debao_County"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"1988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988"},{"name":"1991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991"},{"name":"853","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/853"},{"name":"641","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/641"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"1024","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1024"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"2060s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060s"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"Migration in the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"}]}
