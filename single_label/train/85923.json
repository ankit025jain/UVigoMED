{"id":85923,"title":"Phase II study of zoledronic acid combined with docetaxel for non-small-cell lung cancer: West Japan Oncology Group.","abstract":"The aim of this open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in combination with docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bone metastases. In this study, patients randomly received docetaxel (60 mg/m(2) ) with (group DZ) or without (group D) zoledronic acid every 21 days. There were 50 patients in each group, and the primary endpoint was progression-free survival. In an efficacy analysis of 94 patients (DZ, 48; D, 46), the median progression-free survival was 2.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-3.5 months) for the DZ group and 2.6 months (95% CI, 1.5-3.4 months) for the D group (stratified log-rank test, P = 0.89). The median overall survival was 10.4 months (95% CI, 7.0-15.8 months) for the DZ group and 9.7 months (95% CI, 6.1-12.5 months) for the D group (stratified log-rank test, P = 0.62). There were no clinically relevant differences in the frequencies of grade 3 or 4 adverse events between the two groups. No treatment-related deaths occurred in the DZ group. Zoledronic acid combined with docetaxel was well tolerated but did not meet the primary endpoint of demonstrating a longer progression-free survival in advanced NSCLC patients with bone metastases compared with docetaxel alone. This trial was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000001098).","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837137","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.822386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.663118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.581749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.54472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.528585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.38219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.333546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Zoledronic acid","weight":0.273049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoledronic_acid"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.17036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Phase II trial","weight":0.0964592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_II_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"End point of clinical trials","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_point_of_clinical_trials"},{"name":"HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Advocate_v_Sheridan_and_Sheridan"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
