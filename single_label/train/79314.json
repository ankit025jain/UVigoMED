{"id":79314,"title":"A new bone conduction implant: surgical technique and results.","abstract":"To describe the surgical technique under local or general anesthesia of 5 cases that have undergone this procedure and the audiologic results obtained with this new device.Four patients with mixed hearing loss and 1 patient with single-sided deafness.Therapeutic.The surgery was planned beforehand with a 3D reconstruction of a CT scan. The procedure was documented and timed in every case. Air and bone conductive pure tone audiometry and disyllabic words discrimination were tested after and before the procedure. Results were statistically analyzed.All patients tolerated well the procedure. Four patients were intervened under local anesthesia and 1 under general anesthesia because of an associated procedure. All patients showed statistically significant difference between the presurgery and postsurgery audiologic tests.Implantation of the Bonebridge with local or general anesthesia is a safe and feasible procedure, with audiometric results that can come close with the ones provided by BAHD users.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448280","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.733859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.716893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.694945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.449085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.335884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.0707274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Pure tone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone"},{"name":"Bone conduction","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_conduction"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Syllable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable"},{"name":"Electrical resistivity and conductivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity"},{"name":"Pitch (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"3D reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"}]}
