{"id":45862,"title":"Treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome by focusing on the liver in terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"To assess the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome by focusing on the liver.Databases (domestic and foreign) were searched with the key words \"irritable bowel syndrome'\", \"constipation\", and \"Chinese medicine\"; the relevant articles were retrieved and evaluated. Cure rate, \"remarkable efficacy\", recurrence rate and the incidence of adverse reactions were the outcome indicators. Review Manager ver 5.1 was used for this meta-analysis, and funnel plots used to deted publication bias.Nineteen randomized controlled trials were included and 1510 patients involved. The treatment guided byTCM based on the liver was superior to Western Medicine [odds ratio (OR) = 2.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80, 3.35)], cure rate [OR = 2.61, 95% Cl (1.93, 3.52)], remarkable efficacy [OR = 2.68, 95% Cl (1.82, 3.95)], recurrence rate [OR = 0.19, 95% CI (0.12, 0.29)] and the incidence of adverse reactions [OR = 0.24, 95% CI (0.09, 0.65)]. However, funnel plots showed publication bias.Compared with Western Medicine, the treatment of IBS-C based on the liver is significantly better but the results must be treated with caution because publication bias was recorded.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660576","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.733931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.633441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.573938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.510706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Number needed to treat","weight":0.358193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_needed_to_treat"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.290373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.233892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
