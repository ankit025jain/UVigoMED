{"id":61052,"title":"[Fever, atrial fibrillation, and angina pectoris in a 58-year-old man].","abstract":"Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) respresents a very rare type of cardiac tumour. This report illustrates a case of PCL in an immunocompetent 58-year-old man presenting with atrial fibrillation and febrile syndrome. Comprehensive imaging [computer tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI), 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D-TEE)] identified a large right atrial tumour, leading to pericardial effusion. Isolated cardiac involvement was confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. A diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was diagnosed based on the results of a TEE-guided biopsy. A normalized PET scan (PETAL study) indicated complete remission following R-CHOP 14 immunochemotherapy. Thus, an interdisciplinary and multimodal approach avoided unnecessary cardiac surgery.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770978","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Pericardial effusion","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardial_effusion"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.782643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.671591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.569189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.489062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.225096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"}]}
