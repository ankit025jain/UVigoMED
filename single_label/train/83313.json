{"id":83313,"title":"Clinical significance of vessel-sealing device usage for pancreatectomy: a retrospective cohort study.","abstract":"We compared each vessel-sealing device to evaluate safety and efficacy for controlling surgical results in 200 patients undergoing pancreatectomy.Sixty-seven patients applied the hemostatic devices (VS group) consisted of LigaSureâ„¢ (LS) or the Harmonic ultrasonic dissector (USD). Results were compared with that of a historical control group (n=134).In pancreaticoduodenectomy, the prevalence of lymph node dissection was high in the VS group. Blood transfusion was significantly less frequent in the VS group than in the control group (p<0.01). The prevalence of surgical site infection and systemic complications was significantly lower in the VS group than in the control group (p<0.05). The duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the VS group than in the control group (p<0.01). In distal pancreatectomy, the prevalence of cutting stapler usage for transection was low in the VS group. Postoperative weight loss and the prevalence of surgical site infections was higher in the VS group than in the control group but were more frequently observed in the USD group than in the LS group.Use of energy sealing devices improves surgical results and avoids pancreatectomy-related complications. These devices are safe and effective for use in pancreatic surgery.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436377","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.74713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.48428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.449993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.449993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.395769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.196775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.189319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
