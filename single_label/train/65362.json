{"id":65362,"title":"Human papillomavirus infection is not related with prostatitis-related symptoms: results from a case-control study.","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and prostatitis-related symptoms.All young heterosexual patients with prostatitis-related symptoms attending the same Center from January 2005 to December 2010 were eligible for this case-control study. Sexually active asymptomatic men were considered as the control group. All subjects underwent clinical examination, Meares-Stamey test and DNA-HPV test. Patients with prostatitis-related symptoms and asymptomatic men were compared in terms of HPV prevalence. Moreover, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine the association between HPV infection and prostatitis-related symptoms.Overall, 814 out of 2,938 patients (27.7%) and 292 out of 1,081 controls (27.0%) proved positive to HPV. The HPV genotype distribution was as follows: HR-HPV 478 (43.3%), PHR-HPV 77 (6.9%), LR-HPV 187 (16.9%) and PNG-HPV 364 (32.9%). The most common HPV genotypes were: 6, 11, 16, 26, 51, 53 and 81. No difference was found between the two groups in terms of HPV infection (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.88-1.22; p = 0.66). We noted a statistically significant increase in HPV infection over the period 2005 to 2010 (p < 0.001) in both groups. Moreover, we found a statistically significant increase in HPV 16 frequency from 2005 to 2010 (p = 0.002).This study highlights that prostatitis-like symptoms are unrelated to HPV infection. Secondary, we highlight the high prevalence of asymptomatic HPV infection among young heterosexual men.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856493","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.886581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.636357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.567881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.530556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.448395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.302141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.198506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.177717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"814","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/814"},{"name":"881","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/881"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"364","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/364"},{"name":"938","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/938"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"}]}
