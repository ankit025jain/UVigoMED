{"id":40511,"title":"Pancreatitis. Secretin increases the diagnostic yield of MRCP.","abstract":"The presence of ductal abnormalities after an unexplained acute attack of acute pancreatitis or in patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis might lead to a misdiagnosis of chronic pancreatitis or complications of acute pancreatitis. A new study suggests secretin administered during magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) leads to a better diagnostic yield than MRCP alone.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25023037","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.652341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.397274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.187512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.183635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Secretin","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretin"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"}]}
