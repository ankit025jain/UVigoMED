{"id":61964,"title":"Multimodality imaging of primary CNS lymphoma in  immunocompetent patients.","abstract":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) belongs to the group of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the management of the disease is radically different from other central nervous system neoplasms. Owing to its varied appearance on imaging, diagnosis of PCNSL can be challenging. The purpose of this pictorial review is to depict the brain findings of PCNSL during initial diagnosis in immunocompetent individuals. Multimodal imaging integrating advanced sequences can facilitate differentiation of PCNSL from other CNS neoplasms.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646184","annotations":[{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma","weight":0.825454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_central_nervous_system_lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.737837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.737674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.564129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.438398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Nervous system neoplasm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system_neoplasm"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"}]}
