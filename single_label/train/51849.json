{"id":51849,"title":"Lactic acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis.","abstract":"We describe the case of a 22-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes, who was admitted to the emergency department with hypotension, unconsciousness and a severe combined diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and lactic acid acidosis. In the discussion, we focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying lactic acidosis in DKA, and we elaborate on the prognostic value of hyperlactataemia on such occasion.
