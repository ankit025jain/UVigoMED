{"id":63714,"title":"Recombinant human thrombopoietin improves platelet counts and reduces platelet transfusion possibility among patients with severe sepsis and thrombocytopenia: a prospective study.","abstract":"Thrombocytopenia is prevalent in patients with severe sepsis, and it is associated with mortalities. Effectively adjunctive treatment might be needed to reverse low platelet counts (PCs). With a growing understanding of thrombocytopenia, recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) is considered a promising beneficial drug. The present study was dedicated to evaluate the efficiency of rhTPO in improving PCs in patients with severe sepsis.We performed a prospective study in patients with severe sepsis between March 2012 and February 2013. All enrolled patients were divided into rhTPO group and control group, depending on whether rhTPO was prescribed or not. Platelet counts and other parameters were measured initially and in the following 15 days.Totally, 72 patients (38 in the rhTPO group and 34 in the control group) were included. All enrolled parameters exhibited no significant differences between groups at the baseline. Platelet counts showed a significant increase over time in both groups. Faster improvement of PCs in the rhTPO group was observed with a significant difference. Less platelet transfusion occurred in patients who received rhTPO in our study, as well. No drug-related adverse event during the rhTPO therapy was recorded.The use of rhTPO in combination with conventional medical therapies could significantly improve the PCs in patients with severe sepsis and thrombocytopenia and effectively reduce the platelet transfusion possibility.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405656","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.748238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.549851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.504888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.450836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.443488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Thrombopoietin","weight":0.424541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoietin"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.288404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Plateletpheresis","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateletpheresis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"}]}
