{"id":8567,"title":"Apoptosis-regulated low-avidity cancer-specific CD8(+) T cells can be rescued to eliminate HER2/neu-expressing tumors by costimulatory agonists in tolerized mice.","abstract":"A major barrier to vaccines in cancer treatment is their failure to activate and maintain a complete cancer-specific CD8(+) effector T-cell repertoire. Low-avidity T cells are more likely to escape clonal deletion in the thymus when compared with high-avidity T cells, and therefore comprise the major population of effector T cells available for activation in patients with cancer. However, low-avidity T cells fail to traffic into the tumor microenvironment and function in eradicating tumor under optimal vaccination conditions as opposed to high-avidity T cells that escape clonal deletion and function in tumor killing. We used high- and low-avidity T-cell receptor transgenic CD8(+) T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope HER2/neu (RNEU420-429) to identify signaling pathways responsible for the inferior activity of the low-avidity T cells. Adoptive transfer of these cells into tumor-bearing vaccinated mice identified the members of apoptosis pathways that are upregulated in low-avidity T cells. The increased expression of proapoptotic proteins by low-avidity T cells promoted their own cell death and also that of other tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells within their local environment. Importantly, we show that this proapoptotic effect can be overcome by using a strong costimulatory signal that prevents the activation-induced cell death and enables the low-avidity T cells to traffic into the tumor and assist in tumor clearance. These findings identify new therapeutic opportunities for activating the most potent anticancer T-cell responses.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764578","annotations":[{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.792059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.764139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.717209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.401113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.15486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.130308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.111569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clonal deletion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_deletion"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
