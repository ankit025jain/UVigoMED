{"id":55857,"title":"Vasodilators, blood pressure-lowering medications, and age-related macular degeneration: the Beaver Dam Eye Study.","abstract":"To examine the association of vasodilator and antihypertensive medication use with the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Longitudinal population-based study.Persons 43 to 86 years of age living in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, from 1988 through 1990.Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period. There were 9676 total person-visits over the course of the study. Status of AMD was determined from grading retinal photographs.Incidence of AMD.The 5-year incidence of early AMD over the 20-year period was 8.4%; for late AMD, it was 1.4%; for pure geographic atrophy (GA), it was 0.6%; for exudative AMD, it was 0.9%; and for progression of AMD, it was 24.9%. While adjusting for age, gender, and other factors, using a vasodilator (hazard ratio [HR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.38), particularly oral nitroglycerin (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.14-2.90), was associated with an increased risk of early AMD. Using an oral ?-blocker was associated with an increased hazard of incident exudative AMD (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.04-2.82), but not pure GA (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20-1.29) or progression of AMD (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.67-1.28) over the 20-year period.Use of vasodilators is associated with a 72% increase in the hazard of incidence of early AMD, and use of oral ?-blockers is associated with a 71% increase in the hazard of incident exudative AMD. If these findings are replicated, it may have implications for care of older adults because vasodilators and oral ?-blockers are drugs that are used commonly by older persons.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793737","annotations":[{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.796792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.489611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.447452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.391778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Nitroglycerin","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Beaver Dam, Wisconsin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Dam,_Wisconsin"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Wisconsin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin"},{"name":"Beaver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"252","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/252"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Dam","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Blocking (American football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(American_football)"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"}]}
