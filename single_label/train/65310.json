{"id":65310,"title":"The predictor analysis of response to routine treatment in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.","abstract":"This study tried to test predictors of response to routine treatment in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH).Subjects were evaluated at baseline and at week 12 following routine treatment for LUTS/BPH using the Korean version of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to measure the severity of LUTS/BPH. Demographics and various clinical variables were analyzed by regression analysis.Ninety three patients received routine treatment for LUTS/BPH for 12 weeks in a naturalistic treatment setting. None of demographics and clinical variables was different between responders and non-responders. According to multivariate regression analysis, the presence of anxiety (OR=0.203), lower improvement in the GAD-7 total score (OR=0.755) and lower improvement in the PHQ-15 total score (OR=0.811) were independent predictors of treatment response after 12 weeks routine treatment.We found the positive association of improvement in anxiety and somatization with treatment response, while presence of anxiety was negatively associated with treatment response, in patients with LUTS/BPH. However, additional studies with adequate power and improved designs are necessary to support the present findings.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878980","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.507659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.487855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.476844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.454245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Somatization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatization"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"755","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/755"},{"name":"811","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/811"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Generalized anxiety disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
