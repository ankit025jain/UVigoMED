{"id":67510,"title":"Abnormal focal 99mTc-DMSA uptake in the lung--report of two cases.","abstract":"Extrarenal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA is a rare finding, which has been described in some unusual conditions as bone metastasis, aortic aneurysm and hemangioma. The purpose of this report is to present two cases of abnormal 99mTc-DMSA uptake in the lungs, which remained unexplained even after radiologic assessment.
