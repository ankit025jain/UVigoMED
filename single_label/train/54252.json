{"id":54252,"title":"Association between fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene polymorphism and polycystic ovary syndrome: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Many studies have investigated the relationship between FTO gene polymorphism and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) susceptibility but revealed mixed results. In this study, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis to clarify this association.Published literature from PubMed, Embase and CNKI was retrieved. Meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random- or fix- effects model.A total of 5 studies (4778 cases and 4272 controls) were included in our meta-analysis. The results suggested that FTO rs9939609 polymorphism (or its proxy) was marginally associated with PCOS risk after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (OR?=?1.26; 95%CI: 1.02-1.55). However, the marginal association was not stable after sensitivity analysis. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the association was significant in East Asians (OR?=?1.43, 95%CI?=?1.30-1.59) but not in Caucasians (OR?=?1.04, 95%CI?=?0.85-1.29).Our present meta-analysis indicated that FTO rs9939609 polymorphism (or its proxy) might not be associated with risk of PCOS in overall population. However, in East Asians, there might be a direct association between FTO variant and PCOS risk, which is independent of BMI (adiposity).","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466303","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.90141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.875191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.802236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.69921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.639731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.638961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.635569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.47894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.440628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.36926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.202705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.196874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"FTO gene","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTO_gene"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Sensitivity analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"851","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/851"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Marginal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Multiracial","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"The Strip (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strip_(The_O.C.)"}]}
