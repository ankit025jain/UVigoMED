{"id":2066,"title":"Let's not forget herpes simplex virus in case of fulminant hepatic failure.","abstract":"Fulminant herpes simplex virus (HSV) hepatitis is a rare condition, which is usually identified only after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) or at autopsy. The most commonly affected individuals are immunosuppressed patients, although HSV hepatitis can occur in immunocompetent patients as well. A high degree of suspicion combined with early diagnostic modalities may improve survival. We present a case report of fulminant herpetic hepatitis, requiring OLT. In addition, a review of the literature was performed.","date":"2014-12-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509210","annotations":[{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.720296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.629535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.512566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.489896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.44844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.220775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
