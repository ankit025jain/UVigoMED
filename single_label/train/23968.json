{"id":23968,"title":"Montelukast for postinfectious cough in adults: a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"Postinfectious cough is common in primary care, but has no proven effective treatments. Cysteinyl leukotrienes are involved in the pathogenesis of postinfectious cough and whooping cough (pertussis). We investigated the effectiveness of montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, in the treatment of postinfectious cough.From April 13, 2011, to Sept 21, 2012, we randomly assigned 276 patients to montelukast (n=137) or placebo (n=139). 70 (25%) patients had laboratory-confirmed pertussis. Improvements in cough-specific quality of life occurred in both groups after 2 weeks (montelukast: mean 2·7, 95% CI 2·2-3·3; placebo: 3·6, 2·9-4·3), but the difference between groups did not meet the minimum clinically important difference of 1·3 (mean difference -0·9, -1·7 to -0·04, p=0·04). This difference was not statistically significant in any sensitivity analyses. After 2 weeks, 192 of 259 participants from whom data were available elected to continue study drug (99 [77%] of 129 participants on montelukast; 93 [72%] of 130 on placebo). After 4 weeks, there were no significant between-group differences in cough-specific quality of life improvement (montelukast: 5·2, 4·5-5·9; placebo: 5·9, 5·1-6·7; mean difference -0·5, -1·5 to 0·6, p=0·38) or adverse event rates (21 (15%) of 137 patients on montelukast reported one or more adverse events; 31 (22%) of 139 on placebo; p=0·14). The most common adverse events reported were increased mucus production (montelukast, n=6; placebo, n=2), gastrointestinal disturbance (montelukast, n=3; placebo, n=5), and headache (montelukast, n=2; placebo, n=6). One serious adverse event was reported (placebo, n=1), which was unrelated to study drug (shortness of breath and throat tightness after severe coughing bouts).Montelukast is not an effective treatment for postinfectious cough. However, the burden of postinfectious cough in primary care is high, making it an ideal setting for future antitussive treatment trials.National Institute for Health Research School for Primary Care Research, UK.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461900","annotations":[{"name":"Montelukast","weight":0.930425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montelukast"},{"name":"Leukotriene","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.753905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.725212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cough medicine","weight":0.678936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough_medicine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.634134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.597067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.444178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Leukotriene antagonist","weight":0.378195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene_antagonist"},{"name":"Pertussis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.247371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.240107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Serious adverse event","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_adverse_event"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"}]}
