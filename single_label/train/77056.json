{"id":77056,"title":"Self-efficacy, decisional balance and stages of change on dietary practices among metabolic syndrome persons, Uthai Thani Province.","abstract":"To determine factors related to stages of change regarding dietary intake of persons with metabolic syndrome in Uthai Thani.Five hundred metabolic syndrome persons were randomly selected using a three-stage sampling method and voluntarily responded to a validated, self-administered questionnaire.Majority of the respondents (36.4%) had dietary practices in the pre-contemplation stage while only 17.4 percent of them were in the action and maintenance stage. Perceived self-efficacy, pros, and cons of decisional balance for dietary intake had statistically positive association with the stages of change (Somers' d value = 0.21, 0.29, and 0.09 with p < 0.01, < 0.01, and 0.015 respectively).Perceived self-efficacy, pros, and cons of decisional balance are related to stages of change regarding dietary intake of persons with metabolic syndrome. Therefore, perceived self-efficacy, pros for positive and cons for negative dietary intake should be emphasized to elevate food consumption practices of the metabolic syndrome persons from pre-contemplation to action and maintenance stage.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851583","annotations":[{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.424648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.342722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.23498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0634039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0577463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Uthai Thani Province","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uthai_Thani_Province"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"National Football League","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Transtheoretical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transtheoretical_model"},{"name":"Uthai District","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uthai_District"}]}
