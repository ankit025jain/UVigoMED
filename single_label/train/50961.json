{"id":50961,"title":"Laparoscopic transperitoneal anterior adrenalectomy in pheochromocytoma: experience in 62 patients.","abstract":"Aim was to evaluate the results in 62 patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) for the treatment of pheochromocytoma (PHE), with a transperitoneal anterior approach for lesions on the right side, and with a transperitoneal anterior submesocolic approach in case of left-sided lesions.Sixty-two patients underwent LA for the treatment of PHE at two centers in Rome and Ancona (Italy). Two patients had bilateral lesions, for a total of 64 adrenalectomies. Sporadic PHE occurred in 57 patients (91.9 %) and in 5 (8.0 %) it was familiar. Thirty-six patients (58.0 %) underwent right adrenalectomy, 24 (38.7 %) left adrenalectomy, and in 2 cases (3.2 %) LA was bilateral. In 38 cases of right adrenalectomy (59.3 %) and in 5 cases of left adrenalectomy (7.8 %), the approach was a transperitoneal anterior one. A transperitoneal anterior submesocolic approach was used in 21 left adrenalectomy cases (32.8 %).Mean operative time for right and left transperitoneal anterior LA was 101 min (range 50-240) and 163 min (range 50-190), respectively. Mean operative time for left transperitoneal anterior submesocolic LA was 92 min (range 50-195). For bilateral adrenalectomy, mean operative time was 210 min (range 200-220). Conversion to open surgery occurred in 2 cases (3.22 %) due to extensive adhesions (1) and hemorrhage (1). One major and three minor complications were observed. Mobilization occurred on the first postoperative day. Hospitalization was 4.8 days (range 2-19). The lesions had a mean diameter of 4.5 cm (range 0.5-10).Early identification with no gland manipulation prior to closure of the adrenal vein is the main advantages of the transperitoneal anterior approach. PHE may be treated safely and effectively by a laparoscopic transperitoneal anterior approach for right-sided lesions and with a transperitoneal anterior submesocolic approach for left-sided ones.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24737532","annotations":[{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.540985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.416132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.37066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.351679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Adrenalectomy","weight":0.303079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenalectomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.293177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.203403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.0621105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Ancona","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancona"},{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/219"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"}]}
