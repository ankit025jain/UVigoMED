{"id":89574,"title":"Posttraumatic headaches in civilians, soldiers, and athletes.","abstract":"Posttraumatic headaches are one of the most common and controversial secondary headache types. After mild head injury, more than 50% of people develop a postconcussion syndrome which has been controversial for more than 150 years. Headache is estimated as present in 30% to 90% of patients after mild head injury. Most headaches are of the tension type, although migraines can increase in frequency or occur acutely or chronically de novo. A review is provided of headaches in civilians, soldiers after blast trauma, athletes, and post-craniotomy including pathogenesis. The treatments are the same as for the primary phenotypes.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703532","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.640585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.548874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.321629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Post-concussion syndrome","weight":0.155599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-concussion_syndrome"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Blast injury","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_injury"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0214189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Civilian","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"}]}
