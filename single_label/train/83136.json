{"id":83136,"title":"The TRACTISS protocol: a randomised double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of anti-B-cell therapy in patients with primary Sjögren's Syndrome.","abstract":"Primary Sjögren's Syndrome (PSS) mainly affects women (9:1 female:male ratio) and is one of the commonest autoimmune diseases with a prevalence of 0.1 - 0.6% of adult women. For patients with PSS there is currently no effective therapy that can alter the progression of the disease. The aim of the TRACTISS study is to establish whether in patients with PSS, treatment with rituximab improves clinical outcomes.TRACTISS is a UK multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, controlled, parallel group trial of 110 patients with PSS. Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive two courses of either rituximab or placebo infusion in addition to standard therapy, and will be followed up for up to 48 weeks. The primary objective is to assess the extent to which rituximab improves symptoms of fatigue and oral dryness. Secondary outcomes include ocular dryness, salivary flow rates, lacrimal flow, patient quality of life, measures of disease damage and disease activity, serological and peripheral blood biomarkers, and glandular histology and composition.The TRACTISS trial will provide direct evidence as to whether rituximab in patients with PSS leads to an improvement in patient symptoms and a reduction in disease damage and activity.UKCRN Portfolio ID: 9809 ISRCTN65360827.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438039","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.683136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.459226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.332137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.204767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.125233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0812518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.0682928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Double blind","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_blind"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
