{"id":81662,"title":"Oral lichen planus: a narrative review.","abstract":"Oral Lichen Planus (OLP) is a common disease of unknown aetiology affecting oral mucosae by T-cell mediated chronic inflammation. OLP diagnosis is made by evaluating both clinical and histological criteria. Pharmacological treatment is useful in symptomatic cases. Life-long clinical follow-up is essential, due to low-risk of malignant transformation. In vivo Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) offers a real-time virtual biopsy of the being tissues and does not require surgical excision nor histopathological processing. RCM was used to capture OLP lesions in order to clinically differentiate them from other clinical entities.
