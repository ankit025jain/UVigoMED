{"id":47976,"title":"Glycine propionyl l-carnitine attenuates d-Galactosamine induced fulminant hepatic failure in wistar rats.","abstract":"Glycine propionyl l-carnitine (GPLC) is a propionyl ester of carnitine that includes an additional glycine component. The present study evaluated hepatoprotective effect of GPLC in d-Galactosamine (d-GalN) induced fulminant hepatic failure. Rats were intraperitonially administered d-GalN (700mg/kgBW). GPLC was given as a pre-treatment (35mg/kgBW/day) for 1month followed by a single dose of d-GalN on the 31st day. d-GalN administration resulted in increased mortality and serum ALT and AST activities. These increases were significantly attenuated by GPLC. d-GalN treatment increased hepatic lipid peroxidation and a decrease in reduced glutathione content was observed. GPLC pre-treatment significantly decreased lipid peroxidation and augmented the level of GSH. d-GalN increased the circulating level of TNF-? and ATM-Kinase and MAP-Kinase expression. GPLC supplementation inhibited the increase in serum TNF-? and ATM-Kinase and MAP-Kinase expression. d-GalN treatment increased the level of Bax and Caspase-3 m-RNA while as a decline was observed in Bcl2 m-RNA. GPLC prevented the increase in Caspase-3 and Bax m-RNA and at the same time augmented the expression of Bcl2 m-RNA. Our findings suggest that GPLC alleviates d-GalN induced liver injury by strengthening antioxidative defense system and reducing apoptotic signalling pathways.
