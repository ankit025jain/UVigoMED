Somatic and neurological examination, MRI and psychometric scales for anxiety and depression were used.Women with hypertensive encephalopathy in the postmenopausal period had signs of persistent psycho-emotional disorders (higher anxiety, depression of different severity) combined with structural changes in the brain, with their severity increasing with the progression of HE.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25042496","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.748551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Neurological examination","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_examination"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.687788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.565539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.348417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.23402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.230978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Affective spectrum","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_spectrum"},{"name":"Hypertensive encephalopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertensive_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
