{"id":60390,"title":"[Blood platelets].","abstract":"Studies of inherited platelet disorders have led to major advances in our knowledge of platelet physiology, thus permitting the development of antiplatelet agents that are now widely used to treat vascular diseases. New therapeutic strategies have also resulted from a better understanding of megakaryocytopoiesis, notably including the use of thrombopoietin analogs for immune thrombocytopenias.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919364","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.663904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.323247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.152162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0783418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Thrombopoietin","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoietin"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"}]}
