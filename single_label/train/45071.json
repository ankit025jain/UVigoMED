{"id":45071,"title":"Endocannabinoid system activation contributes to glucose metabolism disorders of hepatocytes and promotes hepatitis C virus replication.","abstract":"Insulin resistance is highly prevalent in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and to some extent accounts for fibrosis and reducing viral eradication. Activated cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) signaling has been implicated in the development of phenotypes associated with insulin resistance and steatosis. We investigated the role of the endocannabinoid system in glucose metabolism disorders induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication.Human hepatic stellate cells (HSC; LX-2 cells) were co-cultured with Huh-7.5 cells or Huh-7.5 cells harboring HCV replicon (replicon cells). Endocannabinoid levels were then measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The expression of CB1R and its downstream glucose metabolism genes in hepatocytes were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot. Glucose uptake by hepatocytes and glucose production were measured. Glucose metabolism tests and measurements of HCV RNA levels and nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) levels were taken after treatment with CB1R agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethanolamide (ACEA) or antagonist AM251.Compared to the co-culture with Huh-7.5 cells, the level of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and the CB1R mRNA and protein levels increased in the co-culture of LX-2 cells with replicon cells. The activation of CB1R decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, inhibited cell surface expression of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and suppressed cellular glucose uptake; furthermore, it increased cyclic AMP response element-binding protein H (CREBH), then up-regulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) genes and down-regulated the glucokinase (GK) gene, thus promoting glucose production. Interferon treatment restored the aforementioned changes. CB1R antagonist improved glucose metabolism disorders by an increase in glucose uptake and a decrease in glucose production, and inhibited HCV replication.HCV replication may not only increase the 2-AG content, but may also up-regulate the expression of CB1R of hepatocytes, then change the expression profile of glucose metabolism-related genes, thereby causing glucose metabolism disorders of hepatocytes and promoting HCV replication. Treatment with CB1R antagonist improved glucose metabolism disorders and inhibited viral genome replication.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System
