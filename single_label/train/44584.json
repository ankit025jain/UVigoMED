{"id":44584,"title":"Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells are resistant to HBV infection during differentiation into hepatocytes in vitro.","abstract":"The therapeutic methods for chronic hepatitis B are limited. The shortage of organ donors and hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection obstruct the clinical application of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). In the present study, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were isolated from chronic hepatitis B patients and characterized for morphology, growth potency, surface phenotype and the differentiation potential. The results showed that both MSCs had adipogenic, osteogenic and neuron differentiation potential, and nearly all MSCs expressed CD105, CD44 and CD29. Compared with AD-MSCs, BM-MSCs of chronic hepatitis B patients proliferated defectively. In addition, the ability of AD-MSCs to differentiate into hepatocyte was evaluated and the susceptibility to HBV infection were assessed. AD-MSCs could differentiate into functional hepatocyte-like cells. These cells express the hepatic-specific markers and have glycogen production and albumin secretion function. AD-MSCs and hepatic differentiation AD-MSCs were not susceptible to infection by HBV in vitro. Compared with BM-MSCs, AD-MSCs may be alternative stem cells for chronic hepatitis B patients.
