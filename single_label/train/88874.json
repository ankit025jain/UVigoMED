{"id":88874,"title":"Enhancing soft-tissue reattachment in proximal humeral endoprosthetic reconstruction.","abstract":"To report on the use of the Ligament Advanced Reinforcement System (LARS) to enhance joint stability and functional outcome in proximal humeral endoprosthesis reconstruction.Two men and 5 women aged 16 to 66 (mean, 28) years underwent wide resection of tumour and endoprosthesis reconstruction of the proximal humerus using the LARS, as the rotator cuff and/or deltoid muscle could be preserved. The preserved muscles were reattached to anatomic positions to regain function. Shoulder range of motion and Musculoskeletal Tumour Society scores were evaluated.The mean follow-up was 26 (range, 14-36) months. All the 7 patients were alive without disease. The mean active abduction was 77º (range, 60°-100°), and the mean active flexion was 74° (range, 50°-100°). The mean Musculoskeletal Tumour Society score was 86% (range, 80-93%). One patient had instability of the glenohumeral joint at one year.The LARS may enhance soft-tissue reattachment and improve shoulder stability after proximal humeral endoprosthetic reconstruction.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781625","annotations":[{"name":"Deltoid muscle","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.592802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0370354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"1436","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1436"},{"name":"Head transplant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_transplant"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"Replantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replantation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"}]}
