{"id":44083,"title":"[Assessment of renal function and risk factors for renal impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis].","abstract":"To evaluate the renal function in treatment-naive patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) related cirrhosis and to identify the risk factors for renal impairment.We collected the data of 860 HBV-related cirrhosis patients hospitalized in our unit between Jan 1, 2011 and Dec 31, 2011. Liver function of the patients was assessed with Child-Pugh score system, and the renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation recommended by Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI). We investigated the prevalence of renal impairment (eGFR>60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) among these patients and explored the risk factors for renal impairment.Of the 860 patients, 296 had complete clinical data and were included in our analysis. The overall incidence of renal impairment among the enrolled patients was 8.45% (25/296). Patients with Child-Pugh stage C showed a significantly higher incidence of renal impairment than those with stages B and A (17.17% [17/99] vs 6.67%[7/105] vs 1.09% [1/92], P<0.001). Age, history of hyperuricemia, and Child-Pugh score were identified as the risk factors for renal impairment in these patients.In patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis, the incidence of renal impairment increases significantly with deterioration of the liver function, and renal function should be regularly monitored in these patients for appropriate antiviral treatment.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752090","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperuricemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperuricemia"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.659469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.134239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
