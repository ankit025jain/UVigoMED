{"id":38073,"title":"Three different situations and approaches in the management for anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus: case report.","abstract":"Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus is rare but potentially dangerous if any ischemic signs are present. Multiple therapeutic options were advocated so far. We experienced three different situations and surgical approaches to these anomalies, and reviewed retrospectively. For the first case, we made a neo-ostium on the right sinus of Valsalva and anastomosed with the right coronary artery after arteriotomy. For the second and third cases, we applied coronary artery bypasses emergently: patient 2 the gastroepiploic artery during off-pump coronary artery bypass and patient 3 the left internal thoracic artery during surgery for acute aortic dissection. For the better outcomes, it is important to understand anatomic and hemodynamic characteristics of each patient and select the surgical options considering each characteristic.
