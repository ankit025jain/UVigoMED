{"id":80989,"title":"[Mid-term evaluation on schistosomiasis control effect in Lushan earthquake-stricken areas in Sichuan Province].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of schistosomiasis control in Lushan earthquake-stricken areas in Sichuan Province, so as to provide the evidence for formulating appropriate measures for schistosomiasis prevention and control.According to the data of historical schistosomiasis prevalence, 5 villages were selected as research sites and field investigations were conducted.The average density of Oncomelania hupensis snails was 0.41 snails/0.1 m2, and there were no schistosome-infected snails. There were no acute schistosomiasis cases in these five villages. For local residents, the health education leaflets were more suitable than warning signs, and for migrant population, they were more concerned about the warning signs.After the implementation of effective prevention and control works, the epidemic risks of schistosomiasis have been controlled. However, the health education, surveillance, and prevention measures for schistosomiasis still need to be persisted in.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490354","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.678432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"History","weight":0.527397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.466738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.359322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.340833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sichuan","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan"},{"name":"Migrant worker","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Warning sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_sign"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Provinces of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"}]}
