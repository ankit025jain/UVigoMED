{"id":72769,"title":"Secondary malignancies in pediatric cancer survivors: perspectives and review of the literature.","abstract":"With continuing improvements in the successful treatment of pediatric malignancies, long term survivors of pediatric cancers and their providers are faced with new oncologic issues regarding long-term morbidities. As pediatric cancer survivors have matured into adulthood, the development of secondary malignancies has become a significant issue for these patients. Whether a consequence of treatment for the patient's original cancer, such as chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, secondary malignancies now present patients and providers with new challenges regarding treatment, surveillance and counseling. We review the major risk factors for secondary malignancies in pediatric cancer survivors, with particular emphasis on important molecular and cytogenetic risk factors, both inherited and acquired. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for surveillance and counseling of these patients.
