{"id":63222,"title":"Long-term outcome of HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic SCT without in vitro T-cell depletion for adult severe aplastic anemia after modified conditioning and supportive therapy.","abstract":"HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) is an option for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients. Here, we evaluated the outcomes of 26 adult-SAA patients who received HLA-haploidentical HSCT in five transplant centers in southwestern China. Most of the patients in this study failed prior therapy and were transfused heavily before the transplantation. The patients received fludarabine+cyclophosphamide+antithymocyte globulin as conditioning regimens and then unmanipulated peripheral blood plus marrow transplantation. Micafungin, i.v. Ig and recombinant human TPO were used for post-grafting infection prevention and supportive care. Of 26 patients, 25 achieved engraftment at a median of 13 days (range, 11-19 days) after HSCT. One of 25 patients experienced graft rejection and did not achieve sustained engraftment after second HSCT. Therefore, the final engraftment rate was 92.3%. Three of 25 (12%) patients developed acute GVHD, 10 of 25 (40%) patients developed chronic GVHD (9 with limited whereas the other with extensive). The OS rate was 84.6% and the average follow-up time was 1313.2 (738-2005) days for surviving patients. This encouraging result suggests that HLA-haploidentical HSCT is an effective therapeutic option for adults with acquired SAA if an HLA-identical donor is not available.
