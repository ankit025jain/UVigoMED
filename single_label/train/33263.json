{"id":33263,"title":"MRI-based ratio of fetal lung volume to fetal body volume as a new prognostic marker in congenital diaphragmatic hernia.","abstract":"The objective of our study was to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of the MRI-based ratio of fetal lung volume (FLV) to fetal body volume (FBV) for predicting survival and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).MRI was performed in 96 fetuses (34 females and 62 males; mean gestational age, 33 Â± 5 [SD] weeks; range, 23-39 weeks) with CDH and 44 healthy control subjects. FLV and FBV were measured for each fetus by one of three investigators, and we calculated the FLV/FBV ratio. Additionally, a subgroup analysis of growth-restricted fetuses was performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to model the dependence of survival and ECMO requirement on the FLV/FBV ratio. Prognostic accuracy was evaluated by applying the area under the curve (AUC).Seventy-eight of the 96 (81%) fetuses survived and 35 (36%) neonates needed ECMO therapy. The FLV/FBV ratio was significantly higher in fetuses who survived (p < 0.0001; AUC = 0.829). Neonates who received ECMO therapy showed a significantly lower prenatal FLV/FBV ratio (p = 0.0001; AUC = 0.811) than neonates who did not need ECMO therapy. A subgroup analysis (n = 13) showed a trend toward a higher FLV/FBV ratio of survivors in comparison with nonsurvivors (p = 0.065; AUC = 0.875).In our study, the MRI-based FLV/FBV ratio was able to predict neonatal survival and ECMO requirement in children with CDH with high accuracy. Unlike other prognostic parameters, FLV/FBV ratio is independent of a reference to a control group and may enhance prognostic accuracy particularly in growth-restricted neonatal patients.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848832","annotations":[{"name":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.755309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.724287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.604705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia","weight":0.491208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_diaphragmatic_hernia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.458664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diaphragmatic hernia","weight":0.434368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_hernia"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.303048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Lung volumes","weight":0.209202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_volumes"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.176993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
