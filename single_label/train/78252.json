{"id":78252,"title":"Synchronous electrical stimulation of laryngeal muscles: an alternative for enhancing recovery of unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis.","abstract":"Although electrical stimulation of the larynx has been widely studied for treating voice disorders, its effectiveness has not been assessed under safety and comfortable conditions. This article describes design, theoretical issues, and preliminary evaluation of an innovative system for transdermal electrical stimulation of the larynx. The proposed design includes synchronization of electrical stimuli with laryngeal neuromuscular activity.To study whether synchronous electrical stimulation of the larynx could be helpful for improving voice quality in patients with dysphonia due to unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (URLNP).A 3-year prospective study was carried out at the Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion in the Mexico City. Ten patients were subjected to transdermal current electrical stimulation synchronized with the fundamental frequency of the vibration of the vocal folds during phonation. The stimulation was triggered during the phase of maximum glottal occlusion. A complete acoustic voice analysis was performed before and after the period of electrical stimulation.Acoustic analysis revealed significant improvements in all parameters after the stimulation period.Transdermal synchronous electrical stimulation of vocal folds seems to be a safe and reliable procedure for enhancing voice quality in patients with (URLNP).","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726329","annotations":[{"name":"Phonation","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"List of voice disorders","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_voice_disorders"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Fundamental frequency","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.664018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.646552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Vibration","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.39193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Voice analysis","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_analysis"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Glottal consonant","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_consonant"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mexico City","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"Music theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Laryngeal nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Transdermal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
