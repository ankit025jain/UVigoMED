{"id":34047,"title":"Cortical interneuron loss and symptom heterogeneity in Huntington disease.","abstract":"The cellular basis of variable symptoms in Huntington disease (HD) is unclear. One important possibility is that degeneration of the interneurons in the cerebral cortex, which play a critical role in modulating cortical output to the basal ganglia, might play a significant role in the development of variable symptomatology in HD. This study aimed to examine whether symptom variability in HD is specifically associated with variable degeneration of cortical interneurons.We undertook a double-blind study using stereological cell counting methods to quantify the 3 major types of ?-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons (calbindin-D28k, calretinin, parvalbumin) in 13 HD cases of variable motor/mood symptomatology and 15 matched control cases in the primary motor and anterior cingulate cortices.In the primary motor cortex, there was a significant loss (57% reduction) of only calbindin interneurons (p=0.022) in HD cases dominated by motor symptoms, but no significant interneuron loss in cases with a dominant mood phenotype. In contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex showed a major significant loss in all 3 interneuron populations, with 71% loss of calbindin (p=0.001), 60% loss of calretinin (p=0.001), and 80% loss of parvalbumin interneurons (p=0.005) in HD cases with major mood disorder, and no interneuron loss was observed in cases with major motor dysfunction.These findings suggest that region-specific degeneration of cortical interneurons is a key component in understanding the neural basis of symptom heterogeneity in HD.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771513","annotations":[{"name":"Basal ganglia","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia"},{"name":"Interneuron","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneuron"},{"name":"Mood disorder","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder"},{"name":"Huntington's disease","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington's_disease"},{"name":"Primary motor cortex","weight":0.878797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_motor_cortex"},{"name":"Anterior cingulate cortex","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Motor cortex","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex"},{"name":"Cingulate cortex","weight":0.757791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cingulate_cortex"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.612257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Tardive dyskinesia","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.52844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Parvalbumin","weight":0.519192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvalbumin"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.492371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.415115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.333918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Calbindin","weight":0.309541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calbindin"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.270229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Calretinin","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calretinin"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"}]}
