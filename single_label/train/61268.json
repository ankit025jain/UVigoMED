{"id":61268,"title":"[The multiple myeloma--current view and perspectives].","abstract":"The multiple myeloma (MM) is still an incurable malignant plasma cell disease. Therapy is necessary, once symptoms of end organ damage occur. Numerous \",new substances\" (proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory substances) were introduced in the past decade, resulting in improved treatment results. Polychemotherapy, alternating drug applications and the principle of \"continuous therapy\" are used to achieve a high response rate (with the aim of a long-lasting disease control). Among all patients those with extramedullary disease (EMD) are currently the most difficult treatable patients. It remains to be seen whether and when genomic analyses by next generation sequencing will yield to an understanding of the ups and downs of various tumor subclones. Maybe such technologies result in the development of real targeted therapies for myeloma in the future. To date, such therapies are not available.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741848","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.82223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.76081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.692802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.563085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.552922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.542751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.291663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.270076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.221849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Down (gridiron football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(gridiron_football)"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Electro-Motive Diesel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro-Motive_Diesel"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"}]}
