{"id":62733,"title":"[Loss of appetite, night sweats, eczema, and axillary and inguinal lymph node swelling in a 28-year-old man].","abstract":"A 28-year-old man presented with loss of appetite, night sweats, eczema, and axillary and inguinal lymph node swelling. The tentative diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was made. To confirm the diagnosis, extirpation of a lymph node and a skin biopsy were performed. Systemic treatment with methylprednisolone resulted in an improvement of eczema and lymph node swelling. Because of the histological findings and clinical course, we diagnosed dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, also known as Pautrier-Woringer syndrome.
