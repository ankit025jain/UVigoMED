{"id":5066,"title":"Survey of early complications of primary skin graft and secondary skin graft (delayed) surgery after resection of burn waste in hospitalized burn patients.","abstract":"Burning is the second most common cause of home injuries in Iran that is often the cause of conflicts between children and young adults. Burning can lead to early and late complications that scar and contracture are the most common. Burn waste treatment is done by two methods: excision and then skin graft after the formation of granulation tissue; and excision and graft simultaneously that in this study, these two methods are compared.This was performed as a quasi-experimental analysis and retrospective study on all patients who were hospitalized for burn scar. All patients who have associated with weak eningimmune diseases such as diabetes, acquired immunodeficiency or congenital, taking steroids and patients undergoing chemotherapy etc. are excluded. The method of grafting in patients is primary graft procedure that was compared with patients who are treated using secondary graft. Data collected through review of patients' hospital and clinic chart.The mean burn percentage in the primary repair group was 14.4% and in the delayed repair group was 16.6%, respectively. The incidence of hematoma in both groups was zero. Skin necrosis and graft rejection and infection in the primary repair group was in 3.7% of patients and in the delayed repair group was in 1.2% of cases (P=0.5) CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, no difference was observed between the two methods of excision and primary graft with delayed graft in the incidence of graft rejection. Due to the shorter treatment of primary graft and patient satisfaction and also according to the findings of this study excision and primary graft method seems appropriate method for treating old waste burning.Â ","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363185","annotations":[{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.812907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.672562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.630434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.626514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.397804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
