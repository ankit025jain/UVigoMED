{"id":34578,"title":"[Diagnosis and evaluation of a patient with cor triatriatum using perioperative transesophageal echocardiography].","abstract":"Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly accounting for only 0.1-0.4% of all congenital heart diseases usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood and rarely found in adults. It is characterized by fibromuscular membrane dividing the left atrium into two chambers. This congenital heart disease is reported to be frequently associated with variety of cardiac anomalies such as an atrial septal defect, anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, and persistent left superior vena cava. A woman with no cardiac history was admitted to the hospital due to acute heart failure and diagnosed as severe mitral regurgitation and cor triatriatum by pre-orerative transthoracic echocardiography. Emergency mitral valve plasty was undertaken because of the severity of mitral regurgitation without determining the detailed type of cor triatriatum. Thus, diagnosis of the type of cor triatriatum with perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was required to establish correct cardiopulmonary bypass and determine the operative procedure. Perioperative TEE revealed that the type was Lucas-Schmidt- I A, and cardiopulmonary bypass was established safely. Operation was performed without any problems. The TEE skill of our anesthesiologists could contribute to the safe management of the cardiac surgery.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724446","annotations":[{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Left atrium","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_atrium"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.782745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.782643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.767827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.76732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Pulmonary vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_vein"},{"name":"Cor triatriatum","weight":0.743667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cor_triatriatum"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.667327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.666355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.616713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.575603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Heart chamber","weight":0.504837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_chamber"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.405469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.389465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.305641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.148263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
