{"id":62280,"title":"[Application of high resolution HLA typing in unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation].","abstract":"This study was purposed to investigate the clinical value of HLA matching(low and high resolution) and its effect on outcome of the patients received umbilical cord blood transplantation(UCBT). Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (SSOP) , sequence-based typing (SBT) and sequence-specific primers(SSP) were used to perform high resolution HLA matching for HLA-A, -B, -Cw, -DRB1, -DQB1 and low resolution for HLA-A, B, DRB1 among 34 patients with hematologic malignancies who received unrelated UCB transplantation and grafts. The effects of HLA matching (low or high resolution ) on leading engraftment, hematopoietic reconstitution, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infection after UCB transplantation were analyzed by comparison. The results showed that the median of total nucleated cells (TNC) of transplanted cord blood was 6.0×10(7)/kg, The time of neutrophil recovery was significantly shortened when more than 5×10(7)/kg TNC were transplanted (P < 0.05). The HLA-(6-10)/10 group of high resolution HLA matching was better than the HLA (4-5)/10 group in the respect of leading engraftment, the time of platelet recovery and the rate of acute GVHD (P < 0.05). In contrast, HLA-I+II locus, HLA-DRB1 or HLA-DQB1 locus mismatch could prolong the platelet engraftment time (P < 0.05). There was statistical difference in the time of platelet recovery, the rate of acute GVHD between the HLA (5-6)/6 group of low resolution HLA matching and the HLA (3-4)/6 group after UCB transplantation (P < 0.05), but the mismatch locus of HLA with low resolution did not correlate with the time of platelet recovery (P > 0.05). It is concluded that the high resolution HLA matching between patients received unrelated UCB transplantation and grafts may contribute to select the better UCB, that has important clinical value to promote hematopoietic reconstitution and to reduce the complications after UCB transplantation.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598664","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.771688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.654425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.638494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.629802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.486358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"HLA-DQB1","weight":0.297271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DQB1"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"HLA-DRB1","weight":0.0924838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DRB1"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Shrink Small-Outline Package","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrink_Small-Outline_Package"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"},{"name":"Typewriter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter"},{"name":"346","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/346"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Douay-Rheims Bible","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douay-Rheims_Bible"},{"name":"Multinational corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Carlow GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlow_GAA"}]}
