{"id":45351,"title":"Influence of hepatitis viruses on clinicopathological profiles and long-term outcome in patients undergoing surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"The global risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. In recent years, however, an increased prevalence of non-viral HCC has been noted. The clinical impact of the presence/absence of viral infections in HCC remains controversial. The present study aimed to assess the effect of hepatitis viruses on demographics, clinical and pathological features and long-term outcome in a large cohort of Romanian patients who underwent surgery for HCC.The study included 404 patients with HCC who had undergone resection, transplantation or radiofrequency ablation at a single institution between 2001 and 2010. The patients were divided into four groups: 85 patients with hepatitis B virus infection (HBV group), 164 patients with hepatitis C virus infection (HCV group), 39 patients with hepatitis B and C virus co-infection (HBCV group), and 116 patients without viral infection (non-BC group).The patients of both HBV (56.0+/-11.3 years) and HBCV groups (56.0+/-9.9 years) were significantly younger than those of the HCV (61.0+/-8.5 years, P=0.001) and non-BC groups (61.0+/-13.0 years, P=0.002). Interestingly, the prevalence of liver cirrhosis was significantly lower in the non-BC group (47%) than in any other subsets (72%-90%, P<0.002). Furthermore, the non-BC patients were more advanced according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stages than the patients of the HCV or HBCV groups (P<0.020); accordingly, they were more frequently assessed beyond the Milan criteria than any other groups (P=0.001). No significant differences in the disease-free or overall survival rates were observed among these groups.Patients with non-viral HCC are diagnosed at advanced ages and stages, a situation plausibly due to the poor effectiveness of cancer surveillance in community practice. The presence of viral infections does not appear to impair the long-term prognosis after surgical treatment in patients with HCC; however, there is a trend for worse disease-free survival rates in HBCV patients, though statistical significance was not reached.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686543","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.755917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.742391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.700817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.578288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.447386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.356061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Barcelona","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona"},{"name":"Milan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Stem cell controversy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_controversy"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
