{"id":41701,"title":"VX-222, a non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor, in telaprevir-based regimens for genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection.","abstract":"To investigate in this phase 2a study (ZENITH) the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of VX-222, a selective, non-nucleoside inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase, combined with various telaprevir-based regimens for treatment of genotype 1 HCV.In total, 152 treatment-naive patients received VX-222+telaprevir ('DUAL' regimen; n=47), with ribavirin ('TRIPLE' regimen; n=46), or with peginterferon+ribavirin ('QUAD' regimen; n=59) for 12 weeks. Patients with detectable HCV RNA at weeks 2 and/or 8 received peginterferon+ribavirin for 24 (DUAL and TRIPLE) or 12 (QUAD) additional weeks.VX-222 (100 or 400 mg twice daily) was well tolerated, with an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events observed with the higher dose. Across VX-222 400-mg twice-daily regimens, the QUAD was associated with the highest frequency of grade 3/4 adverse events. The DUAL was discontinued because of high viral breakthrough before week 12. Sustained virologic response (SVR) 24 weeks after end of treatment (SVR24), including patients treated with 12 or 24 additional weeks of peginterferon+ribavirin, was 67% for TRIPLE (VX-222 400 mg twice daily) and 79 and 90% for QUAD (VX-222 100 and 400 mg twice daily, respectively).These results provide valuable information regarding the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of telaprevir combined with a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, as dual therapy or with ribavirin without or with peginterferon. Telaprevir and VX-222, alone or with ribavirin without or with peginterferon, were generally well tolerated, with improved tolerability without peginterferon. SVR24 rates achieved with TRIPLE and QUAD regimens containing telaprevir and VX-222 were comparable to those observed with telaprevir-based therapy.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901821","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.593279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.203825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
