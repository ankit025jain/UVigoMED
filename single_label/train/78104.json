{"id":78104,"title":"[The current tendencies and prospects of the neural response telemetry in the rehabilitation of the patients after cochlear implantation].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to estimate the potential of the modern technique for telemetry of the neural response during rehabilitation of the patients following cochlear implantation. The methods for the purpose included comparison of the results of intra- and postoperative registration on neural response telemetry (NRT) and evaluation of the influence of perimodiolar localization of electrodes of cochlear implants on the threshold level of stimulation and propagation of excitation inside the cochlea. The results of the study confirm the possibility of using the registration of the electrically evoked auditory nerve potential for fitting the speech processor of the cochlear implant. In addition, it was shown that the application of the perimodiolar electrode significantly narrows the intracochlear excitation distribution profile which enhances the rehabilitative effectiveness of cochlear implantation.
