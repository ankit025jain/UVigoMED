{"id":62506,"title":"Bone marrow mast cell density correlates with serum levels of VEGF and CXC chemokines ENA-78 and GRO-? in multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Angiogenesis is a crucial process in growth and progression of multiple myeloma (MM). Mast cells (MCs) play an important role in MM angiogenesis. Various angiogenic mediators secreted by MCs regulate endothelial cell proliferation and function. Among them, ELR(+) CXC chemokines, such as growth-related oncogen-alpha (GRO-?) and epithelial neutrophil activating protein-78 (ENA-78), have been described as potential mediators in regulation of angiogenesis. The purpose of the study was to quantify MCs in bone marrow (BM) biopsies of MM patients, expressed as MC density (MCD), and correlate it with serum concentrations of vascular endothelial factor (VEGF), GRO-?, ENA-78. Fifty-four newly diagnosed MM patients and 22 healthy controls were studied. Tryptase was used for the immunohistochemical stain of MCs. VEGF, GRO-?, and ENA-78 were measured in sera by ELISA. MCD and serum levels of GRO-?, ENA-78, and VEGF were significantly higher in MM patients compared to controls (p<0.001 in all cases). MCD was significantly increasing with increased stage of the disease (p<0.001). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between MCD with VEGF, GRO-?, and ENA-78. These findings support that MCs participate in the pathophysiology of MM and is implicated in the angiogenic process and disease progression.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563338","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.617919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.545523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.250053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Tryptase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptase"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
