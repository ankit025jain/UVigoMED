{"id":86472,"title":"[Characteristics of complete genome of pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus isolated in Fujian Province, China].","abstract":"This study aims to investigate the characteristics of genomic variation of pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus isolated in Fujian Province, China. Complete genome sequence analysis was performed on 14 strains of pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus isolated from Fujian during 2009-2012. All virus strains were typical low-pathogenic influenza viruses, with resistance to amantadine and sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors. Eight genome fragments of all strains were closely related to those of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain, with > or = 98.2% homology. Compared with the vaccine strain, the influenza strains from Fujian had relatively large variation, and variation was identified at 11 amino acid sites of the HA gene of A/Fujiangulou/SWL1155/2012 strain, including 4 sites (H138R, L161I, S185T, and S203T) involved inthree antigen determinants (Ca, Sa, and Sb). In conclusion, the influenza vaccine has a satisfactory protective effect on Fujian population, but the influenza strains from Fujian in 2012 has antigenic drift compared with the vaccine strain, more attention should therefore be paid to the surveillance of mutations of pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract
