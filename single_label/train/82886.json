{"id":82886,"title":"Fiber-post bond strength in canals obturated with a cross-linked gutta-percha core obturator.","abstract":"The aim of this in-vitro study was to evaluate the bond strength of fiber posts cemented in a root canal filled using various root-canal obturation techniques. A total of 33 monoradicular samples, treated endodontically, were randomly assigned to three groups according to the root-canal obturation technique: group 1, continuous-wave technique; group 2, plastic-obturator-core technique; and group 3, cross-linked gutta-percha obturator-core technique. Fiber posts were luted in each sample and each was sectioned perpendicular to the post axis. The push-out test was performed using a universal machine and the maximum failure load was recorded in MPaÂ mm(-2) . Several samples were randomly chosen for scanning electron microscopy evaluation. The mean debris and dentinal tubule-opening scores were calculated separately in the coronal and apical portions. Bond strength was significantly higher in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. Debris scores were significantly higher in the apical portion of groups 2 and 3 than in group 1. Within the limitations of this study it can be affirmed that thermoplasticized alpha gutta-percha seemed to worsen the cleaning of post-space walls and hence reduced fiber-post bond strength.
