{"id":48650,"title":"[Endocrine changes with aging: physiological rather than pathological].","abstract":"Changes in endocrine functional status, including androgen deficiency in men, decreased GH and DHEA secretion (leading to loss of muscle and bone mass), thyroid dysfunction (especially hypothyroidism) are all much more common in older individuals. In this brief review we will focus on the knowledge of the mechanisms of each of these endocrine disorders progressing with age and analyse the effects of various hormonal replacement therapies on clinical outcomes in the elderly population. We will successively discuss the pituitary-thyroid axis (especially the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism), the hypothalamo-pituitary axis (deficiency in GH-IGF1), the pituitary-adrenocortical function (reduction in DHEA and DHEAS) and the pituitary-gonadal axis in men (late onset hypogonadism).","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065241","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.864248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Endocrine disease","weight":0.779953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dehydroepiandrosterone","weight":0.746993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.576605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.499628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.394121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.273852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone_sulfate"}]}
