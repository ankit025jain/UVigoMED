{"id":32892,"title":"Is early delivery beneficial in gastroschisis?","abstract":"Gastroschisis neonates have delayed time to full enteral feeds (ENT), possibly due to bowel exposure to amniotic fluid. We investigated whether delivery at <37weeks improves neonatal outcomes of gastroschisis and impact of intra/extra-abdominal bowel dilatation (IABD/EABD).A retrospective review of gastroschisis (1992-2012) linked fetal/neonatal data at 2 tertiary referral centers was performed. Primary outcomes were ENT and length of hospital stay (LOS). Data (median [range]) were analyzed using parametric/non-parametric tests, positive/negative predictive values, and regression analysis.Two hundred forty-six patients were included. Thirty-two were complex (atresia/necrosis/perforation/stenosis). ENT (p<0.0001) and LOS (p<0.0001) were reduced with increasing gestational age. IABD persisted to last scan in 92 patients, 68 (74%) simple (intact/uncompromised bowel), 24 (26%) complex. IABD or EABD diameter in complex patients was not significantly greater than simple gastroschisis. Combined IABD/EABD was present in 22 patients (14 simple, 8 complex). When present at <30weeks, the positive predictive value for complex gastroschisis was 75%. Two patients with necrosis and one atresia had IABD and collapsed extra-abdominal bowel from <30weeks.Early delivery is associated with prolonged ENT/LOS, suggesting elective delivery at <37weeks is not beneficial. Combined IABD/EABD or IABD/collapsed extra-abdominal bowel is suggestive of complex gastroschisis.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888837","annotations":[{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.241559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Gastroschisis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroschisis"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"}]}
