{"id":52475,"title":"The effectiveness of structured personal care of type 2 diabetes on recurrent outcomes: a 19 year follow-up of the study Diabetes Care in General Practice (DCGP).","abstract":"The estimation of effect size in clinical trials commonly disregards recurrent outcomes. We investigated the effectiveness of a complex intervention on recurrent outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.As previously shown, the intervention reduced the rates of first occurrence of both MI and any diabetes-related endpoint. However, for all outcomes, the HR for a second event showed a statistically non-significant tendency to be increased. We estimated a combined HR for all marginal failure times, regardless of whether they were first, second or later events. This showed that the intervention had no effect on the rate of any of the outcomes, including MI (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76, 1.05) and any diabetes-related endpoint (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87, 1.09).In the DCGP study, a smaller proportion of patients who received structured care experienced a first occurrence of MI or any diabetes-related endpoint compared with patients who received routine care. However, the patients who received structured care tended to experience more recurrent outcomes, so the total outcome rate was not affected by the intervention.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599111","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.767691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.394998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.342819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Diabetes Care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_Care"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"},{"name":"Conditional probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
