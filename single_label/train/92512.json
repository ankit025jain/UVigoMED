{"id":92512,"title":"[Arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of stiff elbow].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical results of arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of stiff elbow.From October 2010 to December 2012, 27 patients with stiff elbow were treated with arthroscopic debridement and joint capsular releasing. There were 18 males and 9 females, ranging in age from 24 to 54 years old, with an average of 35.7 years old. Analgesia and rehabilitation were necessary after operation. Mayo criteria system was used to evaluate therapeutic effects.All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 12 to 18 months, with a mean of 13.5 months. The mean maximum flexion angle of patients improved from preoperative (61.5 ± 30.1) degrees to postoperative (102.5 ± 20.1) degrees; and the mean maximum extension angle improved from preoperative (34.8 ± 12.1) degrees to postoperative (16.3 ± 16.1) degrees; the average total range of motion improved from preoperative (34.2 ± 21.0) degrees to postoperative (84.9 ± 9.2) degrees. According to the Mayo criteria system, the average score increased from preoperative 60.5 ± 13.4 to postoperative 88.7 ± 6.3; ten patients got an excellent result, 13 good and 4 fair.Arthroscopic surgery to treat elbow stiffness has such advantages as minimal invasion, less blood loss, fast recovery, and clear visualization, which is effective to improve elbow joint functions with less complications.","date":"2015-01-12","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577919","annotations":[{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.90179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.406715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Slow-start","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-start"},{"name":"Curse of 1940","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_1940"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mental image","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"}]}
