{"id":79723,"title":"Sellar cysticercosis and septum pellucidum cyst: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Sellar cysticercosis is a rare form of neurocysticercosis. A septum pellucidum cysts is a rare, often asymptomatic cystic structure between the lateral ventricles. We report here a male patient with sellar cysticercosis and septum pellucidum cysts who was successfully treated by neuroendoscopic resection. The patient was a 28-year-old male who presented with intermittent headaches for 5 years. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a well-circumscribed 13 mm cystic space-occupying lesion in the sellar region and the cavum septum pellucidum. The cyst in the saddle area was completely resected via endoscopic endonasal-transsphenoidal approach. Postoperative histological examination verified cysticerci in the cyst wall. To our knowledge, this is the first case of sellar cysticercosis and a septum pellucidum cyst successfully treated through neuroendoscopic resection.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974642","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.728732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.717004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.619792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.573664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.556597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.514089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Lateral ventricles","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_ventricles"},{"name":"Cysticercoid","weight":0.220727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercoid"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.145853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Cysticercosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercosis"},{"name":"Neurocysticercosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocysticercosis"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
