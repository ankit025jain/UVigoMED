{"id":84076,"title":"Outcomes of fenestrated/branched endografting in post-dissection thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.","abstract":"Fenestrated/branched thoracic endovascular repair (F/Br-TEVAR) is increasingly applied for atherosclerotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA); however, use in post-dissection TAAAs is still very limited. Experience with F/Br-TEVAR in the treatment of post-dissection TAAA is presented.Data were analysed from prospectively maintained databases including all patients with post-dissection TAAAs that underwent F/Br-TEVAR within the period January 2010 to July 2013 in two vascular institutions. Evaluated outcomes included initial technical success, operative mortality and morbidity, late survival, endoleak, aneurysm diameter regression, renal function, and reintervention during follow-up (FU).A total of 31 patients (25 male, mean age 65 ± 11.4 years) were treated. Technical success was 93.5% and 30-day mortality 9.6%. Temporary spinal cord ischaemia occurred in four (12.6%) patients, with no case of permanent paraplegia. Mean FU was 17.0 ± 10 months. There were seven late deaths, all aneurysm unrelated. Estimated overall survival rates were 83.9 ± 6.7, 76.4 ± 7.9 and 71.6 ± 8.7% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. Impairment of renal function occurred in two (6.4%) patients. Endoleaks were diagnosed in 12 patients during FU, including six type IB endoleaks and six type II endoleaks. Reintervention was required in seven (22.5%) patients. Mean aneurysm sac regression was 9.3 ± 8.7 mm, with a false lumen thrombosis rate of 66.7% and 88.2% for patients with a FU longer than 6 and 12 months respectively.F/Br-EVAR is feasible for patients with a post-dissection TAAA. Although associated with additional technical challenges, and a significant need for reintervention, it leads to favourable aneurysm morphologic changes, and may play a more prominent role in the future for this type of pathology if long-term results confirm the good initial outcome.","date":"2014-12-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176618","annotations":[{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.773804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.714885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.352692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.295809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.152005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Professional wrestling throws","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
