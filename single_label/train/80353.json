{"id":80353,"title":"Identification and characterization of an asparaginyl endopeptidase from Angiostrongylus cantonensis.","abstract":"Asparaginyl endopeptidase, also known as legumain, is a family of cysteine proteases in many organisms. In this study, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (Ac-AEP) was identified from the cDNA library of Angiostrongylus cantonensis. The full-length of Ac-AEP was determined to be 1,472 bp with an open reading frame of 1,341 bp encoding a putative protein with 446 amino acids. This putative protein was determined to have 37-65% identity in the amino acid sequences of the asparaginyl endopeptidases of other parasitic helminths. By real-time quantitative PCR analysis, Ac-AEP was revealed to be more abundantly expressed in the female adult worms than in other development stages. A recombinant asparaginyl endopeptidase (rAc-AEP) was then produced by a Pichia pastoris expression system. Posttranslational modification was shown to occur via N-linked glycosylation in this recombinant enzyme. The proteolytic activity of rAc-AEP was inhibited by iodoacetamide but not affected by E64, pepatain A, AEBSF, and EDTA. Moreover, the purified rAc-AEP was recognized by IgG in serum samples from BALB/c or ICR mice with A. cantonensis infection and patients with eosinophilic meningitis. These findings indicate that the rAc-AEP may have the potential for detecting A. cantonensis infection.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Parasitic
