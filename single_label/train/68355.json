{"id":68355,"title":"Polytetrafluoroethylene expanded prosthesis as replacement of the inferior vena cava in renal cell carcinoma with caval thrombus.","abstract":"To assess the outcomes of inferior vena cava replacement with polytetrafluoroethylene expanded prosthesis in patients with renal cell carcinoma and caval thrombosis.All patients who underwent radical nephrectomy with inferior vena cava replacement by polytetrafluoroethylene expanded prosthesis for renal cancer associated with inferior vena cava thrombosis and a suspicion of inferior vena cava wall invasion from January 2000 to June 2011 were considered for this study. Demographic data, postoperative course, graft patency and survival data were evaluated.A total of 26 patients (median age 59.5 years, range 19.9-85.6 years) were included in the analysis. The median tumor diameter was 10?cm (range 5-14?cm). Histological invasion of the wall of the inferior vena cava was found in 16 (61.5%) cases. The median follow up was 28 months (range 1-136). A graft thrombosis occurred in five (19.2%) patients within the first year. Four of these patients died before the end of the second year. Patency of the inferior vena cava graft at 6 and 12 months was 88% and 79%, respectively. Overall survival probability at 3 years was 64%.Prosthetic replacement of the inferior vena cava can be carried out when invasion of the wall of the inferior vena cava is suspected. The postoperative complication rate in this subset of high-risk patients undergoing radical nephrectomy seems acceptable, and the patency of the prostheses is good in most of the cases.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528332","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.74505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.730041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.676801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.592414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.43953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.43589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.288198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.237461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.227383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1136","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1136"},{"name":"985","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/985"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"2003 invasion of Iraq","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Kaval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaval"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
