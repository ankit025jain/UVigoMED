{"id":81285,"title":"Minimal intervention dentistry and older patients part 2: minimally invasive operative interventions.","abstract":"As described in the first paper of this two part series, the expansion of our older population and the concomitant reduction in levels of edentulism will result in an increase in the number of patients presenting in general practice with complex restorative challenges. The application of the concepts of minimal intervention dentistry and minimally invasive operative techniques may offer a powerful armamentarium to the general dentist to provide ethical and conservative treatment to older patients.When it is unavoidable, operative intervention should be as minimally invasive as practicable in older patients to preserve the longevity of their natural dentition.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195481","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.306619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.211848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.132832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.119397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Longevity","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"}]}
