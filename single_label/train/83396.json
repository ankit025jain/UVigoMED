{"id":83396,"title":"[Cross-sectional association between sedentary behaviors and overweight/obesity among children and adolescents in Chengdu, Sichuan].","abstract":"To explore the situation of sedentary behavior and how it correlated to overweight/obesity among children and adolescents in Chengdu, China.A total of 2 211 children and adolescents aged 7-15 years old were recruited in Chengdu city by using the cluster random sampling method. This was a cross-sectional study which aimed to collect data on anthropometry including height and weight and information on basic characters and sedentary behavior by using a self-designed questionnaire.According to IOTF criteria, the reporting rate of factor as 'watching TV ? 2 hours per day on weekend' showed statistically significant differences among normal, overweight and obese groups (34.80% , 4.21% and 1.92% respectively, P = 0.016 0) in boys. The reporting rates of 'doing homework ? 2 hours per day' were 12.17% , 0.89% and 0.49% respectively (P = 0.036 0) and statistically different among the three groups, in girls. Similar results were obtained in boys based on the WGOC criteria. However, there was no statistical difference seen on sedentary behaviors among the three groups in girls according to WGOC criteria. After stratified by age groups, rates on 'watching TV on weekend' were statistically different among normal, overweight and obese group in 13-15 age group in girls (P = 0.035 1). Physical activity level (PAL)was positively associated with WHR among both boys and girls when grouped according to PAL (Schofield). However, it was positively associated with WHR only seen in boys according to Chinese Nutrition Society (CNS) criteria.The reporting rates of sedentary behavior in obese children were higher than that in overweight/normal ones. However, the correlation of sedentary behaviors on overweight/obesity called for further studies.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25376676","annotations":[{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"China","weight":0.639124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.601523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.591856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.587523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.371943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.32551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.240275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.085352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Homework","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homework"},{"name":"PAL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL"},{"name":"Sichuan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan"},{"name":"Chengdu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
