{"id":15810,"title":"Awareness, perception and coverage of tetanus immunisation in women of child bearing age in an urban district of Lagos, Nigeria.","abstract":"This study assessed the level of awareness and perception of women of child bearing age to tetanus immunisation and determines the cover- age rate in Ojodu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State, Nigeria.This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of 288 women of child bearing age selected using multistage sampling technique. Information was obtained using structured close-ended questionnaire. Data analysis was done using Epi-InfoTM software, version 3.5.1.There was high level of awareness of tetanus immunisation among respondents (89%) and as a method of prevention of tetanus (76%). There was a positive association between the level of awareness and respondents' educational level and occupation (p < 0.05). However, there is a low level of awareness regarding the number of doses of the vaccine required in pregnancy(14.4%) and for life protection (19.5%). Those who ever received the vaccine,got it post-injury (48.9%) and in pregnancy (45.2%). Age, occupation and parity were positively associated with receiving the vaccine (p < 0.05), while parity and marital status were positively associated with number of dose of vaccine received (p < 0.05). Only about 20% of the respondents had received two or more doses of the vaccine.This study concludes that despite the high level of awareness about tetanus and tetanus immunisation, there is a low coverage rate of tetanus immunisation among women of child bearing age in Ojodu LCDA of Lagos State. Women of child bearing age should also be targeted at the community level in tetanus immunisation campaign programme.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25126863","annotations":[{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.741884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.607489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.583341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.434841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Multistage sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_sampling"},{"name":"Lagos State","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State"},{"name":"Urban district","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_district"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Tetanus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus"},{"name":"Lagos","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Local government","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Multistage rocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Political campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign"},{"name":"Editions of Dungeons & Dragons","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_&_Dragons"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Marital status","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_status"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
