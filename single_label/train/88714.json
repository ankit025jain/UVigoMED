{"id":88714,"title":"HIP-55/DBNL-dependent regulation of adrenergic receptor mediates the ERK1/2 proliferative pathway.","abstract":"The activation of ?-adrenergic receptors (?-ARs) plays a key role in regulating cardiac function. However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms of ?-AR-induced fibrosis are still unclear. We used a proteomics approach to analyze the changes in protein expression patterns in cardiac fibrosis with ?-AR stimulation. HIP-55 (also called debrin-like; DBNL) was revealed as a novel regulator in the signaling regulatory network with ?-AR activation. Further studies of both HIP-55-overexpressed and -deficient cardiac fibroblasts indicated that HIP-55 negatively regulated ?-AR-activated cardiac fibroblast proliferation and the proliferative signaling pathway may be associated with the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation. Our data provide a new mechanistic insight into the role of HIP-55 in ?-AR-induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation and suggest a new treatment strategy for proliferative disorders.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802081","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.802668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.789102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.503836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.389086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Systems biology","weight":0.322866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.23054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
