{"id":83976,"title":"GPR30 mediates anorectic estrogen-induced STAT3 signaling in the hypothalamus.","abstract":"Estrogen plays an important role in the control of energy balance in the hypothalamus. Leptin-independent STAT3 activation (i.e., tyrosine(705)-phosphorylation of STAT3, pSTAT3) in the hypothalamus is hypothesized as the primary mechanism of the estrogen-induced anorexic response. However, the type of estrogen receptor that mediates this regulation is unknown. We investigated the role of the G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) in estradiol (E2)-induced STAT3 activation in the hypothalamus.Regulation of STAT3 activation by E2, G-1, a specific agonist of GPR30 and G-15, a specific antagonist of GPR30 was analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Effect of GPR30 activation on eating behavior was analyzed in vivo.E2 stimulated pSTAT3 in cells expressing GPR30, but not expressing estrogen receptor ER? and ER?. G-1 induced pSTAT3, and G-15 inhibited E2-induced pSTAT3 in primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons. A cerebroventricular injection of G-1 increased pSTAT3 in the arcuate nucleus of mice, which was associated with a decrease in food intake and body weight gain.These results suggest that GPR30 is the estrogen receptor that mediates the anorectic effect of estrogen through the STAT3 pathway in the hypothalamus.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25200186","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Arcuate nucleus","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcuate_nucleus"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Anorectic","weight":0.838374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectic"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Anorexia nervosa","weight":0.741285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.70764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.334811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.328957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.244121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.229301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.155226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.0524275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"GPR30","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPR30"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
