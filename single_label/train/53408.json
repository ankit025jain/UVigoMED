{"id":53408,"title":"Strong claudin 5 expression is a poor prognostic sign in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","abstract":"We investigated the expression of claudin 5 in 88 ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. The results were correlated with patient prognosis, with claudin 5 expression in blood vessels, with the expression level of bcl2 and bax and with apoptosis. Claudin 5 expression was detected in 24 (38%) cases. It was not associated with tumour size or spread, but strong claudin 5 expression correlated with a worse survival (p = 0.005). Claudin 5 also associated with a higher extent of apoptosis and greater expression of bax protein. In the tumour vasculature, some vessels displayed a loss of claudin 5 expression. The presence of this loss was associated with tumour grade and the presence of nodal metastases (p = 0.02, p = 0.022, respectively). These results indicate that claudin 5 is upregulated in a proportion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. The association of strong claudin 5 expression with a worse survival is in line with some earlier reports indicating that this protein is involved with increased locomotion and more aggressive spread of carcinomas. The association of claudin 5 with apoptosis and bax might be due to stronger cellular kinetics found in such tumours. The loss of claudin 5 expression in the tumour vasculature points to a leaky vessel type; this might also ease the access of tumours to vessels and be reflected in its association with the presence of nodal metastases.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519061","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.756197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.623674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Claudin","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudin"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.307663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Animal locomotion","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_locomotion"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0173036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"}]}
