{"id":45420,"title":"[Effects of acupuncture stimulation of different acupoint groups on sleeping duration and serum and striatal dopamine contents in rats with gastric mucosal injury].","abstract":"To observe the effect of acupuncture intervention on gastric ulcer (GU) and sleeping quality from the viewpoint of brain-gut axis which plays an important role in the regulation of many vital functions in health and disease.Forty male Wistar rats were randomized into normal control, GU model, acupuncture of \"Zhongwan\" (CV 12)-\"Zusanli\" (ST 36, gastric treatment acupoints), acupuncture of \"Shenmai\" (BL 62)-\"Zhaohai\" (KI 6, sleep-promotion acupoints), and acupuncture of CV 12-ST 36-BL 62-KI 6 (combined treatment) groups, with 8 rats in each group. GU model was established by intragastric perfusion of dehydrated alcohol (1 mL/rat), and sleep model established by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg) after the last treatment. The abovementioned acupoints were punctured with filiform needles and stimulated by manipulating the needle for about 30 s, once every 5 mm during 20 mm of needle retention. The treatment was conducted once daily for five days. Gastric mucosal lesion index was assessed by Guth's method, and the mucosal pathological changes were observed under microscope after H. E. staining. The contents of dopamine (DA) in the serum and striatal tissues were detected by ELISA kit.Compared with the normal control group, the rats' sleeping duration, and serum DA content were markedly decreased and the gastric mucosal lesion index, and the striatal DA content remarkably increased in the model group (P < 0.01). In comparison with the model group, the rats' sleeping duration, and serum DA content were significantly increased, and the gastric mucosal lesion index, and the striatal DA content remarkably down-regulated in the CV 12-ST 36 (gastric treatment acupoints), BL 62-KI 6 (sleep-promotion acupoints) and CV 12-ST 36-BL 62-KI 6 (combined treatment) groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The effects of the combined treatment group were notably superior to those of the sleep promotion acupoints group in reducing mucosal lesion index and in increasing serum DA level (P < 0.01, P < 0.05).Acupuncture stimulation of \"Zhongwan\" (CV 12), \"Zusanli\" (ST 36), \"Zhaohai\" (KI 6) and \"Shenmai\" (BL 62) can relieve the gastric mucosal lesion, and prolong the sleeping duration in gastric lesion rats, which may be related to its effects in increasing blood DA and lowering striatal DA level, suggesting a correlation between the gastrointestinal disorders and sleeping.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System
