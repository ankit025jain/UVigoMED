{"id":19753,"title":"[Best practice use of corticosteroids in rheumatoid arthritis].","abstract":"Since the 50s oral glucocorticoids including prednisone are used in the management of rheumatoid arthritis due to their efficacy and the limited availability of the other treatments in the past. Thereafter numerous studies confirmed the usefulness of prednisone in controlling clinical inflammatory manifestations and the progression of radiographic damage. Sixty years later the position of prednisone in the treatment strategy of rheumatoid arthritis is still controversial, considering the presence of numerous side effects and the availability of other effective treatments. If prednisone can be reasonably used in some situations either as bridging therapy in combination with other treatments or in case of flare, its long-term use should be avoided.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701713","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.729928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.643556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.62001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.222042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Flare (pyrotechnic)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare_(pyrotechnic)"}]}
