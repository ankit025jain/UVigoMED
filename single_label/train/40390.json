{"id":40390,"title":"Anti-lipoapoptotic effect of Artemisia capillaris extract on free fatty acids-induced HepG2 cells.","abstract":"Artemisia capillaris (AC) has been recognized as one of the promising candidates for hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antiobesitic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic effectiveness. This study evaluated the inherent mechanism and anti-apoptotic activity of 30% ethanol extract of AC (AC extract) 100 ?g/ml on free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced HepG2 cellular steatosis and lipoapoptosis.Hepatic steatosis was induced by culturing HepG2 cells with a FFAs mixture (oleic and palmitic acid at the proportion of 2:1) for 24 h, thus ultimately giving rise to lipoapoptosis. Cell viability and lipid accumulation were detected by MTT assay and Oil Red O staining method respectively and Caspase-3, -9, Bax, Bcl-2, p-JNK and PUMA were measured for lipoapoptosis after 24 hours.AC extract significantly improved the FFAs-induced steatosis without cytotoxicity and Caspase-3, -9, Bax and Bcl-2 were modulated profitably to HepG2 cells after AC treatment. In addition, AC extract inhibited the activation of c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) and PUMA, which mechanism is related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Combined together, AC extract exerted an obvious hypolipidemic and anti-apoptotic effect, indicating that AC extract might have potential therapeutic herb against NASH.","date":"2014-07-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038800","annotations":[{"name":"Palmitic acid","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.872918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.735901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.62153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.58092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.538047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.452287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Steatohepatitis","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatohepatitis"},{"name":"Oleic acid","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleic_acid"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.352428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.221688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Hypolipidemic agent","weight":0.177943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypolipidemic_agent"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"Oil Red O","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_Red_O"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Ammonium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"}]}
