{"id":71521,"title":"GPER mediated estradiol reduces miR-148a to promote HLA-G expression in breast cancer.","abstract":"Breast cancer is the most common malignant diseases in women. miR-148a plays an important role in regulation of cancer cell proliferation and cancer invasion and down-regulation of miR-148a has been reported in both estrogen receptor (ER) positive and triple-negative (TN) breast cancer. However, the regulation mechanism of miR-148a is unclear. The role of estrogen signaling, a signaling pathway is important in development and progression of breast cancer. Therefore, we speculated that E2 may regulate miR-148a through G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER). To test our hypothesis, we checked the effects of E2 on miR-148a expression in ER positive breast cancer cell MCF-7 and TN cancer cell MDA-MB-231. Then we used GPER inhibitor G15 to investigate whether GPER is involved in regulation of E2 on miR-148a. Furthermore, we analyzed whether E2 affects the expression of HLA-G, which is a miR-148a target gene through GPER. The results showed that E2 induces the level of miR-148a in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, GPER mediates the E2-induced increase in miR-148a expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and E2-GPER regulates the expression of HLA-G by miR-148a. In conclusion, our findings offer important new insights into the ability of estrogenic GPER signaling to trigger HLA-G expression through inhibiting miR-148a that supports immune evasion in breast cancer.
