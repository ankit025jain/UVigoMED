{"id":68515,"title":"A combination trial of vaccine plus ipilimumab in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: immune correlates.","abstract":"We recently reported the clinical results of a Phase I trial combining ipilimumab with a vaccine containing transgenes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and for a triad of costimulatory molecules (PROSTVAC) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Thirty patients were treated with escalating ipilimumab and a fixed dose of vaccine. Of 24 chemotherapy-na√Øve patients, 58 % had a PSA decline. Combination therapy did not exacerbate the immune-related adverse events associated with ipilimumab. Here, we present updated survival data and an evaluation of 36 immune cell subsets pre- and post-therapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected before therapy, at 13 days and at 70 days post-initiation of therapy, and phenotyped by flow cytometry for the subsets of T cells, regulatory T cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Associations between overall survival (OS) and immune cell subsets prior to treatment, and the change in a given immune cell subset 70 days post-initiation of therapy, were evaluated. The median OS was 2.63 years (1.77-3.45). There were trends toward associations for longer OS and certain immune cell subsets before immunotherapy: lower PD-1(+)Tim-3(NEG)CD4EM (P = 0.005, adjusted P = 0.010), higher PD-1(NEG)Tim-3(+)CD8 (P = 0.002, adjusted P = 0.004), and a higher number of CTLA-4(NEG) Tregs (P = 0.005, adjusted P = 0.010). We also found that an increase in Tim-3(+) natural killer cells post- versus pre-vaccination associated with longer OS (P = 0.0074, adjusted P = 0.015). These results should be considered as hypothesis generating and should be further evaluated in larger immunotherapy trials.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24514956","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.782206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.728404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.604105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.405451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.392794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.356577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.288079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Electromagnetic radiation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"},{"name":"Ipilimumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipilimumab"},{"name":"CTLA-4","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTLA-4"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Transgene","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgene"}]}
