{"id":40720,"title":"Postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding in orthognathic surgery patients: its estimated prevalence and possible association to known risk factors.","abstract":"To assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients after orthognathic surgery and its relation to known risk factors.With institutional review board approval, a single-center case series was conducted with data collected retrospectively from orthognathic surgical patients' medical records from 1990 to 2010. All patients were treated by 1 primary surgeon, were limited to 21 years or younger at the time of surgery, and had no coagulopathy. The authors' hypothesis was that patients concurrently exposed to mechanical ventilation and dual anti-inflammatory drugs in the postoperative period would be at a greater risk for clinically significant GI bleeding according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guideline compared with those exposed to fewer risk factors. Its prevalence and relation to known risk factors were analyzed.In total 498 orthognathic cases consisting of 220 male patients (median age, 17 yr; age range, 3Â to 21 yr) and 262 female patients (median age, 17 yr; age range, 10 to 21 yr) were reviewed. Of 17 patients admitted to intensive care unit level of care postoperatively, 4 patients were exposed to concomitant administration of ketorolac and steroids while being mechanically ventilated. Two of these 4 patients developed esophagogastroduodenoscopy-confirmed upper GI bleeding (UGIB). There was no incidence of UGIB in patients not exposed to all 3 risk factors concurrently.Postoperative GI bleeding complication is rare in orthognathic surgical patients, with an estimated prevalence of 0.4%. Based on these observations, orthognathic surgical patients who require mechanical ventilation and are receiving anti-inflammatory medications may have an increased risk of GI bleeding. In the absence of active bleeding from the surgical site, persistent decrease in hemoglobin concentration should alert one to consider the possibility of UGIB.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997023","annotations":[{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.774202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.752874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.692693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.663387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.529215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.148052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Ketorolac","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
