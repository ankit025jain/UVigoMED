{"id":85398,"title":"miR-210 promotes IPF fibroblast proliferation in response to hypoxia.","abstract":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the relentless spread of fibroblasts from scarred alveoli into adjacent alveolar units, resulting in progressive hypoxia and death by asphyxiation. Although hypoxia is a prominent clinical feature of IPF, the role of hypoxia as a driver of the progressive fibrotic nature of the disease has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia robustly stimulates the proliferation of IPF fibroblasts. We found that miR-210 expression markedly increases in IPF fibroblasts in response to hypoxia and that knockdown of miR-210 decreases hypoxia-induced IPF fibroblast proliferation. Silencing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2? inhibits the hypoxia-mediated increase in miR-210 expression and blocks IPF fibroblast proliferation, indicating that HIF-2? is upstream of miR-210. We demonstrate that the miR-210 downstream target MNT is repressed in hypoxic IPF fibroblasts and that knockdown of miR-210 increases MNT expression. Overexpression of MNT inhibits hypoxia-induced IPF fibroblast proliferation. Together, these data indicate that hypoxia potently stimulates miR-210 expression via HIF-2?, and high miR-210 expression drives fibroblast proliferation by repressing the c-myc inhibitor, MNT. In situ analysis of IPF lung tissue demonstrates miR-210 expression in a similar distribution with HIF-2? and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase-IX in cells within the IPF fibrotic reticulum. Our results raise the possibility that a pathological feed-forward loop exists in the IPF lung, in which hypoxia promotes IPF fibroblast proliferation via stimulation of miR-210 expression, which in turn worsens hypoxia.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951777","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.802167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.601573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.521852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.392283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.364702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.301538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.2313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.14988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
