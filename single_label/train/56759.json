{"id":56759,"title":"Efficacy of the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in neuromyelitis optica: a pilot study.","abstract":"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO).Seven patients with anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab)-positive NMO or NMO spectrum disorders were recruited on the basis of their limited responsiveness to their current treatment. They were given a monthly injection of TCZ (8 mg/kg) with their current therapy for a year. We evaluated the annualized relapse rate, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and numerical rating scales for neurogenic pain and fatigue. Serum levels of anti-AQP4-Ab were measured with AQP4-transfected cells.Six females and one male with NMO were enrolled. After a year of TCZ treatment, the annualized relapse rate decreased from 2.9 ± 1.1 to 0.4 ± 0.8 (p < 0.005). The Expanded Disability Status Scale score, neuropathic pain, and general fatigue also declined significantly. The ameliorating effects on intractable pain exceeded expectations.Interleukin-6 receptor blockade is a promising therapeutic option for NMO.This study provides Class IV evidence that in patients with NMO, TCZ reduces relapse rate, neuropathic pain, and fatigue.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634453","annotations":[{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.783879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Neuropathic pain","weight":0.779278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.534454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Expanded Disability Status Scale","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_Disability_Status_Scale"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.386405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aquaporin 4","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin_4"},{"name":"Neuromyelitis optica","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromyelitis_optica"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.280046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Tocilizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocilizumab"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Whitewater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewater"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Responsiveness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsiveness"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"}]}
