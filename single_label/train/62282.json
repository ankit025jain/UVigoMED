{"id":62282,"title":"[High resolution melting analysis for detecting of JAK2V617F mutation in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms].","abstract":"This study was purposed to investigate the feasibility of high resolution melting (HRM) in the detection of JAK2V617F mutation in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). The 29 marrow samples randomly selected from patients with clinically diagnosed MPN from January 2008 to January 2011 were detected by HRM method. The results of HRM analysis were compared with that detected by allele specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) and DNA direct sequencing. The results showed that the JAK2V617F mutations were detected in 11 (37.9%, 11/29) cases by HRM, and its comparability with the direct sequencing result was 100%. While the consistency of AS-PCR with the direct sequencing was moderate (Kappa = 0.179, P = 0.316). It is concluded that the HRM analysis may be an optimal method for clinical screening of JAK2V617F mutation due to its simplicity and promptness with a high specificity.
