{"id":88591,"title":"Effect of odanacatib on BMD and fractures: estimates from Bayesian univariate and bivariate meta-analyses.","abstract":"Odanacatib (ODN), a selective cathepsin-K inhibitor, was found to increase bone mineral density (BMD); the effect on fractures is based on adverse event reports.To estimate current effects and predict future effects of ODN on BMD and fractures.Electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), conference proceedings, and bibliographies.Trials that compared ODN 50 mg/wk to placebo for at least 1 year and reported changes in BMD or fractures. Meta-analysis: Two bone outcomes were pooled as independent and as joint outcomes in Bayesian univariate and bivariate random-effects models.Of 32 potentially eligible articles, six citations describing four trials (993 patients) were included. ODN for 3 years increased mean BMD at the lumbar spine by 5.0% (95% credible interval [CrI], 2.7, 7.5), total hip by 3.6% (95% CrI, 1.6, 5.9), and femoral neck (FN) by 3.6% (95% CrI, 1.6, 5.7). In a future trial of 3-year duration, the predicted mean increase in BMD, adjusted for the effect on fractures, was 4.9% for lumbar spine (95% CrI, 2.5, 7.4), 3.4% for total hip (95% CrI, 1.7, 5.2), and 3.5% for FN (95% CrI, 1.8, 5.3). After accounting for the effect on FN BMD, ODN for 3 years was associated with a population odds ratio of 0.38 (95% CrI, 0.1, 0.8). In a future trial, the odds ratio was 0.41 (95% CrI, 0.1, 1.1). The probability of benefit on fractures was 96-99%. The estimates remained robust in sensitivity analyses.Our analyses suggest that ODN will increase BMD and decrease all fractures in the fracture outcome trial; however, direct demonstration of this antifracture efficacy is needed.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Wounds and
