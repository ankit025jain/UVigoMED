{"id":90282,"title":"Inhibition of amyloid precursor protein secretases reduces recovery after spinal cord injury.","abstract":"Amyloid-? (A?) is produced through the enzymatic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by ? (Bace1) and ?-secretases. The accumulation and aggregation of A? as amyloid plaques is the hallmark pathology of Alzheimer?s disease and has been found in other neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and multiple sclerosis. Although the role of A? after injury is not well understood, several studies have reported a negative correlation between A? formation and functional outcome. In this study we show that levels of APP, the enzymes cleaving APP (Bace1 and ?-secretase), and A? are significantly increased from 1 to 3 days after impact spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. To determine the role of A? after SCI, we reduced or inhibited A? in vivo through pharmacological (using DAPT) or genetic (Bace1 knockout mice) approaches. We found that these interventions significantly impaired functional recovery as evaluated by white matter sparing and behavioral testing. These data are consistent with a beneficial role for A? after SCI.
