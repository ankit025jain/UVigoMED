{"id":37507,"title":"[Electrocardiogram in the cardiovascular rare diseases].","abstract":"Electrocardiography is a method which can not be replaced by any other examination in arrhythmias. It also plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of arrhythmic rare diseases by providing not only diagnostic data, but also paving the way for treatment. This article presents some characteristic examples of ECG in arrhythmic rare diseases (i.e., polimorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, Coumela syndrome, nonreentrant supraventricular tachycardia with double ventricular response).","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490460","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Ventricular tachycardia","weight":0.783059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.620985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Supraventricular tachycardia","weight":0.54303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Brugada syndrome","weight":0.276208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Road surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_surface"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
