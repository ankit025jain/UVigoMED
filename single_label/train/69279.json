{"id":69279,"title":"Association between urinary symptoms and quality of life in HTLV-1 infected subjects without myelopathy.","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between urinary symptoms and quality of life of patients infected with HTLV-1.This is a cross-sectional study that enrolled individuals with HTLV-1 positive serology from February 2010 to March 2011. Participants were HTLV-1 infected subjects followed in the HTLV-1 clinic of the University Hospital in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Patients with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), who had evidence of other neurological diseases, diabetes mellitus or were pregnant were excluded from the study. The questionnaire SF-36 was used to evaluate quality of life and the questionnaire OAB-V8 was used to evaluate urinary symptoms.From the 118 individuals evaluated, 50 (42.4%) complained of urinary symptoms and 68 (57.6%) did not. Most participants were females. There was no difference between the groups regarding demographic variables. The group with symptoms showed significantly lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 questionnaire. The domains with greatest differences were vitality and general health state.Urinary symptoms negatively influence the quality of life of individuals infected with HTLV-1.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456778","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.851375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.800917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.773266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.633922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.564444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.48828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Salvador, Bahia","weight":0.4393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.383031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.37894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.198926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Human T-lymphotropic virus","weight":0.134992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_T-lymphotropic_virus"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Tropical spastic paraparesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_spastic_paraparesis"},{"name":"Bahia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia"},{"name":"Myelopathy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelopathy"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"London Buses route 118","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Buses_route_118"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
