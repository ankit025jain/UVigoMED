{"id":79514,"title":"The effect of a health communication campaign on compliance with mass drug administration for schistosomiasis control in western Kenya--the SCORE project.","abstract":"Compliance with mass drug administration (MDA) can be affected by rumors and mistrust about the drug. Communication campaigns are an effective way to influence attitudes and health behaviors in diverse public health contexts, but there is very little documentation about experiences using health communications in schistosomiasis control programs. A qualitative study was conducted with community health workers (CHWs) as informants to explore the effect of a health communication campaign on their experiences during subsequent praziquantel MDA for schistosomiasis. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated into English where applicable, and analyzed thematically using ATLAS.ti software. According to the CHWs, exposure to mass media messages improved awareness of the MDA, which in turn, led to better treatment compliance. Our findings suggest that communication campaigns influence health behaviors and create awareness of schistosomiasis control interventions, which may ultimately improve praziquantel MDA.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246690","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.627232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.325833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.315169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.234308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.118291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Praziquantel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praziquantel"},{"name":"Mass drug administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_drug_administration"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Political campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign"},{"name":"Regulatory compliance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Cordyline fruticosa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyline_fruticosa"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health in Ethiopia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_in_Ethiopia"},{"name":"Health communication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_communication"},{"name":"ATLAS experiment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATLAS_experiment"},{"name":"SCORE International","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCORE_International"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mistrust","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistrust"}]}
