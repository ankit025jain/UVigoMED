{"id":17731,"title":"Fusaric acid modulates Type Three Secretion System of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.","abstract":"Natural small-molecule products are promising lead compounds for developing a generation of novel antimicrobials agents to meet the challenge of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. To facilitate the search for novel anti-virulence agents, we chose a virulence factor of Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) as a drug target to screen candidates from a small-molecule library in our laboratory. This study demonstrated fusaric acid had dramatically inhibitory effects on secretion of Salmonella island 1 (SPI-1) effector proteins and invasion of Salmonella into HeLa cells. Moreover, fusaric acid had no inhibitory effects on bacterial growth and viability of host cells. Protein HilA is a key regulator of SPI-1 in Salmonella, which affects transcription of SPI-1 effectors and SPI-1 apparatus genes. In this study, fusaric acid (FA) did not affect secretion of SPI-1 effectors in HilA over-expressed strain, suggesting it did not affect the transcription of SPI-1. In addition, fusaric acid did not affect the protein level of apparatus protein PrgH in SPI-1 needle complex. As a result, we proposed fusaric acid had an inhibitory effect on SPI-1 probably depending on its influence on SicA/InvF. In summary, fusaric acid is a novel inhibitor of T3SS with potential for further developing novel anti-virulence agents.
