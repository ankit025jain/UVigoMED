{"id":92329,"title":"Slipped capital femoral epiphysis: how to evaluate with a review and update of treatment.","abstract":"Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) involves displacement of the proximal femoral metaphysis relative to a fixed epiphysis, usually during a period of rapid growth and unique physeal susceptibility. Patients have characteristic clinical, histologic, and radiologic features. Several clinical signs and medical diagnoses should prompt radiologic and laboratory workup. Limp or hip or knee pain in a patient 10 to 16 years old should include SCFE in the differential. If confirmed, appropriate treatment involves proximal femoral physeal stabilization and/or realignment. The optimal surgical treatment of severe SCFE and its late sequela remain an evolving and controversial subject.
