{"id":51630,"title":"Effects of warfarin and L-carnitine on hemostatic function and oxidative stress in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex progressive disease characterized by hyperglycemia and a high risk of atherothrombotic disorders affecting the coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial trees. Oxidative stress is reported in diabetic patients. We investigated the hemostatic functions and oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the effects of warfarin and L-carnitine on those parameters. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: control, DM, and DM received warfarin or L-carnitine. In all rats, blood glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fibrinogen, factor VII (FVII), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), fibrin degradation products (FDP), protein C, antithrombin III (ATIII), malondialdehydes (MDA), and antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione) were measured. Also, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), coagulation time, and platelet aggregation were evaluated. In diabetic rats, plasma glucose, HbA1c, MDA, fibrinogen, FVII, FDP, PAI-1, and platelet aggregation increased while insulin, PT, aPTT, coagulation time, protein C, ATIII, and antioxidants decreased. Warfarin administration to diabetic rats decreased FVII and FDP and increased PT, aPTT, and coagulation time with no effect on MDA, antioxidants, PAI-1, protein C, ATIII, and platelet aggregation. On the other hand, L-carnitine decreased fibrinogen, FVII, FDP, PAI-1, MDA, and platelet aggregation and increased PT, aPTT, coagulation time, protein C, ATIII, and antioxidants in diabetic rats. Therefore, we concluded that hyperglycemia plays an important role in hypercoagulation state and oxidative stress in STZ-induced DM. While L-carnitine improves oxidative stress and decreases the hypercoagulation state in DM, warfarin normalizes the hypercoagulation state with no effect on oxidative stress.
