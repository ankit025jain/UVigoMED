{"id":74668,"title":"Muscle damage and adaptation after the second bout of eccentric exercise of the knee extensors.","abstract":"This study examined the muscles ability to adapt to eccentric exercise by the changes in serum myoglobin (Mb), creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness. The study involved 54 healthy young men from the 23Â± 2yr age group. These were distributed as subjects for three types of experiments with 18 men in each. Subjects performed 300 maximal eccentric exercises. In experiment I, after performing the first bout of exercise, they were split into three subgroups to perform the second bout after a period of 4, 6, and 8 weeks (WK), respectively. In experiment II, performed the second exercise after a period of 2, 3, and 5 wk, respectively. In experiment III, they performed four exercise bouts spaced 1 wk apart. in experiment II a significant (P<0.05) decrease in muscle soreness, serum Mb and CK was found on exercise bout 2. In experiment III, serum CK, Mb and muscle soreness responses were highest following bout 1. It was concluded that performance of a single exercise bout had a prophylactic effect on muscle soreness and serum protein responses that lasts approximately 2 wk, with the greatest adaptation occurring after one bout.
