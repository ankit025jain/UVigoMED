{"id":43649,"title":"Potential celiac children: 9-year follow-up on a gluten-containing diet.","abstract":"Potential celiac disease (CD) is defined by the presence of serum anti-tissue-transglutaminase (anti-TG2) antibodies and normal duodenal mucosa. The major clinical problem is the management of asymptomatic patients and how to predict the development of villous atrophy. This prospective longitudinal cohort study describes the natural history of potential CD up to 9 years and explores risk factors associated with the development of mucosal damage.Two hundred and ten potential CD children were eligible for the study; 175/210 asymptomatic children were left on a gluten-containing diet. Antibodies and clinical symptoms were checked every 6 months, and a small bowel biopsy was taken every 2 years to evaluate histological, immunohistochemical, and anti-TG2 deposits. Patients were genotyped for HLA and a set of non-HLA CD-associated genes.Forty-three percent of patients showed persistently elevated anti-TG2 level, 20% became negative during follow-up, and 37% showed a fluctuant anti-TG2 course with transiently negative values. At 3 years of follow-up, 86% of cases remained potential; 73 and 67% still had normal duodenal architecture at 6 and 9 years, respectively. Male sex, slight mucosal inflammation at time 0, and a peculiar genetic profile delineate a cohort of individuals who were prone to develop mucosal damage during time.A sizeable proportion of asymptomatic potential celiac patients showed fluctuation or negativization of antibody production, and many of these, with persistently positive anti-TG2, did not develop mucosal damage after 9 years of follow-up. Celiac population is a multivariate aggregate of individuals with different genetic and phenotypic profiles. Caution is required before prescribing a gluten-free diet for life to asymptomatic individuals with potential CD.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777149","annotations":[{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Intestinal villus","weight":0.734816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_villus"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.684946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.327164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.312451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
