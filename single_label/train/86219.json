{"id":86219,"title":"Hepatitis B virus preS1-derived lipopeptide functionalized liposomes for targeting of hepatic cells.","abstract":"To enhance the liver-specific delivery, HBVpreS/2-48(myr) (HBVP), a synthetic HBVpreS-derived lipopeptide endowed with compelling liver tropism, was conjugated to PEGylated liposomes (HBVP-Lip) for hepatic cell-specific delivery. Compared with the non-targeted liposomes, a significantly higher amount of HBVP-Lip were taken up by the primary mice hepatocytes through a receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism. The endocytosis inhibition assay demonstrated that the endocytosis of HBVP-Lip was mediated mainly by caveolin and clathrin. After systemic administration in mice, HBVP-Lip could be specifically internalized into hepatocytes efficaciously. Furthermore, the hepatoprotective effects of HBVP-Lip loaded with silybin (SLB) on carbon tetrachloride induced acute liver damage were remarkably stronger than the SLB solution and SLB loaded non-targeted liposomes. Preliminary safety results suggested that no acute systemic toxicity or immunotoxicity was observed after intravenous administration with HBVP-Lip. These results indicated that the HBVP-Lip could deliver the payloads to the hepatocytes with high specificity in vitro and in vivo, and raise new possibilities for liver-specific drug delivery systems, gene delivery systems, and bio-imaging systems.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797877","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon tetrachloride","weight":0.938724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.865347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.792723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.730257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.663387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.531511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Silibinin","weight":0.517882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.507719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.382723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Clathrin","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.277186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.272232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Caveolae","weight":0.214415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveolae"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.1965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Immunotoxin","weight":0.110219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotoxin"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Tropism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropism"},{"name":"Lipopeptide","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopeptide"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"}]}
