{"id":80059,"title":"[Report on 16 cases of small intestine ascariasis diagnosed by capsule endoscopy].","abstract":"The clinical data and capsule endoscopy image of 16 adult patients with small intestine ascariasis were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively from June 2006 to June 2012 in West China Hospital. Among the 16 patients, 15 cases manifested as gastrointestinal bleeding, 15 cases showed anemia (3 severe, 10 moderate, and 2 mild), 2 had hypoalbuminemia, 1 had peripheral blood eosinophilia. All the cases were found to be fecal occult blood positive, but no Ascaris eggs found in the feces. Capsule endoscopy showed they were infected with Ascaris worms. The worms were found in the proximal small intestine in 14 patients and 2 in the distal intestine. Mucosal erythema and erosions around the worm were observed in 3 cases, and 7 cases were found with active bleeding or old haemorrhage in small intestine.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812868","annotations":[{"name":"Ascariasis","weight":0.908778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascariasis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Hypoalbuminemia","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoalbuminemia"},{"name":"Fecal occult blood","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_occult_blood"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.753081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Capsule endoscopy","weight":0.74515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_endoscopy"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.744465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.574033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.501685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.421462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.371901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.364669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
