{"id":91343,"title":"Dorsalis Pedis Adipofascial Perforator flap for great toe reconstruction: anatomical study and clinical applications.","abstract":"Defects of the dorsum of the foot can be challenging to reconstruct, none more so than the dorsum of the toe. The reverse Dorsalis Pedis Adipofascial Perforator (DPAP) flap is one possible reconstructive option for defects in this region. The aim of this study was to first demonstrate the anatomy of this flap, particularly the consistency of the perforators arising from the dorsalis pedis artery. Second, we present a clinical series based on this flap to demonstrate how it can be used. For the anatomical studies, 22 fresh cadaveric lower extremities were dissected, and injection studies were used to delineate the vascular territories. The presence of the distal perforator, distance to the first metatarso-phalangeal joint and diameter of each perforator were recorded. The cadaveric studies confirmed the presence of distal perforators to the first metatarso-phalangeal joint in 100% of limbs examined. The clinical study demonstrated the feasibility of the use of the adipofascial turn-over perforator flap for dorsal foot reconstruction. These anatomic findings provide an alternative method of reconstruction of great toe defects using the reverse DPAP flap.
