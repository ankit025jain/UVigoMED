{"id":43690,"title":"Protein losing enteropathy in systemic lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic immunologic disorder that may affect multiple organ systems and present with myriad of clinical features. Gastro-intestinal (GI) manifestations are oral ulcers, dysphagia and abdominal pain caused by autoimmune peritonitis/intestinal vasculitis. Hypoalbuminaemia due to GI loss is uncommon. Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) is a group of clinical entities where there is loss of protein through GI tract. PLE due to SLE is rare but it can be the initial manifestation. Patients usually present with pedal oedema mimicking nephrotic syndrome clinically. It is diagnosed by excluding other causes of hypoalbuminaemia. Radio nucleotide labelled albumin scan is useful in confirming albumin loss through GI tract. Often there is a good response to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. Here we present two SLE patients whose presenting manifestation was protein losing enteropathy and both improved with corticosteroids.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772735","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Hypoalbuminemia","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoalbuminemia"},{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.811497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.711964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.622531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.578454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.242061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Protein losing enteropathy","weight":0.0998947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_losing_enteropathy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0911197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"}]}
