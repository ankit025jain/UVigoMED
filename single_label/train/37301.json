{"id":37301,"title":"Diagnosis of abdominal wall defects in the first trimester.","abstract":"To review prognostic parameters reported recently in the evaluation of abdominal wall defects in the first trimester.Evaluation of abdominal wall defects in the first trimester is based principally on associated structural or chromosomal anomalies. In the case of gastroschisis, which is rarely associated with other anomalies, evaluation of prenatal or postnatal outcome is based mainly on the course of pregnancy. In the case of isolated omphalocele in the first trimester, recent studies have evaluated parameters that could help predict prenatal or postnatal outcome.We review recent studies using new parameters to diagnose abdominal wall defects in the first trimester and to provide early prenatal counselling to parents regarding prenatal and postnatal prognosis.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504173","annotations":[{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Omphalocele","weight":0.542051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalocele"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.527546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.211358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Gastroschisis","weight":0.197756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroschisis"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.160012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
