{"id":92074,"title":"Assessment of strength, flexibility, and running mechanics in men with iliotibial band syndrome.","abstract":"Cross-sectional laboratory study.To assess differences in hip strength, iliotibial band length, and hip and knee mechanics during running between male runners with iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) and healthy controls.Flexibility, strength, and running mechanics are commonly assessed in patients with ITBS. However, these variables have not been evaluated concurrently in this population.Thirty-four men participated (17 healthy, 17 ITBS). Hip strength was measured with a handheld dynamometer, and iliotibial band length was assessed using an inclinometer while performing the Ober test. Kinetic and 3-D kinematic data were obtained during running. Kinematic variables of interest included frontal and transverse plane hip and knee joint angles during early stance. Independent-samples t tests, as well as effect sizes, were used to assess group differences.Compared to the control group, persons with ITBS had a significantly lower Ober measurement (1.2°), weaker hip external rotators (1.2 Nm/kg), greater hip internal rotation (3.7°), and greater knee adduction (3.6°). However, only hip internal rotation and knee adduction exceeded the minimal detectable difference value.Our results suggest that intervention strategies that target neuromuscular control of the hip and knee may be indicated for males with ITBS.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450366","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.542599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.228134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Iliotibial tract","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_tract"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Iliotibial band syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band_syndrome"},{"name":"Inclinometer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclinometer"},{"name":"Dynamometer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamometer"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Handheld game console","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Running","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Frontal bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_bone"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Flexibility (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility_(anatomy)"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Stage lighting accessories","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_lighting_accessories"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Iowa Tests of Basic Skills","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Tests_of_Basic_Skills"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Internal rotation","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rotation"}]}
