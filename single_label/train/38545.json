{"id":38545,"title":"Influence of medical treatment, smoking and disease activity on pregnancy outcomes in Crohn's disease.","abstract":"OBJECTIVE. Little is known about predictors for adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with Crohn's disease (CD). In this population-based study, we examined pregnancy outcomes in CD stratified by medical treatment and smoking status while accounting for disease activity. METHODS. In two Danish regions with a population of 1.6 million, we identified 154 CD women who had given birth within a 6-year period. We combined questionnaire data, prescription data, data from medical records and population-based medical databases. We used logistic regression to estimate prevalence odds ratios (POR) for adverse pregnancy outcomes by different predictors. RESULTS. Among 105 (80%) respondents, 55 (52%) reported taking medication during pregnancy. The majority (95%) were in disease remission. The children's mean birth weight did not differ by maternal medical treatment. As expected, smoking was a predictor of low birth weight. Mean birth weight in children of smokers in medical treatment was significantly reduced by 274 g compared with children of non-smokers who received medical treatment. In children of women without medical treatment, this difference was 126 g between smokers and non-smokers. Women in medical treatment did not have an increased risk of preterm delivery (POR 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-2.79), congenital malformations (POR 0.60; 0.10-3.76) or cesarean section (POR 1.40; 0.63-3.08). CONCLUSIon. In CD, smoking was negatively associated with child birth weight. This association was most pronounced among women who received medical treatment. Maternal medical treatment for CD did not seem to be a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417179","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.766623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.761972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.702796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.558024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.548814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.472036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.439055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
