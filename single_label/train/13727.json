{"id":13727,"title":"Protective effects of Althaea officinalis L. extract in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced hemi-Parkinsonism model: behavioral, biochemical and histochemical evidence.","abstract":"It is well known that Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in humans. In this regard, the neuroprotective effect of Althaea officinalis (AO) has already been reported. Therefore, this study examined whether administration of AO extract would improve behavioral, biochemical and structural abnormalities in an experimental animal model of PD in rats. For this purpose, we induced hemi-Parkinsonism by unilateral intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 8 ?g/5 ?l saline-ascorbate). The rats were pretreated i.p. with AO extract (10 mg/kg) started 6 days before surgery and continued until the 3rd day post-surgery. Regarding oxidative stress, brain MDA concentration (as a lipid peroxidation marker) increased significantly in the 6-OHDA-administered group in comparison with rats pretreated with AO extract. It was found that AO treatment attenuated rotational behavior in the 6-OHDA-administered group and protected the neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta against 6-OHDA toxicity. Overall, AO extract administration indicated neuroprotective effects against 6-OHDA-induced hemi-Parkinsonism in rats.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464760","annotations":[{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.890526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Substantia nigra","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantia_nigra"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.309085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Pars compacta","weight":0.0239124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_compacta"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
