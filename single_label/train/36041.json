{"id":36041,"title":"[Influence of immunovac-VP-4 therapy on innate immunity effectors in patients with darier erythema annulare centrifugum].","abstract":"Detection of features of functioning ofinnate and adaptive immunity pathways in patients with Darier erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC).14 EAC patients aged 14 - 52 years were examined. The patients were ranked based on therapy variant. The first group consisted of 6 patients who had received Immunovac-VP-4 (Immunovac) against the background of basic therapy; the second group (4 patients) received cagocel against the background of basic therapy; the third group (4 patients) received only basic therapy; the group of healthy individuals consisted of 15 individuals. All the patients had the level ofcytokines in blood sera determined by solid-phase EIA by using Biosource (Austria) test-systems. Evaluation of TLR expression in peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes and keratinocytes was carried out by flow cytometry method by using monoclonal antibodies (Catlag Laboratories, USA) against the corresponding antigens; evaluation of content of lymphocyte subpopulations in blood was carried out by using monoclonal antibodies by flow cytometry method on FacsCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA).Immunotherapy by Immunovac and cagocel facilitated the increase of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+. Immunovac facilitated a significant increase ofinitially low values ofCD25+, CD95+ and normalization of CD72+; normalization of IgM level. Immunovac increased the level of serum IL-2, induced the increase of IFN-gamma synthesis in contrast to cagocel and basic therapy, the administration of those caused its decrease. TGF-beta increased during the course of Immunovac immunotherapy and decreased during basic therapy. In the course of basic therapy a significant increase of initially high level ofcytokine IL-I beta was observed.Immunovac therapy resulted in correction of content of lymphocyte populations, sera cytokines, facilitating the normalization of immunocompetent cell proliferation processes, activation of NK-cells, macrophages and at the same time suppression of DTH reactions. Immunovac facilitated the enhancement ofTLR3, 9 expression in the skin that indicates the inclusion ofintracellular receptor mechanisms of innate immunity.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
