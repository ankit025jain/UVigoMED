{"id":89101,"title":"[Advances and new ideas of neurobiology scaffold in repair of nerve injury].","abstract":"Nerve injury including peripheral nerve injury and central nerve injury has been a global problem. With the development of technology, many innovative approaches for nerve repair have been tested and some of the results are meaningful. It becomes a hot point that repair nerve injured by biological scaffold (nerve conduit). This article reviewed and analyzed several kinds of biological scaffold materials and microenvironment with better effect in recent years. Some new ideas were raised from the three aspects: appropriate materials, microstructure, and bionic microenvironment. It is better to combine multiple measures and achieve the best effect. In addition, nerve scaffold have a bright future in repair of central nervous system.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754157","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.492382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.368885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Bionics","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve injury","weight":0.0688939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve_injury"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Microstructure","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstructure"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
