{"id":55227,"title":"The neovascular age-related macular degeneration database: report 2: incidence, management, and visual outcomes of second treated eyes.","abstract":"To study the characteristics of second treated eyes in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with ranibizumab in the United Kingdom National Health Service.Multicenter national nAMD database study.Twelve thousand nine hundred fifty-one treatment-na√Øve eyes of 11,135 patients receiving 92,976 ranibizumab injections.Up to 5 years of routinely collected, anonymized data within electronic medical record systems were extracted remotely from 14 centers. Participating centers exclusively used ranibizumab to treat nAMD (loading phase of 3 monthly injections followed by monthly visits and pro re nata re-treatment). The minimum data set included: age, logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (VA) at baseline and at all subsequent visits, and injection episodes.Baseline, change and actual VA over 3 years, and number of treatments and clinic visits.During the study, 1816 (16.3%) of the 11 135 patients received treatment to the fellow eye. Mean baseline and final VA were 0.66 (standard deviation, 0.32) and 0.65 (0.40) for first treated eyes and 0.41 (0.34) and 0.56 (0.40) for second treated eyes. The rate of VA loss after the loading phase was similar in first and second treated eyes (0.03 and 0.05 logMAR units/year). When fellow eyes with baseline VA worse than 20/200 were excluded to restrict analyses to eyes at risk of nAMD, the rate of second-eye involvement was 14.0% per year (42%/3 years). Mean number of injections/visits in years 1, 2, and 3 were similar for first and second treated eyes (5.6/8.2, 3.9/8.0, 3.8/8.2 and 5.5/8.7, 3.6/9.4, and 3.8/9.1, respectively).Second treated eyes with nAMD commence treatment with better baseline VA, do not show significant vision gain but maintain better VA than first treated eyes at all time points for at least 3 years, making them the more important eye functionally. These data highlight the high burden of second eye involvement, with almost half of all eyes at risk requiring bilateral treatment by 3 years, and the need for regular monitoring of fellow eyes for best visual outcomes which theoretically may reduce the benefits of extended monitoring regimens.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Eye
