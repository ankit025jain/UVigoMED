{"id":67160,"title":"Robotic extramucosal excision of bladder wall leiomyoma.","abstract":"Multiple case reports and reviews have been described in the literature for bladder wall leiomyoma resection via different approaches. The minimally invasive partial cystectomy remains the most widely accepted technique; however, case reports for enucleation of bladder wall leiomyoma have also been described. The purpose of this video is to demonstrate the robotic extramucosal excision of a bladder wall leiomyoma, without cystotomy, but with complete removal of the muscular layer.A 35-year old male present with lower urinary tract symptoms and imaging showed bladder wall mass with histopathology showed leiomyoma. The patient consented for mass excision with the possibility of a partial cystectomy. The patient was placed in the supine, 30-degree Trendelenburg position during the procedure. A total of 4 ports were inserted. A 3-arm da Vinci robotic surgical system was docked, and the arms were connected. Extramucosal excision was accomplished without cystotomy and muscle approximation was achieved by 2 0 Vicryle.The operative time was 90 minutes, blood loss of approximately 50mL and the patient was discharged after 72 hours with no immediate complications and a 6 months follow-up showed no recurrence.Such a technique results in complete excision of the tumor, without cystotomy, and also maintains an intact mucosa. These steps, in addition to decreasing the risk of local recurrence, also shorten the period of postoperative catheterization and hospitalization.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642161","annotations":[{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.90264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.662331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.591938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.440975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.220694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Robotic surgery","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_surgery"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.081755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Leonardo da Vinci","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Trendelenburg position","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trendelenburg_position"},{"name":"Da Vinci Surgical System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Muscular layer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_layer"},{"name":"Docking (animal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(animal)"}]}
