{"id":77407,"title":"Narcolepsy and predictors of positive MSLTs in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort.","abstract":"To study whether positive multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs, mean sleep latency [MSL] ? 8 minutes, ? 2 sleep onset REM sleep periods [SOREMPs]) and/or nocturnal SOREMP (REM sleep latency ? 15 minutes during nocturnal polysomonography [NPSG]) are stable traits and can reflect incipient narcolepsy.Cross-sectional and longitudinal investigation of the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study.Adults (44% females, 30-81 years) underwent NPSG (n = 4,866 in 1,518 subjects), and clinical MSLT (n = 1,135), with 823 having a repeat NPSG-MSLT at 4-year intervals, totaling 1725 NPSG with MSLT studies. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, and the stability of positive MSLTs was explored using ? statistics.Prevalence of a nocturnal SOREMP on a NPSG, of ? 2 SOREMPs on the MSLT, of MSL ? 8 minutes on the MSLT, and of a positive MSLT (MSL ? 8 minutes plus ? 2 SOREMPs) were 0.35%, 7.0%, 22%, and 3.4%, respectively. Correlates of a positive MSLT were shift work (OR = 7.8, P = 0.0001) and short sleep (OR = 1.51/h, P = 0.04). Test-retest for these parameters was poor, with ? < 0.2 (n.s.) after excluding shift workers and short sleepers. Excluding shift-work, short sleep, and subjects with negative MSLTs, we found one undiagnosed subject with possible cataplexy (? 1/month) and a NPSG SOREMPs; one subject previously diagnosed with narcolepsy without cataplexy with 2 NPSG SOREMPs and a positive MSLT, and two subjects with 2 independently positive MSLTs (66% human leukocyte antigen [HLA] positive). The proportions for narcolepsy with and without cataplexy were 0.07% (95% CI: 0.02-0.37%) and 0.20% (95% CI: 0.07-0.58%), respectively.The diagnostic value of multiple sleep latency tests is strongly altered by shift work and to a lesser extent by chronic sleep deprivation. The prevalence of narcolepsy without cataplexy may be 3-fold higher than that of narcolepsy-cataplexy.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882899","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Narcolepsy","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcolepsy"},{"name":"Sleep deprivation","weight":0.838771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.798844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.742918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.574975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.487328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.47851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.441528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cataplexy","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataplexy"},{"name":"Sleep onset latency","weight":0.171124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_onset_latency"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Wisconsin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"1725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1725"},{"name":"823","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/823"},{"name":"866","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/866"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Trait theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Sea level","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Railroad tie","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_tie"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"IBM 3081","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3081"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"}]}
