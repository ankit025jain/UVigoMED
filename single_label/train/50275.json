{"id":50275,"title":"Can single-phase dual-energy CT reliably identify adrenal adenomas?","abstract":"To evaluate whether single-phase dual-energy-CT-based attenuation measurements can reliably differentiate lipid-rich adrenal adenomas from malignant adrenal lesions.We retrospectively identified 51 patients with adrenal masses who had undergone contrast-enhanced dual-energy-CT (140/100 or 140/80 kVp). Virtual non-contrast and colour-coded iodine images were generated, allowing for measurement of pre- and post-contrast density on a single-phase acquisition. Adrenal adenoma was diagnosed if density on virtual non-contrast images was ?10 HU. Clinical follow-up, true non-contrast CT, PET/CT, in- and opposed-phase MRI, and histopathology served as the standard of reference.Based on the standard of reference, 46/57 (80.7%) adrenal masses were characterised as adenomas or other benign lesions; 9 malignant lesions were detected. Based on a cutoff value of 10 HU, virtual non-contrast images allowed for correct identification of adrenal adenomas in 33 of 46 (71%), whereas 13/46 (28%) adrenal adenomas were lipid poor with a density ?10 HU. Based on the threshold of 10 HU on the virtual non-contrast images, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detection of benign adrenal lesions was 73%, 100%, and 81% respectively.Virtual non-contrast images derived from dual-energy-CT allow for accurate characterisation of lipid-rich adrenal adenomas and can help to avoid additional follow-up imaging.• Adrenal adenomas are a common lesion of the adrenal glands. • Differentiation of benign adrenal adenomas from malignant adrenal lesions is important. • Dual-energy based virtual non-contrast images help to evaluate patients with adrenal adenomas.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804633","annotations":[{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.699994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.571845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Adrenal adenoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_adenoma"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1346","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1346"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Mass (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(music)"},{"name":"Can (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}]}
