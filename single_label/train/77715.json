{"id":77715,"title":"Matching evaluation between occupational contact dermatitis and various jobs in Yazd in during 2007-2012.","abstract":"Skin disorders comprise more than 35% of all occupationally related diseases. 90-95% of work-related dermatoses are contact dermatitis. Effects of occupational dermatitis in the lives of workers are substantial. To plan any preventive program we need basic statistics of the problem, that we had no reliable one which includes a lot of industries in Iran. Therefore we decided to determine occupational contact dermatitis, and it's subtypes prevalence in various jobs. The objective of this study is determination of occupational contact dermatitis, and it's subtypes prevalence and comparison among various jobs. In this cross -sectional study, we examined 3061 workers of various industries during 2007-2012 and recognized contact dermatitis cases. Irritant and allergic cases were separated according to clinical judgment of physician and patch test using European standard series. We found 271 (prevalence=8.8%) occupational contact dermatitis cases which 247 (91.1%) were irritant, and the rest were allergic. The highest prevalence was in washing powder production and then glaze and paint workers, mechanists and chemical workers were located. There is a great variability for occupational contact dermatitis in various industries and between different countries. These statistics changes during the time by changing in number of workers and their characteristics, variation in material and process and glove use situation. So every country must have a national data bank of occupational contact dermatitis, which must be updated after a period of time.","date":"2014-01-06","categories":"Occupational
