{"id":50974,"title":"Association of hematological parameters with insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"Previous studies reported independent associations of hematological parameters with insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to explore the associations of hematological parameters, including red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hgb), white blood cell count (WBC), and platelets with insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes.Study included 353 patients with type 1 diabetes. None showed signs of acute or chronic inflammatory, renal and cardiovascular diseases. Insulin sensitivity was measured with estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) calculated with the equation: eGDR=24.31-(12.22xWHR)-(3.29xAHT)-(0.57xHbA1c). The units were mg.kg-1min-1; WHR=waist to hip ratio; AHT=hypertension.RBC, Hgb, and WBC significantly correlated with insulin resistance measured by eGDR (r=-0.12, -0.21, and -0.14, respectively, all P?0.01), and its components disorders, most notably WHR (r=0.38, 0.44, and 0.16, respectively, all P?0.001). In a multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, sex, duration of diabetes and BMI, the presence of insulin resistance was independently associated with WBC count (odds ratio=1.28, P<0.01). The risk of insulin resistance increases by a factor of 4.41 for those in the 4th quartile of WBC, compared to those in 1st quartile.The significant independent association of WBC with the presence of insulin resistance suggests a role of subclinical inflammation in its pathogenesis.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736486","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.874738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.840535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.797476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.763568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.718697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.618664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.572859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.409126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.331777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.171856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0940019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"White blood cell count","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell_count"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"}]}
