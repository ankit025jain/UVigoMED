{"id":68325,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of primary screening for CKD: a systematic review.","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health problem with an increasing incidence worldwide. Data on the cost-effectiveness of CKD screening in the general population have been conflicting.Systematic review.General, hypertensive, and diabetic populations. No restriction on setting.Studies that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening for CKD.Screening for CKD by proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening by proteinuria or eGFR compared with either no screening or usual care.9 studies met criteria for inclusion. 8 studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of proteinuria screening and 2 evaluated screening with eGFR. For proteinuria screening, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $14,063-$160,018/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in the general population, $5,298-$54,943/QALY in the diabetic population, and $23,028-$73,939/QALY in the hypertensive population. For eGFR screening, one study reported a cost of $23,680/QALY in the diabetic population and the range across the 2 studies was $100,253-$109,912/QALY in the general population. The incidence of CKD, rate of progression, and effectiveness of drug therapy were major drivers of cost-effectiveness.Few studies evaluated screening by eGFR. Performance of a quantitative meta-analysis on influential assumptions was not conducted because of few available studies and heterogeneity in model designs.Screening for CKD is suggested to be cost-effective in patients with diabetes and hypertension. CKD screening may be cost-effective in populations with higher incidences of CKD, rapid rates of progression, and more effective drug therapy.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529536","annotations":[{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.730905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Quality-adjusted life year","weight":0.370684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.144383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
