{"id":74740,"title":"Target-responsive DNA-capped nanocontainer used for fabricating universal detector and performing logic operations.","abstract":"Nucleic acids have become a powerful tool in nanotechnology because of their controllable diverse conformational transitions and adaptable higher-order nanostructure. Using single-stranded DNA probes as the pore-caps for various target recognition, here we present an ultrasensitive universal electrochemical detection system based on graphene and mesoporous silica, and achieve sensitivity with all of the major classes of analytes and simultaneously realize DNA logic gate operations. The concept is based on the locking of the pores and preventing the signal-reporter molecules from escape by target-induced the conformational change of the tailored DNA caps. The coupling of 'waking up' gatekeeper with highly specific biochemical recognition is an innovative strategy for the detection of various targets, able to compete with classical methods which need expensive instrumentation and sophisticated experimental operations. The present study has introduced a new electrochemical signal amplification concept and also adds a new dimension to the function of graphene-mesoporous materials hybrids as multifunctional nanoscale logic devices. More importantly, the development of this approach would spur further advances in important areas, such as point-of-care diagnostics or detection of specific biological contaminations, and hold promise for use in field analysis.","date":"2014-11-28","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249622","annotations":[{"name":"Logic
