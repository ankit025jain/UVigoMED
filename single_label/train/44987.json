{"id":44987,"title":"Alpha fetoprotein DNA prime and adenovirus boost immunization of two hepatocellular cancer patients.","abstract":"Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is an oncofetal antigen over-expressed by many hepatocellular cancers (HCC). We previously demonstrated that HLA-A2-restricted epitopes derived from AFP are immunogenic in vitro and in vivo despite high circulating levels of this oncofetal antigen. In order to test a more broadly applicable, HLA-unrestricted, inexpensive, cell-free vaccine platform capable of activating tumor antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, we tested full length AFP in a plasmid DNA construct in combination with an AFP-expressing replication-deficient adenovirus (AdV) in a prime-boost vaccine strategy.HCC patients who had an AFP+ tumor and previous treatment for HCC were screened and two patients received vaccination with three plasmid DNA injections followed by a single AdV injection, all delivered intramuscularly (i.m.).The vaccine was well tolerated and safe. Both patients showed immunologic evidence of immunization. The first patient had a weak AFP-specific T cell response, a strong AdV-specific cellular response and recurred with an AFP-expressing HCC at nine months. The second patient developed a strong AFP-specific CD8+ and CD4+ cellular response and an AdV neutralizing antibody response, and recurred at 18Â months without an increase in serum AFP.The AFP DNA prime-AdV boost vaccine was safe and immunogenic. Circulating anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies at baseline did not prohibit the development of AFP-specific cellular immunity. The patient who developed CD8+ and CD4+ AFP-specific T cell immunity had more favorable progression-free survival. The observations with these two patients support development of this vaccine strategy in a larger clinical trial.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708667","annotations":[{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.842255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Cell-mediated immunity","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell-mediated_immunity"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.394432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.238197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"}]}
