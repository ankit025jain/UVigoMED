{"id":89867,"title":"Revisiting the effects of self-protective behaviors on the risk of injury in assaults against women.","abstract":"Using data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS; 1992-2005), we closely examined the effects of victims' self-protective actions on the risk of injury among female nonsexual assault victims. Building on previous research, we focused on 3 important methodological and conceptual issues: (a) gradational coding of the 16 different NCVS self-protective actions, (b) separate analyses of serious injuries, and (c) the victim-offender relationship. Our analyses demonstrated that the risk of injury was strongly and positively associated with the degree of forcefulness of self-protective actions. Furthermore, the likelihood of victim injury was inversely related to the relational distance between the victim and the offender.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673001","annotations":[{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.696382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.402293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Assault","weight":0.378001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"National Crime Victimization Survey","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Victimization_Survey"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Platonic love","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love"},{"name":"Victimisation","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimisation"}]}
