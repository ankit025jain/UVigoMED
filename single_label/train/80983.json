{"id":80983,"title":"[Effects of different prevention and control measures on schistosomiasis prevalence in different limnetic regions].","abstract":"To compare the schistosomiasis control effects of the comprehensive control measures based on infectious resources control and the conventional control measures, so as to provide the evidence for improving prevention and control strategies.In the Hanbei River basin, the comprehensive control measures based on infectious resources control (conventional measures plus grazing prohibition in the marshland, machine instead of cattle, and marshland development, and so on) were carned out, and in the Nanzhi River basin, the conventional control measures were performed. The schistosomiasis epidemic data were collected, analyzed and compared from 2004 to 2011.In 2004, the infection rate of the populations and cattle in Nanzhi River basin was lower than that in the Hanbei River basin. From 2004 to 2011, the Oncomelania hupensis snail frame occurrence rate and the average density of living snails in the Nanzhi River basin was lower than that in the non-ploughing marshland and preventing wave woods of the Hanbei River basin, and there were schistosome infected snails in the Nanzhi River basin. From 2008 to 2010, there were no infected snails in the non-ploughing marshland of the Hanbei River basin. From 2007, the cattle have been eliminated in the Hanbei River basin. From 2007 to 2011, there were no infected snails in the preventing wave woods of the Hanbei River, but there were schistosome infected cattle found by stool examinations every year in the Nanzhi River basin. From 2004 to 2011, the infection rates of population presented downward trends in the two river basins, but the downward trend was more significant in the Hanbei River basin than in the Nanzhi River basin.The conventional control measures and comprehensive control measures based on infectious resources control are both effective, but the latter is more effective.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490365","annotations":[{"name":"Fresh water","weight":0.655105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"River","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.504371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.445022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Marsh","weight":0.392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh"},{"name":"Grazing","weight":0.351051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.265937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.264512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.200786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Woodland","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Prohibition","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Control system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
