{"id":82997,"title":"Head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma requiring parotidectomy: prognostic indicators and treatment selection.","abstract":"Evaluate characteristics and risk factors for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).Retrospective case series.Tertiary care center.Chart review of patients with cSCC undergoing a parotidectomy (2003-2012).Of 218 patients identified, 49% presented with a new primary lesion (n = 107) and 51% with a recurrence (n = 111). Parotid lymph nodes were positive in 52% of patients; 81% had a concurrent neck dissection, and 28% had cervical lymph node metastases. In 18% of patients, both parotid and cervical nodes were positive, while 44% were both parotid and cervical node negative; 33% had positive parotid and negative cervical nodes, and only 5% had negative parotid and positive cervical nodes. The overall 2- and 5-year survival rates were 0.71 and 0.58. Overall 5-year survival was lower for patients presenting with recurrent (0.49) versus new primary disease (0.69; P = .04). In addition, decreased overall 5-year survival rates were associated with cervical lymph node involvement (0.47 vs. 0.62; P = .01). There was no difference in overall survival when stratified by parotid lymph node involvement (P = .85), margin status (P = .67), perineural invasion (P = .42), facial nerve sacrifice (P = .92), or type of parotid operation performed (P = .51).In this study, cervical, but not parotid, lymph node involvement was associated with poor outcomes in patients with advanced cSCC requiring a parotidectomy. In patients without evidence of cervical or parotid lymph node involvement, a neck dissection may be spared, given there is a 5% chance of occult disease.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474713","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.897476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.787344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.778993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.663323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.509965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.479809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.228919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.22231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Perineural invasion","weight":0.217756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineural_invasion"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0725953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Perineurium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineurium"},{"name":"Stratified squamous epithelium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_squamous_epithelium"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
