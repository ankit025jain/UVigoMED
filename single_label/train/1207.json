{"id":1207,"title":"[Tricuspid valve plasty using autologous pericardium in a patient with infective endocarditis].","abstract":"A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed with infective endocarditis. She had no history of any cardiac event or dental treatment. Echocardiography showed a large vegetation attached to the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Surgery consisted of removal of the vegetation and tricuspid valve plasty with a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch and artificial chordae of the anterior leaflet. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Five years after surgery, neither recurrence of infection nor worsening of tricuspid regurgitation was noted.
