{"id":46497,"title":"[The RENAPE network: towards a new healthcare organization for the treatment of rare tumors of the peritoneum. Description of the network and role of the pathologists].","abstract":"As part of the national 2009-2013 Cancer Plan, and with the support of the National cancer Institute and the French ministry of health, the National network for the treatment of rare peritoneal malignancies (RENAPE) has been organized. Its main objective is to optimize the framework for the healthcare management and treatment of rare peritoneal malignancies. This specific organization covers the whole national territory including clinical expert and specialized structures and should lead to an appropriate treatment based on expertise and proximity. Within the RENAPE network, the RENA-PATH group gathers the pathologists actively involved in the management of rare peritoneal malignancies. The actions of RENA-PATH are focused primarily on the harmonization of pathological diagnostic criteria, reporting of new cases in the RENAPE registry and histology reviewing.
