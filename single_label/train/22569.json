{"id":22569,"title":"Low compliance with national guidelines for preventing transmission of group 1 nationally notifiable infectious diseases in Korea.","abstract":"This study was performed to evaluate the compliance with, and adequacy of, the Korean national guidelines which had been recommended until 2011 for isolation of patients with group 1 nationally notifiable infectious diseases (NNIDs), namely cholera, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, shigellosis, and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection.We evaluated the clinical and microbiological characteristics of confirmed cases of group 1 NNIDs and compliance with the guidelines in 20 Korean hospitals nationwide in 2000-2010. We also compared the Korean guidelines with international guidelines.Among 528 confirmed cases (8 cases of cholera, 232 of typhoid fever, 81 of paratyphoid fever, 175 of shigellosis, and 32 EHEC infections), strict compliance with the Korean guideline was achieved in only 2.6% to 50.0%, depending on the disease. While the Korean guidelines recommend isolation of all patients with group 1 NNIDs, international guidelines recommend selective patient isolation and screening for fecal shedding, depending on the type of disease and patient status.Compliance with the previous national guidelines for group 1 NNIDs in Korea was generally very low. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether compliance was improved after implementation of the new guideline in 2012.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532515","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Typhoid fever","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"},{"name":"Shigellosis","weight":0.878497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigellosis"},{"name":"Cholera","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.45914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.409082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.219691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.055812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Paratyphoid fever","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratyphoid_fever"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Viral shedding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding"}]}
