{"id":20856,"title":"Invasive fungal infections in liver transplant recipients.","abstract":"We sought to assess the incidence of invasive fungal infections and identify the risk factors and outcome of invasive fungal infections in liver transplant recipient.A retrospective analysis was made of 408 patients who received a liver transplant between January 1990 to December 2012 at Baskent University in Ankara, Turkey. Only 305 of 408 patients were included. Demographic and clinical findings were reviewed, and these findings were compared between patients with or without invasive fungal infections.Ten of 408 liver transplant patients (2.5%) developed invasive fungal infections. Aspergillus was the most common cause of invasive fungal infections (n=8), followed by Candida (n=1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (n=1). Pulmonary involvement was dominant in all patients (n=10), and only 1 patient had disseminated fungal infection (cryptococcosis). The mean time from transplant to invasive fungal infection diagnosis was 32 ± 19.2 days. Most patients with invasive fungal infection (9/10) died. Mean survival time between diagnosis of fungal infection and death was 24.2 ± 27.3 days in all 10 patients. Fungal infections occurred significantly more frequently in patients with older transplant age, diabetes mellitus, cytomegalovirus infection, renal insufficiency. In addition, other risk factors included long stays in the surgical intensive care unit, the overall length of stay in hospital, and having preoperative high creatinine level.Invasive fungal infections were associated with increased morbidity and mortality among liver transplant recipients, with Aspergillus spp. being the most common pathogen in our series. Because of its high mortality rate, it is important to follow up transplant patients for the development of invasive fungal infections.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635806","annotations":[{"name":"Cryptococcus neoformans","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_neoformans"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.801005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Cryptococcosis","weight":0.800668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcosis"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.723035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.707981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.685513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cryptococcus","weight":0.467266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.401598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.360022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.346553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.344744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Aspergillus","weight":0.333646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
