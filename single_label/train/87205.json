{"id":87205,"title":"Efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C genotype 6: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Hepatitis C genotype 6 (HCV-6) is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Data on the efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agents in chronic HCV-6 patients is limited and pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy remains standard therapy for those patients.Meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of Peg-IFN plus RBV combination therapy for chronic HCV-6 patients.Relevant studies were found by database search through Medline, Embase, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library. All published clinical trials assessing the efficacy of Peg-IFN plus RBV combination therapy for chronic HCV-6 patients were included. Sustained virological response rate (SVR) was pooled. We performed additional meta-analyses to compare the SVR outcomes of 24 versus 48 weeks of treatment in four head-to-head trials. Another second meta-analysis was also conducted to compare the efficacy of combination Peg-IFN plus RBV therapy in HCV-6 versus HCV-1 patients.Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled SVR of all single arms was 75% (95% CI: 0.68-0.81). The SVR of 24 weeks treatment was significantly lower than that at 48 weeks, with a risk difference of -14% (95% CI: -0.25 to -0.02, p?=?0.02). However, when restricted to the patients with rapid virological response (RVR), there was no significant effect on SVR between these two treatment groups, with a risk difference of -1% (95% CI: -0.1 to 0.07, p?=?0.67). The SVR in HCV-6 patients was significantly higher than that in HCV-1 patients, with a relative risk of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.16-1.57, p<0.001). Side effects were common, but rarely caused treatment discontinuation.The results of this meta-analysis suggest that Peg-IFN plus RBV is effective and safe for HCV-6 patients. Shortening treatment seems to be feasible in HCV-6 patients with RVR when tolerance to treatment is poor. However, this decision should be made cautiously.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24963667","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.88562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.694916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.686484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.510248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.506262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.419125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.408763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.231296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0227032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
