{"id":30135,"title":"Assessing student pharmacists' ability to identify drug-related problems in patients within a patient-centered medical home.","abstract":"To quantify, describe, and categorize patient drug-related problems (DRPs) and recommendations identified by fourth-year (P4) student pharmacists during a live medication reconciliation activity within a patient-centered medical home (PCMH).Fourth-year student pharmacists conducted chart reviews, identified and documented DRPs, obtained live medication histories, and immediately provided findings and recommendations to the attending physicians. Documentation of DRPs and recommendations were analyzed retrospectively.Thirty-eight students completed 99 medication reconciliation sessions from June 2011 to October 2012 during their advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE). The students obtained 676 patient medication histories and identified or intervened on 1308 DRPs. The most common DRPs reported were incomplete medication list and diagnostic/laboratory testing needed. Physicians accepted 1,018 (approximately 78%) recommendations.Student pharmacists successfully identified and reduced DRPs through a live medication reconciliation process within an academic-based PCMH model. Their medication history-taking skills improved and medication use was optimized.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558274","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.378002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Pharmacy practice","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy_practice"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Medical home","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_home"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"1308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1308"},{"name":"Reconciliation (United States Congress)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconciliation_(United_States_Congress)"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Conflict resolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
