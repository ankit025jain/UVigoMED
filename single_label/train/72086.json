{"id":72086,"title":"SIRT6: a promising target for cancer prevention and therapy.","abstract":"Many of the pathologies associated with the aging process also contribute to tumor initiation, growth or metastasis. Insights from biogerontology may be instrumental for developing new therapies for cancer. This chapter highlights the rationale for combining biogerontology and cancer research to generate new strategies for cancer treatment. In particular, this chapter focuses on one gene, SIRT6, which has emerged as an important regulator of longevity in mammals and appears to have multiple biochemical functions, which antagonize tumor development and may be useful in cancer prevention and treatment.
