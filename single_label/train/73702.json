{"id":73702,"title":"The Children's Oncology Group Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN): case catchment in the United States.","abstract":"The Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) was established within the Children's Oncology Group (COG) in July 2008 to provide a centralized pediatric cancer research registry for investigators conducting approved etiologic and survivorship studies. The authors conducted an ecological analysis to characterize CCRN catchment at >200 COG institutions by demographic characteristics, diagnosis, and geographic location to determine whether the CCRN can serve as a population-based registry for childhood cancer.During 2009 to 2011, 18,580 US children newly diagnosed with cancer were registered in the CCRN. These observed cases were compared with age-specific, sex-specific, and race/ethnicity-specific expected numbers calculated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program cancer incidence rates and 2010 US Census data.Overall, 42% of children (18,580 observed/44,267 expected) who were diagnosed with cancer at age <20 years were registered in the CCRN, including 45%, 57%, 51%, 44%, and 24% of those diagnosed at birth, ages 1 to 4 years, ages 5 to 9 years, ages 10 to 14 years, and ages 15 to 19 years, respectively. Some malignancies were better represented in the CCRN (leukemia, 59%; renal tumors, 67%) than others (retinoblastoma, 34%). There was little evidence of differences by sex or race/ethnicity, although rates in nonwhites were somewhat lower than rates in whites.Given the low observed-to-expected ratio, it will be important to identify challenges and barriers to registration to improve case ascertainment, especially for rarer diagnoses and older age groups; however, it is encouraging that some diagnoses in younger children are fairly representative of the population. Overall, the CCRN is providing centralized, real-time access to cases for research and could be used as a model for other national cooperative groups.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24889136","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma","weight":0.657184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.646945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.597719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.548517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.542669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.530912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.414518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.310198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.19543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.122128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cancer research","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"2010 United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_Epidemiology_and_End_Results"}]}
