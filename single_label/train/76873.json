{"id":76873,"title":"Binge eating behavior and weight loss maintenance over a 2-year period.","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between binge eating behavior and weight loss maintenance over a two-year period in adults.Secondary data analysis using the Keep It Off study, a randomized trial evaluating an intervention to promote weight loss maintenance.419 men and women (ages: 20 to 70?y; BMI: 20-44?kg/m2) who had intentionally lost ?10% of their weight during the previous year.Body weight was measured and binge eating behavior over the past 6 months was reported at baseline, 12 months and 24 months. Height was measured at baseline.Prevalence of binge eating at baseline was 19.4% (n = 76). Prevalence of binge eating at any time point was 30.1% (n = 126). Although rate of weight regain did not differ significantly between those who did or did not report binge eating at baseline, binge eating behavior across the study period (additive value of presence or absence at each time point) was significantly associated with different rates of weight regain.Tailoring weight loss maintenance interventions to address binge eating behavior is warranted given the prevalence and the different rates of weight regain experienced by those reporting this behavior.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891946","annotations":[{"name":"Weight","weight":0.476528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.34466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.258198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.0574438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Binge eating","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"2044","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2044"},{"name":"Height","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Tailor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor"},{"name":"Match fixing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Secondary data","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_data"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
