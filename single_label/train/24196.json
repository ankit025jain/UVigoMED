{"id":24196,"title":"Evaluation of various silver-containing dressing on infected excision wound healing study.","abstract":"Silver-containing dressings have been widely used for controlling wound infection. However, the relationship between different concentrations of silver in dressings and their antimicrobial activities and wound-healing efficacies remains unclear. In the present study, we (in cooperation with Bio-medical Carbon Technology) investigated various silver-containing activated carbon fibers to understand the effects of different silver concentrations on the efficacies of a silver containing dressing. Our results indicated that various silver-containing activated carbon fibers exhibited good antibacterial effects and biocompatibility in terms of cell viability and that silver concentration showed a minor influence on cell growth. The infected excision wound model indicated that compared to silver-containing activated carbon fiber and other commercial silver-containing dressings assisted wound healing by promoting granulation and collagen deposition. Meanwhile, the silver ion can only be restrained in epidermis by intact skin. During application on the wound area, a temporary increase of serum silver can be detected, but this elevated serum silver level decreased to a subtle level after the removal of silver-containing activated carbon fiber.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449026","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.775346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.698671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.618146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.575529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Activated carbon","weight":0.480374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_carbon"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.249844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.223495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Carbon (fiber)","weight":0.114014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_(fiber)"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Deposition (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(geology)"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"}]}
