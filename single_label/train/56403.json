{"id":56403,"title":"Comparison of the Richmond HRR 4th edition and Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test for quantitative assessment of tritan color deficiencies.","abstract":"Drugs and environmental factors can induce tritan deficiencies. The Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100 Hue Test has become the gold standard in measuring these acquired defects. However, the test is time consuming, and color discrimination is confounded by concentration and patience. Here, we describe a test that compares six tritan plates from the HRR Pseudoisochromatic Plates 4th edition to 16 FM 100 Hue tritan caps. CIE Standard Illuminant C was reduced over five light intensities to simulate the effects of acquired losses in the S-cone pathway. Both tests showed quantitative differences in error rates with all light levels; thus they could serve equally well for assessing acquired deficiencies. However, compared to the FM 100, the HRR took subjects about 20-40 s per trial, making it more practical.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695168","annotations":[{"name":"Color","weight":0.424639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"FM broadcasting","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"International Commission on Illumination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Illumination"},{"name":"Scone, Scotland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scone,_Scotland"},{"name":"Color blindness","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Environmentalism","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism"},{"name":"Hue","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"2040","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2040"},{"name":"Shilling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Trail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"Standard illuminant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant"},{"name":"Richmond, Virginia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Patience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"WMC-FM","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMC-FM"}]}
