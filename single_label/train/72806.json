{"id":72806,"title":"Immunotherapy for high-grade glioma.","abstract":"4th Quadrennial Meeting of the World Federation of Neuro-Oncology in conjunction with the 18th Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuro-Oncology, San Francisco, CA, USA, 21-24 November 2013. Aside from temozolomide, there has been no major breakthrough for decades to improve outcome for high-grade glioma. Bevacizumab failed to show a survival advantage in two large studies - AVaglio and RTOG-0825 - and no other novel chemotherapy agents seem to be appearing on the horizon for this universally fatal disease. Consequently, the neuro-oncology fraternity is turning to immunotherapy. This became apparent in this meeting, considering a number of delegates focused their attention to presentations on immunotherapy. The ReACT study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the combination of a promising peptide vaccine, rindopepimut, and bevacizumab with longer survival seen in patients with a higher antibody titer. Several presentations reassured that dendritic cell-based immunotherapy is safe and can generate a lasting immune response. Employing gene therapy, increased intratumor 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy concentration can be achieved using TOCA 511, and temozolomide-resistant transgenic lymphocytes could be produced through retroviral coding. Blocking immune checkpoints PDL-01, CTLA-4 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase through monoclonal antibodies appears promising.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941977","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Temozolomide","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temozolomide"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Retrovirus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.735843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.41087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.406117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.346988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"San Francisco","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.286224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Survival of the fittest","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"CTLA-4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTLA-4"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
