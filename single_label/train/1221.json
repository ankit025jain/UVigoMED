{"id":1221,"title":"[Role of adherence to long-term drug therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease: an Italian intersocietary consensus document].","abstract":"Chronic therapy with statins, antihypertensive and antiplatelet drugs is one of the most important interventions for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Adherence to drug treatment is key to successful therapeutic intervention, especially in chronic conditions. This holds particularly true in the setting of cardiovascular diseases, because poor adherence may have serious adverse effects in terms of morbidity and mortality. Many factors may contribute to poor adherence, which can be either patient-related or dependent on the healthcare system, the physician and the environment. The identification and appropriate correction of these factors may result in both clinical and economic benefits. In this setting it is also important to assess the implications of the increasing use of generic or equivalent drugs on adherence to pharmacological therapy.
