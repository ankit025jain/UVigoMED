{"id":60223,"title":"Complement, cold agglutinins, and therapy.","abstract":"In this issue of Blood, Shi and coworkers show that TNT003, a mouse monoclonal antibody targeting complement protein C1s, prevents induction of in vitro hemolysis by cold agglutinins (CA). If successfully transferred into the clinical setting by further studies, these findings may result in a novel therapeutic principle for a frequently difficult problem.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970929","annotations":[{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.660353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cold agglutinin disease","weight":0.576896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_agglutinin_disease"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Agglutination (biology)","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination_(biology)"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Trinitrotoluene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrotoluene"},{"name":"Protein C","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_C"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Complement component 1s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_1s"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
