{"id":79470,"title":"[The expression of caspase-3, bFGF and MVD in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and the relationship among them].","abstract":"To investigate the expression of Caspase-3 and bFGF in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and the affection angiogenesis.Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Caspase-3. bFGF and MVD in 36 cases of para-carcinoma tissue and 67 cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.The expression of bFGF in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma was significantly higher than that in para-carcinoma tissue (P < 0.05), however the expression of Caspase-3 was significantly higher in para-carcinoma tissue than that in Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.05). In laryngeal carcinoma, the expression of bFGF and Caspase-3 were associated with differentiation, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage (P < 0.05), but was independent of clinical classification,smoking history, sex and gender (P > 0.05). A significantly negative correlation was found between hFGF and Caspase-3 (P < 0.05). The value of MVD in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma was significantly higher than that in para-carcinoma tissue (P < 0.05), and was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05), but not associated with age, gender, differentiation, clinical stage, clinical classification or smoking history. The MVD of the tissue with positive expression of bFGF was significantly higher than that with negative expression of bFGF in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the MVI) of the tissue with positive expression of bFGF and that with negative expression of bFGF in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (P > 0.05).bFGF was positively related to Caspase-3, which might play an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of laryngeal carcinoma by synergic effect.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417169","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.773001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.726972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.70345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.515943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.507173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.266338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.252069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Basic fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
