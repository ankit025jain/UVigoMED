{"id":45523,"title":"Gastric ESD: current status and future directions of devices and training.","abstract":"Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of early gastric cancer, which has been proved to be safe and effective and is the established standard of care in Japan, has become increasingly established worldwide in the past decade. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is superior to EMR, as it is designed to provide precise pathologic staging and long-term curative therapy based on an en bloc R0 specimen irrespective of the size and/or location of the tumor. However, ESD requires highly skilled and experienced endoscopists. The introduction of ESD to the Western world necessitates collaborations between Eastern and Western endoscopists, pathologists, and surgeons.
