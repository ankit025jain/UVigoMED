{"id":88836,"title":"Intimate partner violence and women's health and wellbeing: impacts, risk factors and responses.","abstract":"Women have approximately a one in four chance of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). Those who do are at increased risk of developing physical and mental health problems including traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance-related disorders. Nurses, in whatever situation they work, are therefore highly likely to encounter women who are victims of IPV. This paper explores the prevalence of physical and mental health issues for women with an experience of IPV. Factors that influence a woman's experience of IPV such as culture, remaining in an abusive relationship, and childhood sexual abuse as a risk factor of IPV are also examined. Recommended responses for women with an experience of IPV are discussed.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24787250","annotations":[{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.81484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Intimate relationship","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_relationship"},{"name":"Domestic violence","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Sexual abuse","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse"},{"name":"Child sexual abuse","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Physical abuse","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.542338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.500666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Relational aggression","weight":0.49216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_aggression"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.492032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.061187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Brain injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_injury"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"}]}
