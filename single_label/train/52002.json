{"id":52002,"title":"Urinary bisphenol a levels in girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty.","abstract":"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial chemical, particularly used to harden plastics. BPA is thought to have negative health effects on both laboratory animals and humans. Consider ing the decline in age of onset of puberty noted in recent years, particularly among girls, the importance of BPA as an estrogenic endocrine disruptor has increased. In this study, we aimed to determine urinary BPA levels in girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty (ICPP).Non-obese girls newly diagnosed with ICPP (n=28, age 4-8 years) constituted the study group. The control group consisted of 25 healthy age-matched girls with no history of ICPP or any other endocrine disorder. Urinary BPA levels were measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography.In the ICPP group, urinary BPA levels were significantly higher compared to the control group [median 8.34 (0.84-67.35) ?g/g creatinine and 1.62 (0.3-25.79) ?g/g creatinine, respectively (OR=8.68, 95% CI:2.03-32.72, p=0.001)]. There was no marked correlation between urinary BPA levels and body mass index in either group. In the ICPP group, no significant correlations were found between urinary BPA levels and serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels.To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the urinary BPA levels in Turkish girls with ICPP. Our results indicate that the estrogenic effects of BPA may be an etiologic factor in ICPP.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637305","annotations":[{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.862063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Endocrine disruptor","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disruptor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Endocrine disease","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disease"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.715306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.699962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Bisphenol A","weight":0.486689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.46748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Precocious puberty","weight":0.395556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_puberty"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.377115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.36041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.340323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.256056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.196183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.182304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chemical industry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
