{"id":91945,"title":"Difficulties in the diagnosis of vertebral fracture in men: agreement between doctors.","abstract":"The agreement for vertebral fracture (VF) diagnosis in men, between doctors is poor.To assess the agreement for VF diagnosis, in men, on standard radiographs, between experts, before and after consensual workshop and establishing an algorithm.The agreement between thirteen experimented rheumatologists has been calculated in thirty osteoporotic men. Then, the group discussed in a workshop and 28 other radiograph sets of osteoporotic men with follow-up radiographs and incident confirmed VF, have been reviewed. The experts identified and hierarchised 18 pathological features of vertebral deformation and established an algorithm of VF diagnosis. Eleven experts have realized a second reading of the first set of radiographs. We compared the agreement between the 2 readings without and with the algorithm.After consensus and the use of the algorithm the results are: number of fractured patients (with at least 1 VF) according to the experts varies from 13 to 26 patients out of 30 (13 to 28 during the first reading). The agreement between the experts at the patient level is 75% (70% at the first reading). Among the 390 vertebrae analyzed by the experts, the number of VF detected varies from 18 to 59 (18 to 98 at the first reading). The agreement between the experts at the vertebral level is 92% (89% at the first reading). The algorithm allows a good improvement of the agreement, especially for 8 of the 11 experts. Discrepancies for the VF diagnosis between experts exist. The algorithm improves the agreement.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462127","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.768809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.655992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.586164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.383653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Workshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop"},{"name":"Deformation (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Ventricular fibrillation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation"},{"name":"Reading (legislature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(legislature)"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Second reading","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_reading"}]}
