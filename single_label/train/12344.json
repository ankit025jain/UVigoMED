{"id":12344,"title":"Raising HDL with CETP inhibitor torcetrapib improves glucose homeostasis in dyslipidemic and insulin resistant hamsters.","abstract":"We investigated whether raising HDL-cholesterol levels with cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition improves glucose homeostasis in dyslipidemic and insulin resistant hamsters. Compared with vehicle, torcetrapib 30 mg/kg/day (TOR) administered for 10 days significantly increased by ?40% both HDL-cholesterol levels and 3H-tracer appearance in HDL after 3H-cholesterol labeled macrophages i.p. injection. TOR significantly reduced fasting plasma triglycerides, glycerol and free fatty acids levels by 65%, 31% and 23%, respectively. TOR also reduced blood glucose levels and plasma insulin by 20% and 49% respectively, which led to a 60% reduction in HOMA-IR index (all p<0.01). After 3H-2-deoxyglucose and insulin injection, TOR significantly increased glucose uptake in oxidative soleus muscle, liver and heart by 26, 33 and 70%, respectively. Raising HDL levels with the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib improves glucose homeostasis in dyslipidemic and insulin resistant hamsters. Whether similar effect would be observed with other CETP inhibitors should be investigated.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530763","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterylester transfer protein","weight":0.889078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterylester_transfer_protein"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Glycerol","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.636032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cholesteryl ester","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteryl_ester"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.349941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Soleus muscle","weight":0.348182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soleus_muscle"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.340536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Free fatty acids","weight":0.284813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fatty_acids"},{"name":"Glucose uptake","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_uptake"},{"name":"Torcetrapib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torcetrapib"},{"name":"Hamster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster"},{"name":"Tritium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"}]}
