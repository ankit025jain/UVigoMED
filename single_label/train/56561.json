{"id":56561,"title":"The word-length effect in reading: a review.","abstract":"The finding that visual processing of a word correlates with the number of its letters has an extensive history. In healthy subjects, a variety of methods, including perceptual thresholds, naming and lexical decision times, and ocular motor parameters, show modest effects that interact with high-order effects like frequency. Whether this indicates serial processing of letters under some conditions or indexes low-level visual factors related to word length is unclear. Word-length effects are larger in pure alexia, where they probably reflect a serial letter-by-letter strategy, due to failure of lexical whole-word processing and variable dysfunction in letter encoding. In pure alexia, the word-length effect is systematically related to mean naming latency, with the word-length effect becoming proportionally greater as naming latency becomes more delayed in severe cases. Other conditions may also generate enhanced word-length effects. This occurs in right hemianopia: Computer simulations suggest a criterion of 160?ms/letter to distinguish hemianopic dyslexia from pure alexia. Normal reading development is accompanied by a decrease in word-length effects, whereas persistently elevated word-length effects are characteristic of developmental dyslexia. Little is known about word-length effects in other reading disorders. We conclude that the word-length effect captures the efficiency of the perceptual reading process in development, normal reading, and a number of reading disorders, even if its mechanistic implications are not always clear.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665973","annotations":[{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.778095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Dyslexia","weight":0.660569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.518382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Word","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word"},{"name":"History","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.239412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lexicon","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Alexia (condition)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexia_(condition)"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Letter (alphabet)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(alphabet)"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"History of Nigeria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Nigeria"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Phoenician alphabet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Information processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing"},{"name":"Lexical decision task","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_decision_task"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Word (computer architecture)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"},{"name":"Hemianopsia","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemianopsia"},{"name":"Pure alexia","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_alexia"}]}
