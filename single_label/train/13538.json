{"id":13538,"title":"Clinical examination protocol to detect atypical and classical scrapie in sheep.","abstract":"The diagnosis of scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSEs) of sheep and goats, is currently based on the detection of disease-associated prion protein by post mortem tests. Unless a random sample of the sheep or goat population is actively monitored for scrapie, identification of scrapie cases relies on the reporting of clinical suspects, which is dependent on the individual's familiarization with the disease and ability to recognize clinical signs associated with scrapie. Scrapie may not be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurological diseases in small ruminants, particularly in countries with low scrapie prevalence, or not recognized if it presents as nonpruritic form like atypical scrapie. To aid in the identification of clinical suspects, a short examination protocol is presented to assess the display of specific clinical signs associated with pruritic and nonpruritic forms of TSEs in sheep, which could also be applied to goats. This includes assessment of behavior, vision (by testing of the menace response), pruritus (by testing the response to scratching), and movement (with and without blindfolding). This may lead to a more detailed neurologic examination of reporting animals as scrapie suspects. It could also be used in experimental TSE studies of sheep or goats to evaluate disease progression or to identify clinical end-point.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473217","annotations":[{"name":"Itch","weight":0.886808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prion","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.540631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.467274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Scrapie","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapie"},{"name":"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_spongiform_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Neurological examination","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_examination"},{"name":"PRNP","weight":0.26675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRNP"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.257647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.239976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.207942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Ruminant","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
