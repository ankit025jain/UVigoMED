{"id":52840,"title":"Epidemiology and treatment outcomes of diabetic retinopathy in a diabetic population from Cameroon.","abstract":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes. It can lead to significant visual loss. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and clinical profile of diabetic retinopathy, and assess the outcomes of laser photocoagulation therapy in a diabetic population in Cameroon.We carried out a prospective cohort study during 24 months in the Department of Ophthalmology of the Douala General Hospital, Cameroon. We included all diabetic patients who were referred from diabetes clinics for ophthalmologic evaluation. Data included type and duration of diabetes, visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure, results of fundoscopy and fluorescein angiography, and outcomes two months after treatment with laser photocoagulation.We included 407 patients; 88% had type 2 diabetes. Their mean duration of diabetes was 6.4 years (SD=6.6). Forty point three percent (164/407) of patients were found to have DR on fundoscopy. Of the 164 patients with DR, 63.4% (104/164) had non-proliferative and 36.6% (60/164) had proliferative DR. Diabetic maculopathy was found in 14.5% (59/407) of all participants, and 36% (59/164) of patients with DR. There was a strong correlation between the duration of diabetes and retinopathy status (p < 0.001, r = 0.9541). Overall, 17.4% (71/407) of patients were eligible for laser photocoagulation. Of these, 66.2% (47/71) were treated, and 78.7% (37/47) of treated patients came back for control two months later. Among these treated patients an improvement of the retinopathy was noted in 73% (27/37), no change in 16.2% (6/37) and a worsening in 10.8% (4/37). Severe proliferative DR was significantly associated with treatment failure (p < 0.001).The frequency of DR may be high among diabetic patients in Cameroon. There was a good uptake of laser photocoagulation therapy among patients affected by DR in our setting, with good treatment outcomes. Interventions to prevent diabetes and increase the precocity of diagnosis and treatment of DR should be scaled up.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564334","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Ophthalmoscopy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmoscopy"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.780709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.680462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.663138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.502592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.302673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.136923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.12281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"}]}
