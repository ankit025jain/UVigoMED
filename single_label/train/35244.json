{"id":35244,"title":"Isolated terminal limb reduction defects: extending the clinical spectrum of Adams-Oliver syndrome and ARHGAP31 mutations.","abstract":"Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS; OMIM 100300) typically comprises a combination of congenital scalp defects and terminal transverse limb defects. Recently, mutations in ARHGAP31 and RBPJ have been found causing autosomal dominant forms of AOS. We describe a four-generation pedigree with isolated terminal limb defects and a truncating mutation in ARHGAP31. This finding underscores the relevance of sequencing ARHGAP31 in similar cases of isolated limb defects, irrespective of the presence of a complete AOS phenotype. We also highlight the variability of clinical features among mutation carriers, ranging from severe reduction defects to mild as well as clinically unaffected cases suggesting reduced penetrance.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668619","annotations":[{"name":"Penetrance","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.819649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Mendelian_Inheritance_in_Man"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.454175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.365466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pedigree chart","weight":0.233735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"RBPJ","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBPJ"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Truncation (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry)"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
