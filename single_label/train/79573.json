{"id":79573,"title":"Three cases of primary hydatidosis of the gluteus muscle: our experience in clinical, diagnostic and treatment aspects.","abstract":"Three cases of primary hydatidosis of the gluteus muscle treated in our department during the last 10 years are described. The first was initially misinterpreted as perineal or sciatic hernia. The diagnosis was set in the operating room. In the second case we included in our differential diagnosis the possibility of parasitic involvement at unusual sites. The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasonography followed by computed tomography (CT) scans in order to rule out liver and pulmonary involvement. The last patient was initially operated elsewhere but finally came to us to treat his complications. At years following surgery there was no evidence of recurrence in any of the patients, but the last one still suffers from recurrent fasciitis and sciatica.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149624","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.810215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sciatica","weight":0.627383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatica"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.585215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.554331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.399803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Sciatic nerve","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Gluteal muscles","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteal_muscles"}]}
