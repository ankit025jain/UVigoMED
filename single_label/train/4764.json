The comparison of anti-measles virus antibodies levels measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) was described. It was found that the 200 mIU/ml of anti-measles activity measured by PRNT (level protection against symp- tomatic disease) is equivalent of 636 mIU/ml measured by EIA (EnzygnostÂ®Anti-Measles Virus/IgG, Simens).","date":"2014-11-14","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25394302","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.785183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.716729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.62,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.603812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.251152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.111848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0695264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"636","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/636"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neutralisation (immunology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralisation_(immunology)"}]}
