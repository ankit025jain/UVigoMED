{"id":61221,"title":"Differences in cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory cell reaction of patients with leptomeningeal involvement by lymphoma and carcinoma.","abstract":"Dissemination of neoplastic cells into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leptomeninges is a devastating complication in patients with epithelial cell neoplasia (leptomeningeal carcinomatosis [LC]) and lymphomas (lymphomatous meningitis [LyM]). Information about the surrounding inflammatory cell populations is scarce. In this study, flow cytometry immunophenotyping was used to describe the distribution of the main leukocyte populations in the CSF of 83 patients diagnosed with neoplastic meningitis (LC, n = 65; LyM, n = 18). These data were compared with those obtained in the CSF from 55 patients diagnosed with the same groups of neoplasia without meningeal involvement (solid tumors, n = 36; high-grade lymphoma, n = 19). Median (interquartile) rates of lymphocytes, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells were 59.7% (range, 35-76.6%), 24% (range, 16-53%), and 1.5% (range, 0-7.6%) in LC, respectively, and 98.5% (range, 70.8-100%), 1.5% (range, 0-29.3%), and 0% in LyM, respectively (P < 0.001). No difference was observed between patients with breast adenocarcinoma (n = 30) and lung adenocarcinoma (n = 21), nor with different rates of malignant CSF involvement. Patients with lymphoma (with or without LyM) had a similar CSF leukocyte distribution, but cancer patients with LC and without LC had a distinctive PMN cell rate (P = 0.002). These data show that CSF samples from patients with LC have a greater number of inflammatory cells and a different leukocyte distribution than seen in the CSF from patients with LyM. Description of PMN cells is a distinctive parameter of patients with LC, compared with the CSF from patients with LyM and patients with cancer but without LC.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746871","annotations":[{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Meninges","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Immunophenotyping","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunophenotyping"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.769836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Carcinosis","weight":0.638424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinosis"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.372431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.327906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Neoplastic meningitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplastic_meningitis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Range (particle radiation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(particle_radiation)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0153226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
