{"id":50725,"title":"[A case of multiple bony pain due to metastatic malignant pheochromocytoma successfully treated with strontium-89].","abstract":"A 50-year-old woman complaining of right flank pain visited our hospital. Computed tomography revealed adrenal gland tumor measuring 10 cm in diameter, and multiple bone and liver metastases. It was diagnosed as a malignant pheochromocytoma by means of endocrinological examination and metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Although 8 courses of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and dacarbazine therapy were performed, the tumor grew larger gradually, and the bony pain progressed and became uncontrollable with oxycodone hydrochloride. After zoredronic acid and strontium-89 were administered, the bony pain reduced, and the opioid usage could be reduced. In accordance with disease progression, the bony pain progressed again, but the readministration of strontium-89 could diminish the pain again. To our knowledge, this is the first case of malignant pheochromocytoma which strontium-89 was administered, and was effective.
