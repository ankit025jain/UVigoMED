{"id":66825,"title":"Cutaneous manifestations in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.","abstract":"Patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) may exhibit various cutaneous abnormalities, including changes in skin colour, pruritus, xerosis, hair, nail and oral changes, metastatic calcinosis, and bullous dermatosis. These changes have a considerable negative effect on the patient's quality of life. Early recognition of cutaneous signs and prompt initiation of treatment can dramatically alter their course and decrease morbidity.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674672","annotations":[{"name":"Itch","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.764704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.584428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.572859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Human skin color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Xerosis cutis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerosis_cutis"},{"name":"Calcinosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcinosis"},{"name":"Corticotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
