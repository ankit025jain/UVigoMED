{"id":61870,"title":"Glutathione S-transferase gene polymorphisms and susceptibility  to chronic myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"Glutathione S-transferase (GST), a phase II metabolizing enzyme, plays an important role in the cellar defense system, and its activity may modulate leukemia risk. A large body of evidence has shown the possible relevance of functional polymorphisms of the genes that encode GSTs ?, ?, and ? (GSTM1, GSTP1, and GST1, respectively) to the genetic susceptibility of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Because of the lack of available conclusive data, we performed a meta-analysis of all relevant available studies to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed and Web of Knowledge electronic databases was conducted to collect relevant studies until December 20, 2013, and the extracted data were statistically analyzed using Review Manager version 5.2. Finally, 16 eligible studies were identified in the literature. The GSTT1 null genotype was associated with an increased risk of CML, as were the double null GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes. These findings suggest that heritable GST status influences the risk of developing CML and that more attention should be paid to carriers of these susceptibility genes.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
