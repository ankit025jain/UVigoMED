{"id":87428,"title":"Evaluation of the outcome of replacement hemiarthroplasty by uncemented bipolar prosthesis in displaced fracture neck femur.","abstract":"Despite continued discussion regarding the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures, controversies continue regarding their optimal treatment, including the choice of implant and fixation method. Hemiarthroplasty is one of the option which eliminate concerns about fixation failure, nonunion, and avascular necrosis and has become the choice of surgery among the aged >60. This prospective interventional study was carried out on 28 cases at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), from July 2009 to April 2012 to evaluate cementless, bipolar prosthesis among the active elderly patients. All subjects were evaluated with regard to postoperative clinical, functional and activity outcome (Modified Harris Hip Scoring and Hip Outcome Scoring), intra and post operative complications. One case was dropped from follow up and 22(81.48%) patients were considered to have satisfactory outcome after statistical analysis by chi-square test on at least 12 months follow up records. Although prosthetic stem valgus and periprosthetic fracture developed in 02 cases and 01 patient had sunken prosthesis, uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty can give significantly good functional outcomes with minimal complications for displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture in active elderly patients.
