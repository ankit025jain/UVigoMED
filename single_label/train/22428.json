{"id":22428,"title":"Comparative proteomic label-free analysis of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 cultured with porcine mucin.","abstract":"Campylobacter jejuni is a major gastrointestinal pathogen in humans. Poultry is a primary reservoir for C. jejuni, and C. jejuni appears to be highly adapted to the gastrointestinal tracts of avian species. We determined the protein expression profiles of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 cultured in medium containing porcine mucin. Differentially expressed proteins in the presence and absence of porcine mucin were identified using the label-free method. We identified 52 proteins with expression that was either upregulated (32 proteins) or downregulated (20 proteins) by porcine mucin. These proteins are involved in diverse cellular functions, such as motility, cell wall synthesis, iron transport, energy production, and amino acid metabolism. In particular, the upregulated proteins were involved in chemotaxis (CheV and CetA), motility (FlaA), colonization and adherence (CadF, FrdA, CfrA, MapA, and HydA), and stress tolerance (TrxB and ClpB). These results suggest that C. jejuni changes its protein expression in response to porcine mucin and that this change in expression may contribute to host adaptation of C. jejuni NCTC 11168.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552179","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Campylobacter","weight":0.851375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.819178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell wall","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.687218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.663739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.449045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.448417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Campylobacter jejuni","weight":0.446754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter_jejuni"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.403008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.379206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.32901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Energy development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
