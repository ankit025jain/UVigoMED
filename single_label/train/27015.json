{"id":27015,"title":"Designing effective drug and device development programs for hospitalized heart failure: a proposal for pretrial registries.","abstract":"Recent international phase III clinical trials of novel therapies for hospitalized heart failure (HHF) have failed to improve the unacceptably high postdischarge event rate. These large studies have demonstrated notable geographic and site-specific variation in patient profiles and enrollment. Possible contributors to the lack of success in HHF outcome trials include challenges in selecting clinical sites capable of (1) providing adequate numbers of appropriately selected patients and (2) properly executing the study protocol. We propose a \"pretrial registry\" as a novel tool for improving the efficiency and quality of international HHF trials by focusing on the selection and cultivation of high-quality sites. A pretrial registry may help assess a site's ability to achieve adequate enrollment of the target patient population, integrate protocol requirements into clinical workflow, and accomplish appropriate follow-up. Although such a process would be associated with additional upfront resource investment, this appropriation may be modest in comparison with the downstream costs associated with maintenance of poorly performing sites, failed clinical trials, and the global health and economic burden of HHF. This review is based on discussions between scientists, clinical trialists, and regulatory representatives regarding methods for improving international HHF trials that took place at the United States Food and Drug Administration on January 12th, 2012.
