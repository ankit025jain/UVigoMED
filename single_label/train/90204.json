{"id":90204,"title":"[Surgical repair of chronic tears of the second plantar plate].","abstract":"To explore the operative methods and the short-term effectiveness to repair chronic tears of the 2nd plantar plate.Between June 2012 and June 2013, 14 patients with chronic tears of the 2nd plantar plate were treated. There were 4 males and 10 females with an average age of 65.9 years (range, 51-82 years) and with an average disease duration of 6.2 years (range, 5-9 years). The left side was involved in 5 cases and the right side in 9 cases. One patient had simple hammer toe; 2 patients had hallux valgus and claw toe; and 11 patients had hallux valgus and hammer toes. All of them had unstable the 2nd metatarsophalangeal joints. The results of modified Lachman test and drawer test were positive. The surgical treatment included a Weil osteotomy and plantar plate repair operation for rupture via dorsal incision after correcting hallux valgus.Primary healing of incision was obtained in all patients. Twelve patients were followed up 6-12 months (mean, 8.2 months). Hallux valgus, claw toe, and hammer toe were all corrected. The results of modified Lachman test and drawer test were negative at 3 months after operation. Mild pain of the 2nd metatarsophalangeal joint occurred, but no stiff was observed in 2 cases at 6 months after operation. The midfoot and forefoot score of American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) was 90.50 +/- 3.73 at last follow-up, which was significantly higher (t=21.724, P=0.000) than preoperative score (57.33 +/- 4.99).The plantar plate is the key to maintain the stability of the metatarsophalangeal joints, and surgical repair can achieve good short-term effectiveness in treating chronic tears of the 2nd plantar plate.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640362","annotations":[{"name":"Bunion","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunion"},{"name":"Hallux","weight":0.907207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallux"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.844802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Metatarsophalangeal articulations","weight":0.64303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsophalangeal_articulations"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.629182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.39426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hammer toe","weight":0.376208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_toe"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Plantar","weight":0.0736257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar"},{"name":"Hammer","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Lachman test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachman_test"},{"name":"Claw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
