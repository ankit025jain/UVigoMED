{"id":39143,"title":"[Preoperative portal vein embolization: dynamics of portal pressure].","abstract":"The pressure dynamics was studied in a portal vein (PV) in patients, suffering focal hepatic pathology, to whom portal vein embolization (PVE) was performed as a stage of preparation to radical hepatic resection. In 236 patients the immediate measurement of pressure in a PV was performed intraoperatively before and after PVE, in 26 - catheter for control portography and monitoring of pressure in a PV was left in its trunk for 24 h postoperatively. There was noted a pressure rising in a PV immediately after its embolization by 86.7%, positive correlation was established between PVE volume and pressure gradient in a PV before and after it. While doing monitoring during 24 h there was observed the pressure rising in a PV during 3 h after its embolization with subsequent lowering down to initial. Application of PVE as a preparation procedure for performance of extended hepatic resection, together with enhancement of residual liver minimizes sharp postresectional pressure rising in PV, what constitutes essential factor of the hepatocytes damage of residual hepatic part in immediate postoperative period.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252551","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.564358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.495466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.355578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.345146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.103779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Player versus environment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_environment"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"}]}
