{"id":77294,"title":"[Study on current status of work-related musculoskeletal disorders evaluation].","abstract":"To characterize the distribution of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMD) among the occupational population.A total of 1686 people of various occupations were recruited with random cluster sampling. Standardized Nordic questionnaires for the analysis of musculoskeletal systems were used to evaluate WRMD at the neck, shoulder, or lower back in the past one year. The annual prevalence of WRMD was determined. Difference analysis was performed with t-test, ANOVA, or chi-square test. The relationship between personal characteristics and WRMD was analyzed by unconditional logistic regression.(1) WRMD were most frequently observed at the neck, followed by the lower back, and was least observed at the shoulder (P < 0.05). The prevalence of WRMD among mental workers was significantly higher than those among physical workers and mental-physical workers (P < 0.01). The prevalence of WRMD among female workers was significantly higher than that among male workers (P < 0.05). (2) In general, the prevalence of WRMD significantly rose with the increases in age (<30, 30?, 40?, and ? 50 years) or working years (<10, 10?, and ? 20 years) (P < 0.05). (3) In the face of sickness or injury, physical workers and mental workers showed a relatively high absence rate but a relatively low medical visiting rate (13.05%). (4) Unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that mental work, gender, and working year were the main influential factors for WRMD among workers.Workers of different types of occupation, genders, ages, and working years have different risks of WRMD at the neck, shoulder, and lower back.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25182993","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.834603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.709789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.656727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.484048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.248241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Cluster sampling","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"1686","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1686"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Nordic countries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
