{"id":1018,"title":"Facilitating anticoagulation for safer transitions: preliminary outcomes from an emergency department deep vein thrombosis discharge program.","abstract":"Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an acute uncomplicated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may be eligible for outpatient treatment. This study aims to establish a transition of care program in the ED for patients with DVT presenting with an acute uncomplicated DVT.This article specifies the transition of care program for DVT patients in the ED. Data was collected on patients admitted and discharged from the ED who had an acute DVT both prior to the initiation of facilitating anticoagulation for safer transitions (FAST) and after initiation of FAST. Follow-up phone calls were made to patients discharged from the ED after the initiation of FAST, and data were collected on follow-up appointments, anticoagulation adherence, readmission rates, and patient satisfaction.The FAST program has been successfully implemented. By the 30-day follow-up phone call, 100% of patients had attended a follow-up appointment. The average time to the follow-up appointment post-discharge was 4.4 days (range, 1-7 days). None of the patients at the 3- to 5-day follow-up phone call and 30-day phone call had any issues taking their anticoagulant, and none reported side effects of significant bleeding. One patient was re-admitted after discharge with a pulmonary embolism. Patient satisfaction has also been very high with the program, with all patients indicating at the 30-day phone call that they would recommend the program to a friend or family member. The educational components of this program also improved the discharge process for this population compared with patients discharged prior to the initiation of FAST.The FAST program is an example of a successful transition-of-care program for discharging DVT patients from the ED. Reassessment and improvements to the program are underway to ensure it remains current, sustainable, and provider friendly.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25502127","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.812508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.752412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.737187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.718209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.531667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.330914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Outpatient commitment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_commitment"},{"name":"Telephone call","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_call"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Exhibition game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
