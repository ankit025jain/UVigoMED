{"id":56847,"title":"Outcome of \"mushroom\" pattern femtosecond laser-assisted keratoplasty versus conventional penetrating keratoplasty in patients with keratoconus.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of \"mushroom\" femtosecond laser-enabled keratoplasty (M-FLEK) with those of conventional penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) in eyes with keratoconus. The femtosecond laser-enabled \"mushroom\" pattern keratoplasty technique results in less postoperative astigmatism and higher endothelial cell counts compared with conventional PKP in patients with keratoconus.This was a nonrandomized retrospective, single private center clinical study. Between March 2010 and April 2012, 26 eyes underwent M-FLEK and 33 eyes underwent conventional PKP. Data on preoperative and postoperative manifest refraction, uncorrected visual acuity and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), endothelial cell counts, vector analysis, and complications were retrieved and analyzed.At 12 months of follow-up, the mean logMAR BCVA was 0.31 ± 0.55 in the M-FLEK group and 0.32 ± 0.21 in the PKP group (P = 0.91). The mean spherical equivalent was similar between the groups. The mean manifest cylinder was significantly lower in the M-FLEK group (-2.84 ± 1.08 diopters) than in the PKP group (-3.93 ± 2.26 diopters; P = 0.03). There was a smaller mean endothelial cell loss in the M-FLEK group compared with the PKP group (32.1% vs 38.7%, respectively, P = 0.17) 1 year postoperatively. The complication rates were similar for both groups.M-FLEK appears to be a safe procedure that results in less astigmatism and a trend toward higher endothelial cell counts compared with conventional PKP, with similar postoperative BCVA.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619167","annotations":[{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.684279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Astigmatism (eye)","weight":0.629108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(eye)"},{"name":"Corneal endothelium","weight":0.611663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_endothelium"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.552823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.426517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.307782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.157157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Mushroom","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom"},{"name":"Vector calculus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Euclidean vector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Polish State Railways","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_State_Railways"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
