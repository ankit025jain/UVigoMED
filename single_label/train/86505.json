{"id":86505,"title":"Lung cancer stigma predicts timing of medical help-seeking behavior.","abstract":"To examine relationships among demographic variables, healthcare system distrust, lung cancer stigma, smoking status, and timing of medical help-seeking behavior in individuals with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer after controlling for ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and social desirability.Descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational study.Outpatient oncology clinics in Louisville, KY.94 patients diagnosed in the past three weeks to six years with all stages of lung cancer.Self-report, written survey packets were administered in person followed by a semistructured interview to assess symptoms and timing characteristics of practice-identified patients with lung cancer.Timing of medical help-seeking behavior, healthcare system distrust, lung cancer stigma, and smoking status.Lung cancer stigma was independently associated with timing of medical help-seeking behavior in patients with lung cancer. Healthcare system distrust and smoking status were not independently associated with timing of medical help-seeking behavior.FINDINGS suggest that stigma influences medical help-seeking behavior for lung cancer symptoms, serving as a barrier to prompt medical help-seeking behavior.When designing interventions to promote early medical help-seeking behavior in individuals with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer, methods that consider lung cancer stigma as a barrier that can be addressed through public awareness and patient-targeted interventions should be included.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769603","annotations":[{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.822519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.692776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.636741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.559226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Louisville, Kentucky","weight":0.378899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.323585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.261748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.259797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.227797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Kentucky","weight":0.078616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Roller coaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.0162824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Network packet","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet"},{"name":"Social desirability bias","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias"}]}
