{"id":69052,"title":"Farnesoid X receptor ligand prevents cisplatin-induced kidney injury by enhancing small heterodimer partner.","abstract":"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is mainly expressed in liver, intestine and kidney. We investigated whether 6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid (6ECDCA), a semisynthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic aicd (CDCA, an FXR ligand), protects against kidney injury and modulates small heterodimer partner (SHP) in cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Cisplatin inhibited SHP protein expression in the kidney of cisplatin-treated mice and human proximal tubular (HK2) cells; this effect was counteracted by FXR ligand. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the presence of tubular casts, obstructions and dilatations in cisplatin-induced kidney injury, which was attenuated by FXR ligand. FXR ligand also attenuated protein expression of transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1), Smad signaling, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process, inflammatory markers and cytokines, and apoptotic markers in cisplatin-treated mice. Cisplatin induced NF-?B activation in HK2 cell; this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with FXR ligand. In SHP knockdown by small interfering RNA, cisplatin-induced activation of TGF-?1, p-JNK and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was not attenuated, while SHP overexpression and FXR ligand inhibited expression of these proteins in cisplatin-pretreated HK2 cells. In conclusion, FXR ligand, 6ECDCA prevents cisplatin-induced kidney injury, the underlying mechanism of which may be associated with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects through SHP induction.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475141","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering
