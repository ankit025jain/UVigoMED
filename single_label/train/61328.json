{"id":61328,"title":"Severe neutropenia in dengue patients: prevalence and significance.","abstract":"Studies on severe neutropenia in dengue are scarce, and its clinical significance is uncertain. We analyzed a cohort of 1,921 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed adult dengue patients admitted to the Communicable Disease Center in Singapore between 2005 and 2008. Time trend analyses for daily absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were done using Bayesian hierarchical and Markov models. We found that severe neutropenia, defined as ANC ? 0.5 Ã— 10(9)/L, was found in 11.8% with a median duration of 1 day. ANC nadir occurred on illness day 5. Severe neutropenia was not predictive of more severe disease and not associated with secondary bacterial infections, prolonged hospital stay, prolonged fever, or fatal outcome. We concluded that prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated in patients with severe neutropenia without indication for bacterial infection.
