{"id":65433,"title":"Safety and six-month durability of angioplasty for isolated penile artery stenoses in patients with erectile dysfunction: a first-in-man study.","abstract":"Obstructive pelvic arterial lesions are highly prevalent in patients with erectile dysfunction and commonly located in penile artery segments. In this first-in-man study, we intended to assess the safety and feasibility of balloon angioplasty for isolated penile artery stenoses in patients with erectile dysfunction.Twenty-five patients with erectile dysfunction and isolated penile artery stenoses (unilateral stenosis ?70% or bilateral stenoses ?50%) identified by pelvic computed tomographic angiography were enrolled. A total of 20 patients (mean age 61 years [range, 48-79 years]) underwent balloon angioplasty. Three patients had bilateral penile artery stenoses. Procedural success was achieved in all 23 penile arteries, with an average balloon size of 1.6 mm (range, 1.00-2.25 mm). The average International Index for Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score improved from 10.0±5.2 at baseline to 15.2±6.7 (p<0.001) at one month and 15.2±6.3 (p<0.001) at six months. Clinical success (change in the IIEF-5 score ?4 or normalisation of erectile function [IIEF-5 ?22]) was achieved in 15 (75%), 13 (65%), and 12 (60%) patients at one, three, and six months, respectively. There were no adverse events through follow-up.For the first time we demonstrated that penile artery angioplasty is safe and can achieve clinically significant improvement in erectile function in 60% of patients with erectile dysfunction and isolated penile artery stenoses.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832642","annotations":[{"name":"Artery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.619889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.571231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.521576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.445037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.301989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.254924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Sexological testing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexological_testing"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"25 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_mm_caliber"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"}]}
