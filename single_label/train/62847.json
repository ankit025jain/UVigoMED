{"id":62847,"title":"Gestational iron deficiency and the related anaemia in northern zone of Ebonyi State.","abstract":"Iron is one instrumental micronutrient to any healthy pregnancy. Its deficiency (with or without overt anaemia) remains a significant risk factor to gestational complications. In the present study, 307 pregnant women were prospectively recruited from Northern zone of Ebonyi State to assess their gestational iron status. The iron status of the subjects was determined with serum iron level and heamoglobin concentration, using atomic absorption (flame) spectrometric and Drabkin's methods respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using the computer software: \"Statistical Program for Social Sciences\" (SPSS for windows version 15.0). The result showed that 177 (59.8%) of the pregnant women were iron deficient, while 45.6% of them was at the risk of iron deficiency anaemia. Parity, educational level, occupation and living accommodation showed significant (p < 0.05) influence on the iron status of the subjects. It could be concluded that gestational iron deficiency with its related anaemia was yet to be effectively brought under control in our society; with parity and economic status implicated as risk factors.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506016","annotations":[{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.744206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.56142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.552971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.276491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.252868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.238585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Iron deficiency anemia","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_anemia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Ebonyi State","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonyi_State"},{"name":"Serum iron","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_iron"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Atomic absorption spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Fire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire"},{"name":"Hotel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel"},{"name":"Parity (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"}]}
