{"id":51597,"title":"Accuracy of capillary blood 3-?-hydroxybutyrate determination for the detection and treatment of canine diabetic ketoacidosis.","abstract":"In human medicine, diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is usually based on measurement of capillary 3-?-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) with a hand held ketone sensor. This study was conducted to determine if measurement of capillary 3-HB could be useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of canine DKA. Fifteen dogs with diabetic ketosis and 10 with DKA were evaluated. Paired measurements of 3-HB of capillary and venous blood samples were analysed by the electrochemical sensor and reference method. Use of capillary 3-HB measurement during DKA management was then evaluated through simultaneous measurements of capillary 3-HB, urinary AcAc and venous blood gas analysis. Good agreement between capillary and venous 3-HB measurement was detected by the electrochemical sensor and reference method. Monitoring treatment of DKA revealed a significant correlation between capillary 3-HB and acidosis markers, while no significant correlation was observed between AcAc and acidosis markers. A cut-off value of capillary blood 3-HB > 3.8 mmol/L for diagnosis of DKA resulted in 70% and 92% sensitivity and specificity. The electrochemical sensor accurately measures 3-HB concentration in both capillary and venous blood samples, is accurate in diagnosing canine DKA, and appears to reflect the patient's metabolic status during DKA treatment.
