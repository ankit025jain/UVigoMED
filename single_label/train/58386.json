{"id":58386,"title":"Efficacy and safety of intrauterine insemination and assisted reproductive technology in populations serodiscordant for human immunodeficiency virus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"To assess procreative outcomes for HIV-positive men and women with seronegative partners.Systematic review and meta-analysis.Not applicable.Twenty-four studies with extractable data for HIV-serodiscordant couples undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) or inÂ vitro fertilization (IVF).None.HIV transmission to a seronegative partner and per cycle fecundability; secondary outcomes: analysis of multiple gestation rates, miscarriage rates, and cancellation rates.For serodiscordant couples, HIV-positive men or women undergoing IUI and IVF treatment had a 17%, 30%, 14%, and 16% per cycle fecundability, respectively. Multiple gestation rates were 10%, 33%, 14%, and 29%, respectively. Miscarriage rates were 19%, 25%, 13%, and 20%, respectively. No HIV transmission was observed in 8,212 IUI and 1,254 IVF cycles, resulting in 95% confidence that the true rate is 4.5 transmissions per 10,000 IUI cycles or less.In serodiscordant couples, IUI and IVF seem effective and safe based on the literature. Evidence-based practice and social justice suggest that our field should increase access to care for HIV-serodiscordant couples.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951364","annotations":[{"name":"Artificial insemination","weight":0.879203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.864161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Fecundity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecundity"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.742918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Insemination","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insemination"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.707482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.402543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Domestic partnership","weight":0.148115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Social justice","weight":0.0575759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice"},{"name":"Serodiscordant","weight":0.0524275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serodiscordant"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Justice","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
