{"id":52636,"title":"GLP-1-based strategies: a physiological analysis of differential mode of action.","abstract":"DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists used in incretin-based strategies treat Type 2 diabetes with different modes of action. The pharmacological blood GLP-1R agonist concentration targets pancreatic and some extrapancreatic GLP-1R, whereas DPP4i favors the physiological activation of the gut-brain-periphery axis that could allow clinicians to adapt the management of Type 2 diabetes, according to the patient's pathophysiological characteristics.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583767","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.498463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.317819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide_1_receptor"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitor"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Democratic Progressive Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Differential signaling","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signaling"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
