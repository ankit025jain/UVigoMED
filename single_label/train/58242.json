{"id":58242,"title":"A randomized controlled trial on early induction compared to expectant management of nulliparous women with prolonged latent phases.","abstract":"To compare early induction and expectant management regarding delivery outcomes and the experience of delivery in nulliparous women with prolonged latent phases.Randomized controlled trial.One delivery unit in a Swedish hospital.Nulliparous women at term experiencing continuous contractions impeding rest (women's report) and exceeding 18 h, a cervical dilation of less than 4 cm, intact membranes and with a singleton fetus in cephalic presentation.The women were randomly allocated to either early induction (n = 65) or expectant management (n = 64). All participants received medication for therapeutic rest. The early induction group was induced five hours after medication, and the expectant group awaited spontaneous onset of labor. The Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ version B) was filled in after delivery.The primary outcome was mode of delivery. Secondary outcomes included birth experience, duration of labor, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal outcomes.The cesarean section rate was 15 of 65 (23.1%) in the early induction group and 24 of 64 (37.5%) in the expectant group (p = 0.076, OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.93-4.31). No significant differences were shown regarding delivery, neonatal outcomes or birth experience.No significant differences were shown between the two groups in the rate of cesarean sections or the experience of delivery. According to the actual results, the power to detect a difference was only 45%. The cesarean section rate was high in both groups, regardless of intervention.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974855","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.848405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Postpartum hemorrhage","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Cervical dilation","weight":0.772293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_dilation"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.769902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Uterine contraction","weight":0.715388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_contraction"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.420466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Head","weight":0.153788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Cephalic presentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalic_presentation"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Presentation (obstetrics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_(obstetrics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
