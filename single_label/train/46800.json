{"id":46800,"title":"Well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma with invasive foci.","abstract":"Well-differentiated papillary mesotheliomas (WDPMs) are usually encountered as incidental findings in the peritoneal cavity in women. Most WDPMs are benign, and the histologic features that indicate a more aggressive course are controversial. We report 20 cases of WDPM, which contained invasive foci. Thirteen cases arose in the peritoneal cavity, 1 in a hernia sac, 3 in the pleural cavity, and 3 in hydroceles. The female:male ratio was 16:4, and age range was 7 to 74 years. Tumor was multifocal in 15 cases. Some tumors showed back-to-back papillae, a pattern mimicking invasion but discernible on pan-keratin stain as compressive crowding. True invasive patterns ranged from simple bland-appearing glands invading the stalks of the papillae to solid foci of invasive tumor of higher cytologic grade than the original WDPM. All 5 tested cases were negative for p16 deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization, but 2/3 had abnormal karyotypes. Recurrences were seen in 8 patients, and in 4 multiple recurrences were documented. Of 16 patients with follow-up, 14 are alive from periods of 6 months to 6 years (average 3.5 y), and 2 have known recurrent disease. One patient died of disseminated tumor at 8 years but without histologic confirmation of the nature of the tumor. We conclude that WDPM with invasive foci in the papillae appear to be prone to multifocality and recurrence, but that they rarely give rise to life-threatening disease. We suggest that these lesions be called WDPM with invasive foci to alert clinicians to the possibility of recurrence.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618613","annotations":[{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Peritoneal cavity","weight":0.638202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_cavity"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.636332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Mesothelioma","weight":0.578049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.529067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.479283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.450309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Cytopathology","weight":0.419549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopathology"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.335355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.149266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Nipple","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple"},{"name":"Incidentaloma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidentaloma"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"}]}
