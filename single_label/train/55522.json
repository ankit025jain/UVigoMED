{"id":55522,"title":"[Application fluorescein angiography: a new method for assessment of anterior eye segment hemomicrocirculation].","abstract":"To develop a noninvasive fluorescein angiography (FAG) method for the anterior eye segment (AES) assessment which would imply using the most-ordered site of bulbar conjunctival capillary bed as the object of dye administration.The study enrolled 30 individuals (41 eyes) with no evident ocular pathology and significant systemic diseases aged from 18 to 70 years and 19 patients with uveitis, of whom 10 patients (10 eyes) aged 43-57 had anterior uveitis and 9 patients (10 eyes) aged 17-29 had pars planitis. Assessment of conjunctival microcirculation was done by the proposed method of fluorescein angiography in which the dye is applied to the bulbar conjunctival capillary bed.In all cases after a microdose of fluorescein was administered to the intermediate zone capillaries it distributed into two venous systems of the AES: peripheral and prelimbal venules. Circulation time and vascular permeability (depending on the presence or absence of extravasal hyperfluorescence) were described. Angiographic patterns in healthy individuals and patients with either clinical form of uveitis appeared to differ considerably.Findings of the proposed noninvasive application FAG reflect the state of capillary and venular components of bulbar conjunctival microcirculatory system. Sings of increased hemoperfusion of the AES and vascular permeability were seen in patients with acute anterior uveitis, whereas in pars planitis patients vascular hyperpermeability was associated with decreased hemoperfusion of the AES. The proposed method can be used for monitoring of the inflammatory process in anterior and peripheral uveitis.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864494","annotations":[{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.92266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.886812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.832728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.748529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.592099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.561076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.490105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Vascular permeability","weight":0.404537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_permeability"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Venule","weight":0.149224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venule"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0642264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Advanced Encryption Standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"},{"name":"Intermediate uveitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_uveitis"},{"name":"Hemoperfusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoperfusion"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"1729","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Corticobulbar tract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticobulbar_tract"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
