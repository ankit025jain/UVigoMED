{"id":87807,"title":"Percutaneous and minimally invasive Achilles tendon repair - review of surgical techniques.","abstract":"This article presents advantages and disadvantages associated with percutaneous, noninvasive repair of Achilles tendon rupture. We presented most widely known procedures, such as Ma/Griffith, Web/Banister, McCleland/Maffulli, Carmont and Assal Achillon suture system, as well as several other less known surgical techniques. We performed a review of literature with regard to possible complications, including sural nerve damage, possibilities of broadening those techniques to include arthroscopic as well as ultrasound imaging, and proposed a scheme of patient management after surgery.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984160","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.788923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.741578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.659065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.616901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.579542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.486854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Achilles tendon rupture","weight":0.190579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon_rupture"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"}]}
