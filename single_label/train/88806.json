{"id":88806,"title":"Medial opening wedge distal femoral osteotomy for post-traumatic secondary knee osteoarthritis.","abstract":"Osteoarthritis of the knee secondary to femoral fracture is difficult to treat. There are some surgical options, such as total knee arthroplasty or correction osteotomy. Opening wedge high tibial osteotomy is an established treatment of gonarthrosis. However, few reports are available on the effectiveness of a medial opening wedge distal femoral osteotomy. We present a case of a medial opening wedge distal femoral osteotomy on gonarthrosis secondary to a malunited femoral fracture with varus deformity and leg length discrepancy. This osteotomy was performed at the deformed femur, with locking plate fixation and autologous bone graft. Six months after the surgery, the osteotomy site was filled with bridging callus. Two years later, the Knee Society Score improved from 45 to 90 points. Medial opening wedge distal femoral osteotomy can be a useful method to treat knee osteoarthritis associated with distal femoral deformity.
