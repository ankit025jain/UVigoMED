{"id":37177,"title":"The efficacy of the in-house light-emitting diode phototherapy equipment compare to conventional phototherapy equipment on the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.","abstract":"From the empirical study, light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy is effective for treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. However commercial LED phototherapy equipment is still expensive. Thus, in-house LED phototherapy equipment has been developed.To compare efficacy between in-house LED to conventional phototherapy equipment in the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia at Mae Sot Hospital.This was a randomized controlled trial. Fifty newborns with hyperbilirubinemia were allocated to LED phototherapy group and conventional group. Baseline characteristics were compared and analyzed by descriptive statistics, exact probability and student t-test, and change in serum bilirubin level was analyzed by multilevel regression analysis.There were 25 patients in each of the two groups. The median duration of phototherapy in LED group was 25 hours, whereas the conventional group required 48 hours (p < 0.001) and the average serum bilirubin level in LED group decreased more rapidly than in conventional group (p = 0.007). Hyperthermia were found in 22 infants from conventional group (88%) compared to 11 infants from LED group (44%) (p = 0.002).In-house LED phototherapy equipment is more effective than conventional phototherapy in the reduction of serum bilirubin level and occurrence of hyperthermia during treatment is less.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511717","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.886823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.523919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.387715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.15609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.116595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Empirical research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research"},{"name":"Diode","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode"},{"name":"Hyperbilirubinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbilirubinemia"},{"name":"Mae Sot District","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Sot_District"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Mae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"}]}
