{"id":1076,"title":"[Carnitine as a marker of atherosclerosis and other risks of cardiovascular diseases].","abstract":"L-carnitine was first isolated from the extracts of muscle tissue in 1905 by the employees of the department of medicinal chemistry at Moscow University. Later the role of L-carnitine in both the oxidation of long chain fatty acids and the metabolism of carbohydrates was discovered. Today L-carnitine is not just a drug for the treatment of pathologies associated with its deficiency, but also a widespread dietary supplement, believed to be able to reduce weight and improve the physical qualities of a person. However, in light of the recent findings about a possible link between L-carnitine and the development of atherosclerosis, a careful assessment of the use of L-carnitine as a safe dietary supplement is required, particularly when there is no sound medical indication.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464617","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Medicinal chemistry","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicinal_chemistry"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.528692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Carnitine","weight":0.39111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnitine"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.360654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Moscow State University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"}]}
