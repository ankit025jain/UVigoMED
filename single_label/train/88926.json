{"id":88926,"title":"Weekly teriparatide administration for the treatment of delayed union: a report of two cases.","abstract":"Two cases of delayed union that were effectively treated with weekly TPTD administration are described. The effect of this therapy was observed within 4 weeks.In the first case, a 72-year-old woman underwent osteotomy for the treatment of hallux valgus. Bone union was still not observed 4 months after surgery. Therefore, weekly teriparatide (56.5 mg) injections were administered, resulting in the initiation of bone union within 4 weeks and complete bone union 4 months after the first teriparatide injection. In the second case, a 72-year-old woman underwent open reduction and internal fixation of an olecranon fracture. Bone union was delayed 4 months after surgery; therefore, weekly teriparatide (56.5 mg) injections were started.The initiation of bone union was slightly evident within 4 weeks, and complete healing was achieved 4 months after the first teriparatide injection. In both cases, no serious teriparatide-related adverse effects were observed.Weekly teriparatide administration was effective for bone healing and useful for delayed union; moreover, the effect of this therapy showed within 4 weeks.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777526","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Olecranon","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olecranon"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.311687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.141167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Bunion","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunion"},{"name":"Hallux","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallux"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Teriparatide","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriparatide"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"}]}
