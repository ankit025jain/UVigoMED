{"id":36467,"title":"Is melatonin ready to be used in preterm infants as a neuroprotectant?","abstract":"The prevention of neurological disabilities following preterm birth remains a major public health challenge and efforts are still needed to test the neuroprotective properties of candidate molecules. Melatonin serves as a neuroprotectant in adult models of cerebral ischemia through its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. An increasing number of preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that melatonin protects the damaged developing brain by preventing abnormal myelination and an inflammatory glial reaction, a major cause of white matter injury. The main questions asked in this review are whether preclinical data on the neuroprotective properties of melatonin are sufficient to translate this concept into the clinical setting, and whether melatonin can reduce white matter damage in preterm infants. This review provides support for our view that melatonin is now ready to be tested in human preterm neonates, and discusses ongoing and planned clinical trials.
