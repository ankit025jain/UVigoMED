{"id":47228,"title":"MDCT of retractor-related hepatic injury following laparoscopic surgery: appearances, incidence, and follow-up.","abstract":"To investigate the postoperative computed tomography (CT) features resulting from the use of Nathanson retractors during laparoscopic upper gastro-intestinal surgery.A 3-year retrospective study of 176 patients who had undergone laparoscopic upper gastro-intestinal surgery for bariatric or malignant disease was performed. Postoperative CT images [divided into early (? 30 days) and late (>30 days)] were assessed by a consultant radiologist and liver abnormalities recorded.The features of a retractor injury were a hypodense lesion, abutting the liver edge, usually triangular or linear in shape. Late postoperative features included focal subcapsular retraction and associated liver atrophy. Sixty-eight percent (52/77) of patients undergoing surgery for malignancy underwent postoperative CT, compared with 11% (11/99) of those undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients with malignancy were more likely to have retraction-related liver abnormalities (14/52, 27%) at postoperative CT than those in the bariatric group (2/11, 18%).Retractor-related liver injuries at MDCT are common following laparoscopic upper gastro-intestinal surgery. Recognition of the characteristic triad of features, a hypodense lesion abutting the liver edge with a triangular or linear shape, should allow confident diagnosis. CT follow-up reveals that over time these lesions may disappear, remain unchanged, or result in a focal subcapsular scar with associated atrophy.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598215","annotations":[{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.802204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.31123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.301224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.22,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Digestive system surgery","weight":0.126617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_system_surgery"},{"name":"General surgery","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_surgery"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Consultant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)"}]}
