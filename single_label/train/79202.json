{"id":79202,"title":"Music mixing preferences of cochlear implant recipients: a pilot study.","abstract":"Music perception and appraisal are generally poor in cochlear implant recipients. Simple musical structures, lyrics that are easy to follow, and clear rhythm/beat have been reported among the top factors to enhance music enjoyment. The present study investigated the preference for modified relative instrument levels in music with normal-hearing and cochlear implant subjects.In experiment 1, test subjects were given a mixing console and multi-track recordings to determine their most enjoyable audio mix. In experiment 2, a preference rating experiment based on the preferred relative level settings in experiment 1 was performed.Experiment 1 was performed with four postlingually deafened cochlear implant subjects, experiment 2 with ten normal-hearing and ten cochlear implant subjects.A significant difference in preference rating was found between normal-hearing and cochlear implant subjects. The latter preferred an audio mix with larger vocals-to-instruments ratio. In addition, given an audio mix with clear vocals and attenuated instruments, cochlear implant subjects preferred the bass/drum track to be louder than the other instrument tracks.The original audio mix in real-world music might not be suitable for cochlear implant recipients. Modifying the relative instrument level settings potentially improves music enjoyment.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471410","annotations":[{"name":"Mixing console","weight":0.838973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.731015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Music","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"},{"name":"Lyrics","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrics"},{"name":"Bass drum","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_drum"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.276604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Musical theatre","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre"},{"name":"Singing","weight":0.243561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.150894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Multitrack recording","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrack_recording"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.0545625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Video game console","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Human subject research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_subject_research"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Real estate appraisal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Relative poverty","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_poverty"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Entertainment","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment"}]}
