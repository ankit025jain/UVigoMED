{"id":51001,"title":"Heterogeneity of cardiovascular risk factors profile in non-diabetic women 2-24 months post gestational diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Previously gestational diabetic (pGDM) women are characterized by high cardiovascular risk (CVR). The aim of this study was to assess the CVR markers levels in non-diabetic pGDM women in relation to time postpartum and to soluble E-selectin (sES) level. We investigated 125 women aged 18-40 years with a history of GDM between 2 and 24 months after their pregnancy. We evaluated age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, glucose levels during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), levels of insulin and the parameters of endothelial dysfunction, fibrinolysis activity, low-grade systemic inflammation and lipid profiles. Prediabetes was identified in 38 women (30%), while in the remaining women OGTT results were normal. The tests performed >6 months revealed decreased hs-CRP (p?=?0.01), sICAM-1 (p?=?0.01), and elevated sES (p?=?0.01) >12 months after adjustment for age, BMI, waist circumference and 2?h OGTT glucose. In the subgroup tested ?12 months after an index pregnancy sES was independently associated with hs-CRP (p?<?0.0001) and triglycerides (p?=?0.0139). No association was found between sES and remaining parameters in women tested >12 months postpartum. We conclude that the period 2-24 months post GDM is heterogeneous with respect to the CVR markers. The plasma level of hs-CRP could be useful as an important cardiovascular risk marker up to 12 months postpartum in non-diabetic pGDM women.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734889","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.75828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.694493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.310219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.290163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.120444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
