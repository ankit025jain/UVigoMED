{"id":53536,"title":"A Long-term follow-up study of 91 cases with ovarian granulosa cell tumors.","abstract":"To evaluate the prognostic factors of ovarian granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) and treatment outcomes in recurrent GCT cases.We retrospectively reviewed 91 patients with GCT who were treated in two tertiary Centers between 1989 and 2011.Eighty patients had stage I tumors, five had stage II, and six had stage III. There were 15 cases of recurrence with a median follow-up time of 58 (3-254) months. Multivariate analysis identified greater tumor size and postoperative residual tumor as independent risk factors for recurrence. Twelve patients underwent secondary surgery at first recurrence. At a median follow-up of 50 (4-185) months from first recurrence, the 5-year survival was 60% for patients with and 100% for those without residual tumor after secondary surgery, respectively (p=0.018, log-rank test).Complete cytoreduction is an important prognostic factor for recurrent cases as well as initial treatment of GCT.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511046","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.560135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.373195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.345037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.226429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Granulosa cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulosa_cell"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"1989","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Government College of Technology, Coimbatore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_College_of_Technology,_Coimbatore"}]}
