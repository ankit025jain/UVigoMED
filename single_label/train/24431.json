{"id":24431,"title":"[Injuries to myocardium in infectious endocarditis].","abstract":"Clinical and morphological characteristics of myocardium in infectious endocarditis (IE) are described as exemplified by pathological changes in the vascular bed, stroma, and myofibrils. Multiple sclerotic changes in myocardium in the form of \"sheath sclerosis\" were revealed. It is shown that progress of cardiac insufficiency in IE may be due to specific changes in the heart muscle. The necessity of early diagnostics of myocardial lesions is discussed with reference to revision of antibiotic therapy and modern surgical treatment of lE.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437175","annotations":[{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myofibril","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibril"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.077164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Indo-European languages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
