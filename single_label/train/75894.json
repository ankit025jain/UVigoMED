{"id":75894,"title":"[Ten cases report of vascular compressive syndrome caused by the facial, acoustic nerves].","abstract":"To search the features and the treatment of vascular compressive syndrome caused by the facial, acoustic nerves.Ten cases of vascular compressive syndrome caused by the facial, acoustic nerves were included in the group,which were treated by microvascular decompression(MVD). Besides, the microanatomic relationship between the nerve and their adjacent vessel at the root exit zone (REZ) were observed under microscope or nasoendoscopy in MVD.Tinnitus, vertigo and facial spasm disappeared after MVD in 7 cases (70%), improved in 2 cases (20%), and relapse in 1 case (10%). All cases were found out vessels compressing at the root zone of the facial nerve and the auditory nerve.The Clinical features of vascular compressive syndrome caused by the facial, acoustic nerves are facial spasm, tinnitus, and vertigo, for which microvascular decompression has a positive therapeutic effect as long as the diagnosis is correct.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026816","annotations":[{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.690419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.610423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.604713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.559801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.294221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.180374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Russia)"},{"name":"Resurrection Band","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_Band"},{"name":"Microvascular decompression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microvascular_decompression"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"DNS root zone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"}]}
