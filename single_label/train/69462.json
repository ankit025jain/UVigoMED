{"id":69462,"title":"Hospital-based HIV/HSV-2 seroprevalence among male patients with anal disease in Korea: cross sectional study.","abstract":"This study aimed to identify the characteristics of HIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 seroprevalence in male patients with anal disease.HIV seroprevalence was estimated for different age groups of male patients with anal disease who were treated at Songdo colorectal hospital in Korea between 2001 and 2011. HIV seroprevalence of patients with anal disease was compared with that of patients with nonanal disease for each year from 2007 to 2011. HSV-2 antibody tests were conducted on 2,038 HIV-tested male patients with anal disease in 2009.For 11 years from 2001, HIV seroprevalence differed significantly by age group (P?<?0.001) and was highest in the group aged <20 years. From 2007 to 2011, HIV seroprevalence in patients with anal disease was 7.6/10,000-13.3/10,000 and that in patients with nonanal disease was 0-0.9/10,000. HSV-2 seroprevalence among patients with anal disease was 24.0%, and only one patient with HIV and HSV-2 was observed.HIV seroprevalencein male patients with anal disease was significantly higher than that for other diseases. HSV-2 seroprevalence was similar to that in the general male population. Implementation of the current HIV surveillance system for male patients at colorectal hospitals is necessary to help prevent HIV transmission.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444046","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.707482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.671518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.383733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.364098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.29426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.243978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.0495871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Nonanal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonanal"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"610","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/610"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Simplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"910","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/910"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Cross section (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
