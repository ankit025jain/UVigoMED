{"id":82448,"title":"The effect of antibacterial agents on fissure sealant microleakage: a 6-month in vitro study.","abstract":"To evaluate microleakage from an antibacterial adhesive and bonding agent added to the ssure sealant on intact enamel.One hundred twenty sound third mandibular molars were randomly divided into 6 groups of 20 teeth each. Occlusal pits and ssures were sealed with un lled sealant material (Clinpro, 3M) after pretreatment with 1. phosphoric acid etching (control); 2. acid etching + Adper Single Bond 2 (SB, 3M); 3. chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX, Ultradent) + acid etching; 4. CHX + acid etching + SB; 5. acid etching + Clear l Protect Bond (CPB, Kuraray) 6. CPB alone. After 6-month water storage and thermocycling, the specimens were placed in 0.5% fuschin, sectioned and evaluated under a digital microscope. The data were compared between groups with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests.Differences between groups were statistically signi cant at P < 0.05. Acid etching alone and with SB showed the lowest microleakage, followed by acid etching + CPB. Chlorhexidine with and without bonding agent showed the greatest microleakage.Conventional acid etching alone or with a one-bottle adhesive were the two most effective methods of reducing microleakage from ssures. Acid etching together with a self-etching adhesive showed better results than self-etching alone. Appling CHX increased microleakage in sealed teeth.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624384","annotations":[{"name":"Phosphoric acid","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.780197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.615273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.594855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.569393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.474686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Etching","weight":0.385993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etching"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.334918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.14736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"3M","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Thermal cycler","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_cycler"},{"name":"Kuraray","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuraray"},{"name":"Digital microscope","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_microscope"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Coal mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining"},{"name":"Effective results in number theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_results_in_number_theory"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Glass etching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_etching"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Involuntary commitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment"},{"name":"Data storage device","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage_device"},{"name":"Fissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure"},{"name":"Appling, Georgia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appling,_Georgia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cant (language)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_(language)"},{"name":"Sealant","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealant"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
