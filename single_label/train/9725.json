{"id":9725,"title":"Post-conditioning with sevoflurane induces heme oxygenase-1 expression via the PI3K/Akt pathway in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression induced by sevoflurane (Sevo) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)?induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into six groups: (A) Control, (B) 2.4% Sevo only, (C) LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) only, (D) LPS + 2.4% Sevo, (E) LY294002 + LPS + 2.4% Sevo and (F) LPS only. The pathological changes in wet/dry weight ratio (W/D), the activities of superoxide dismutase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde, and HO-1, as well as the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), HO-1, phospho-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pPI3K) and phospho-Akt (pAkt) were recorded. Sevo post-conditioning was able to effectively protect from ALI with decreasing pathomorphological scores, MPO activity, W/D and the mRNA and protein expression levels of ICAM-1. Sevo promotes HO-1 expression via the PI3K/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway with activation of pPI3K and pAkt. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 partly eliminates the protective effects of Sevo. It is concluded that Sevo post-conditioning has a vital role in inducing the upregulation of HO-1 expression via the PI3K/Akt pathway to alleviate ALI.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691522","annotations":[{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.875478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Heme","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.690673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.631157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.450172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.391579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.279128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Heme oxygenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme_oxygenase"},{"name":"Acute lung injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lung_injury"},{"name":"LY294002","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LY294002"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Oxygenase","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenase"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"}]}
