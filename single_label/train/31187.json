{"id":31187,"title":"[Efficacy of AboundTM for hand-foot syndrome caused by capecitabine].","abstract":"Hand-foot syndrome( HFS) has been reported to be the most common adverse effect of capecitabine, with an incidence of more than 50%. AboundTM, containing ?-hydroxy-?-methyl butyric acid( HMB), L-glutamine, and L-arginine is effective in the treatment of decubitus ulcers and in wound healing; however, whether AboundTM is efficacious for HFS caused by capecitabine is not clear. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of AboundTM in the recovery from HFS caused by capecitabine. Capecitabine administration was discontinued in 6 patients with more than grade 2 HFS, and AboundTM was administered. The time to recovery was examined. The median time to recovery to less than grade 1 HFS was 10 days( range, 4-14 days). The grade of HFS decreased following the administration of AboundTM. The findings of this study suggest that AboundTM is effective against HFS caused by capecitabine.
