{"id":62803,"title":"JAK2 mutation: an aid in the diagnosis of occult myeloproliferative neoplasms in patients with major intraabdominal vein thrombosis and normal blood counts.","abstract":"Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) is mutated in a high proportion of patients with polycythemia vera and in a smaller number with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. Mutated JAK2 is an important diagnostic marker for myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and may also play a major role in the pathogenesis of MPN.To evaluate the prevalence of mutated JAK2 (JAK2-V617F) among patients with major intraabdominal vein thrombosis who had normal blood counts at diagnosis of the initial event.The medical records of patients who presented with a major intraabdominal venous thrombosis and normal peripheral blood counts were obtained. JAK2-V617F mutation status was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.Twenty-two patients were available for this analysis and 9 (41%) were found to have JAK2-V617F. Patients with positive JAK2-V617F were younger and had more frequent clinical splenomegaly than those with wild-type JAK2.A high proportion of patients presenting with \"idiopathic\" major intraabdominal vein thrombosis and normal blood counts carry JAK2-V617F. We recommend searching for the mutation in this clinical setting to detect patients with occult MPN.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511651","annotations":[{"name":"Myelofibrosis","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelofibrosis"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.821942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Polycythemia vera","weight":0.8214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycythemia_vera"},{"name":"Essential thrombocytosis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Myeloproliferative disease","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloproliferative_disease"},{"name":"Polycythemia","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycythemia"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.69807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Thrombocytosis","weight":0.398803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Janus kinase 2","weight":0.208017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_2"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.144454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Janus kinase","weight":0.0152908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
