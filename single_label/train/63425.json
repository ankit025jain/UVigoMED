{"id":63425,"title":"Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia: a rare benign vascular tumor of breast.","abstract":"Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia typically involves head and neck with rare involvement of other sites like breast. A 27year old female presented with a painless swelling in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast. Fine needle aspiration cytology showed sheets of lymphoid cells along with numerous eosinophils. Subsequent histopathological examination showed eosinophilic plump and vacuolated endothelial cells in small groups and sheets within a fibrous background, typically accompanied by lymphoid aggregates and eosinophils, suggestive of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Vascular tumors of the breast are extremely rare. The goal of this case report is to advert to this unusual clinical picture, to review and discuss diagnostics, differential diagnoses and treatment options.
