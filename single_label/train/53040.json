{"id":53040,"title":"HDL cholesterol levels and weight are the main determinants of subclinical atherosclerosis in the young with type 1 diabetes and suitable glycaemic control.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis and related factors in young type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients and healthy peers. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and anthropometric/laboratorial data were obtained for 83 T1D patients (mean age 19.5 ± 4.0 years, disease duration 9.8 ± 4.8 years) and for 36 matched healthy subjects. Considering all the participants as one group, male sex (p = 0.008), weight (p = 0.016) and T1D (p < 0.001) were positively associated with a higher cIMT. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p = 0.036) was negatively associated with cIMT in T1D. In the male T1D patients, HDL ?47.5 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 57% (p = 0.035) in detecting those belonging to a higher cIMT tercile. In conclusion, weight and T1D were associated with increased cIMT. HDL levels ?47.5 mg/dL were related to a higher cIMT in male T1D patients.
