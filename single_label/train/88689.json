{"id":88689,"title":"The clinical outcomes of early internal fixation for undisplaced femoral neck fractures and early full weight-bearing in elderly patients.","abstract":"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of early internal fixation for undisplaced femoral neck fractures and early full weight-bearing in patients aged 65 years and older.The records of consecutive patients who underwent surgery for undisplaced femoral neck fractures between 1999 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients underwent the surgery as early as possible, and allowed early full weight-bearing. The interval between initial injury and surgery, time to admission and operation, operation time, decrease in hemoglobin, the postoperative day starting to walk, postoperative walking status, and the incidence of any secondary procedures were evaluated. The average patient age was 77.5 years and the average duration of postoperative follow-up was 46.8 months. The patients were divided to two groups to determine the effect of early operation: the early operation group within 24 h on admission, and the late operation group done 24 h after admission.Eighty-six percent of surgeries were performed within 48 h of admission. The average operation time was 46 min (range 20-95 min). Transfusions were performed in 6.9 % (4/58) of patients. The mortality rate was 6.9 %, and the rate of complications was 9.3 % (5/54): four cases of avascular necrosis (AVN) and one case of fixation failure. The rate of secondary procedures was 7.4 % (4/54). Seventy-two percent (39/54) of patients recovered their postoperative walking ability to pre-injury levels.This study demonstrated that early internal fixation of undisplaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients produced satisfactory clinical outcomes.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24806536","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.86178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.71503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.625983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.46404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.391439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.341876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.119746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0666069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"2090s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2090s"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Bond duration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_duration"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"}]}
