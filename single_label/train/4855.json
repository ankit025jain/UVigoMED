{"id":4855,"title":"First reported case of elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus infection in Laos.","abstract":"The elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) is now recognized as one of the main causes of death of young Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in North American zoos. Its impact in wild and domestic elephant populations in Asia is not clearly understood. This article describes the first case of EEHV infection in Lao People's Democratic Republic of a 2.5-yr-old domestic male Asian elephant. Clinical signs and pathological findings reported here are consistent with previous infections in Asian elephant calves. Phylogenetic analyses showed 100% homology with other EEHV-1A strains identified in Asia, Europe, and North America. Contamination of the molecular assays was ruled out, because the DNA polymerase sequence identified in this study differed from the positive control by two base pairs.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25314848","annotations":[{"name":"DNA","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.771724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.751623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Elephant","weight":0.686142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.634577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.631065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.560651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.502951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Laos","weight":0.501914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.417882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.372892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.35336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.322917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.308239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Zoo","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo"},{"name":"Asian elephant","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Calf","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Republic of Ireland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Sign language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"}]}
