{"id":30892,"title":"Molecular mechanisms of stem cell therapy in alcoholic liver disease.","abstract":"Alcoholic liver disease affects a great number of people worldwide. With limited therapeutic options, stem cell therapy offers significant potential for these patients. To date, a limited number of clinical trials have produced transient clinical responses to cell therapy in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Stem cell therapy to reorganize the postnatal liver is an important theme and mission for patients with chronic liver disorders including alcoholic liver injury. We therefore should redevelop the evidence of cell-based liver regeneration therapy, focusing on targets (disease, patient's status and hepatic function), materials (cells, cytokines and genes), and methodology (stem cell types and their derived microparticles, transplantation route, implantation technology and tissue engineering). In this review, we summarize the recent findings regarding the experimental and clinical use of mesenchymal and liver stem cells, focusing mainly on the treatment of alcoholic liver disorders and their relevance in the field of regenerative medicine, and advances on the role of microvesicles and exosomes in this process. We discuss new advances in stem cell therapy from liver regeneration to liver re-organization, which is involved in the recent progress of on-going clinical trials, basic research in stem cell therapy and liver regeneration, and updated exosomes/microvesicles recovery/repairing technology.
