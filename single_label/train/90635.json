{"id":90635,"title":"Cost-minimization analysis of two fluid products for resuscitation of critically injured trauma patients.","abstract":"Results of a study to determine potential cost benefits of substituting an alternative electrolyte solution for 0.9% sodium chloride injection for the initial fluid resuscitation of trauma patients are presented.Using data from a randomized clinical trial that compared 24-hour fluid resuscitation outcomes in critically injured trauma patients treated with 0.9% sodium chloride injection and those who received a balanced electrolyte solution (Plasma-Lyte A, Baxter Healthcare), a cost-minimization analysis was performed at a large medical center. The outcomes evaluated included fluid and drug acquisition costs, materials and nurse labor costs, and costs associated with electrolyte replacement.The use of Plasma-Lyte A was associated with a relatively higher fluid acquisition cost but a reduced need for magnesium replacement. During the first 24 hours of hospitalization, 4 of 24 patients (17%) treated with 0.9% sodium chloride injection and none of the patients who received the comparator product (n = 22) required supplemental magnesium. Patients treated with 0.9% sodium chloride injection received a median of 4 g of magnesium (interquartile range [IQR], 2.5-4.0 g), compared with a median of 0 g (IQR 0-2 g) in the comparator group. Taking into account the costs of consumable supplies and nursing labor, the cost-minimization analysis indicated a 24-hour cost differential of $12.35 in favor of Plasma-Lyte A.Substitution of Plasma-Lyte A for 0.9% sodium chloride injection for fluid resuscitation during the first 24 hours after traumatic injury was associated with decreased magnesium replacement requirements and a net cost benefit to the institution.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589538","annotations":[{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.814694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.5788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.567247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.540531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.308015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.19725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.13456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Baxter International","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_International"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Wage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"}]}
