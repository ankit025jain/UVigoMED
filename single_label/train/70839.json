{"id":70839,"title":"Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of serum cytokine levels in breast cancer.","abstract":"This study was designed to examine the serum levels of six cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) in treated and untreated breast cancer patients and assess their clinical significance. The correlation of the Th1/Th2 type cytokine levels and the clinicopathologic variables was further evaluated.Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) was used to examine the levels of Th1 cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) in serum of 36 untreated and 73 treated breast cancer patients and 51 healthy females as control.In the untreated group, the levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-5 were significantly higher than in control group (p < 0.05). IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-5, and IL-10 levels were higher in treated group than in untreated group (p < 0.05); IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio of the treated group was higher than the untreated group (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the cytokine levels were significantly different in different pTNM stages and lymph node involvement groups. Survival analysis revealed that the IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio, pTNM stage, and lymph node involvement affected the survival of breast cancer patients. The pTNM stage was an independent significant prognostic factor.Breast cancer patients presented a Th1/Th2 imbalance and immune function disorder, which correlated with pTNM stage and lymph node involvement. Higher IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio predicted a favorable outcome in breast cancer patients.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134383","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.731997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.699349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.623249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.62001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.597475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.585205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.564358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.527719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.434151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"}]}
