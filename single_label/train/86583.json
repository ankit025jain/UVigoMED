{"id":86583,"title":"Stat3 inhibits Beclin 1 expression through recruitment of HDAC3 in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that Beclin 1, a key regulator of autophagic process, is frequently downregulated and may serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for nonsmall cell lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its downregulation remain poorly understood. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is a transcription factor which plays a crucial role for multiple tumor growth and progression. Here, we demonstrate that Beclin 1 is a direct transcriptional target of Stat3 in lung cancer cells. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) treatment or transfection of a constitutively activated Stat3 in AGS and NCI-H1650 cells inhibited Beclin 1 expression. At the molecular level, we further revealed that Stat3 could directly bind to the promoter region of Beclin 1 and repressed its transcription through recruiting histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Collectively, our results suggest that the activated Stat3 may represent an important mechanism for Beclin 1 downregulation in nonsmall cell lung cancer development.
