{"id":91941,"title":"How to teach emergency procedural skills in an outdoor environment using low-fidelity simulation.","abstract":"Teaching emergency procedural skills in a wilderness setting can be logistically challenging. To teach these skills as part of a wilderness medicine elective for medical students, we designed an outdoor simulation session with low-fidelity models. The session involved 6 stations in which procedural skills were taught using homemade low-fidelity simulators. At each station, the students encountered a \"victim,\" who required an emergency procedure that was performed using the low-fidelity model. The models are easy and inexpensive to construct, and their design and implementation in the session is described here. Using low-fidelity simulation models in an outdoor setting is an effective teaching tool for emergency wilderness medicine procedures and can easily be reproduced in future wilderness medicine courses.
