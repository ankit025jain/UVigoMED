{"id":51837,"title":"Subclinical and overt thyroid dysfunction and risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events: a large population study.","abstract":"Thyroid dysfunction has been associated with both increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but limited data are available on mild thyroid dysfunction and cause-specific mortality.The objective of the study was to examine the risk of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and cause-specific events in subjects with overt and subclinical thyroid dysfunction.This was a retrospective cohort study.Participants in the study were subjects who underwent thyroid blood tests, without prior thyroid disease, consulting their general practitioner in 2000-2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark.All-cause mortality, MACEs, and cause-specific events identified in nationwide registries were measured.A total of 47 327 (8.4%) deaths occurred among 563 700 included subjects [mean age 48.6 (SD Â± 18.2) y; 39% males]. All-cause mortality was increased in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism [age adjusted incidence rates of 16 and 15 per 1000 person-years, respectively; incidence rate ratios (IRRs) 1.25 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.36] and 1.23 (95% CI 1.16-1.30)] compared with euthyroid (incidence rate of 12 per 1000 person-years). Risk of MACEs was elevated in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism [IRRs 1.16 (95% CI 1.05-1.27) and 1.09 (95% CI 1.02-1.16)] driven by heart failure [IRRs 1.14 (95% CI 0.99-1.32) and 1.20 (95% CI 1.10-1.31)]. A reduction of all-cause mortality was observed in subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH of 5-10 mIU/L [IRR 0.92 (95% CI 0.86-0.98)].Heart failure is the leading cause of an increased cardiovascular mortality in both overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 5-10 mIU/L might be associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654753","annotations":[{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.935439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.84024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.667629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.346382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.332676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Copenhagen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen"},{"name":"Euthyroid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyroid"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
