{"id":55087,"title":"Combination of bevacizumab and bromfenac therapy in age-related macular degeneration: a pilot study.","abstract":"According to recent studies, the newest strategy for the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration is to combine anti-VEGF agents with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as nepafenac and bromfenac to decrease the frequency of intravitreal injections. Since most research has focused on ranibizumab, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether an alternative drug such as bevacizumab could lead to similar outcomes.The study was conducted on a group of 26 patients who were administered intravitreal bevacizumab and topical bromfenac (study group) and 26 patients with single bevacizumab therapy (control group). Cases that were not qualified for ranibizumab therapy were included in the study group.The study revealed that the visual acuity and parameters observed in OCT improved more in the study group than in the control group. However, the correlations between the above factors and the frequency of intravitreal injections were statistically significant only in visual acuity.We recommend the combined therapy of bevacizumab and bromfenac as an alternative and beneficial method of treatment in patients with exudative AMD who do not qualify for ranibizumab therapy. This combined therapy might efficiently reduce the number of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25006692","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.934886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.803739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.661366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.564087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.382877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Bromfenac","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromfenac"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"}]}
