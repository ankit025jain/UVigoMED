{"id":14325,"title":"Proteomic analysis of the immunosuppressive effects of mesenchymal stem cells in a rat heart transplantation model.","abstract":"Some reports suggest mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have immunosuppressive properties. However, conflicting evidence regarding the role of MSCs has emerged.To gain a better understanding of the immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a rat heart transplantation model.MSCs were obtained from the femoral and tibial bone marrow of Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured. Heart-transplanted rats were allocated into a MSC-treated group and 2 control groups. On postoperative day 7, 1 rat was sacrificed and the pathological changes of heart tissues were assessed. Serum proteomic spectra were generated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS).Rat MSCs displayed the typical spindle-shaped morphology in culture and significantly prolonged the graft survival up to 33.25 ± 2.54 days compared with controls (19.75 ± 1.56 and 11.16 ± 1.34 days, respectively). Pathological analysis showed the inflammatory cell infiltration in the MSC-treated group was significantly reduced. SELDI analysis showed that 5 protein/peptide peaks with M/Z 1272.33, 1986.65, 2323.42, 5375.59 and 12968.11 were up-regulated in the MSC-treated group (P < 0.001).Donor-derived MSCs clearly alleviate acute rejection following heart transplantation in rats and significantly prolong the isograft survival time.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24431306","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.71083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.649827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.645549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.479276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.469872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.365311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.135513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0425622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Andes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1986","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986"},{"name":"Monozygotic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monozygotic"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
