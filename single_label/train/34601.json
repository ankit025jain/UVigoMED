{"id":34601,"title":"A familial disorder of altered DNA-methylation.","abstract":"In a subset of imprinting disorders caused by epimutations, multiple imprinted loci are affected. Familial occurrence of multilocus imprinting disorders is rare.We have investigated the clinical and molecular features of a familial DNA-methylation disorder.Tissues of affected individuals and blood samples of family members were investigated by conventional and molecular karyotyping. Sanger sequencing and RT-PCR of imprinting-associated genes (NLRP2, NLRP7, ZFP57, KHDC3L, DNMT1o), exome sequencing and locus-specific, array-based and genome-wide technologies to determine DNA-methylation were performed.In three offspring of a healthy couple, we observed prenatal onset of severe growth retardation and dysmorphism associated with altered DNA-methylation at paternally and maternally imprinted loci. Array-based analyses in various tissues of the offspring identified the DNA-methylation of 2.1% of the genes in the genome to be recurrently altered. Despite significant enrichment of imprinted genes (OR 9.49), altered DNA-methylation predominately (90.2%) affected genes not known to be imprinted. Sequencing of genes known to cause comparable conditions and exome sequencing in affected individuals and their ancestors did not unambiguously point to a causative gene.The family presented herein suggests the existence of a familial disorder of DNA-methylation affecting imprinted but also not imprinted gene loci potentially caused by a maternal effect mutation in a hitherto not identified gene.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721835","annotations":[{"name":"Maternal effect","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_effect"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genomic imprinting","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.653936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Frederick Sanger","weight":0.495466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger"},{"name":"DNA methyltransferase","weight":0.488905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.436741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Non-Mendelian inheritance","weight":0.307955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Mendelian_inheritance"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.185378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.178016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Dwarfism","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarfism"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0652597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Patrilineality","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineality"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Dysmorphic feature","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmorphic_feature"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
