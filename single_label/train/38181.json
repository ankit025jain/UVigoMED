{"id":38181,"title":"Polymorphisms of VEGF, TGF?1, TGF?R2 and conotruncal heart defects in a Chinese population.","abstract":"Genetic variants may determine susceptibility of congenital heart disease (CHD). To evaluate the impact of transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF?1), TGF? receptor II (TGF?R2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms on conotruncal heart defects susceptibility, we genotyped six functional polymorphisms TGF?1 rs1800469 C>T, TGF?R2 rs3087465 G>A, VEGF -2578C>A, -1498T>C, -634G>C and +936C>T in a hospital based case-control study of 244 conotruncal heart defects cases and 136 non-CHD controls in a Chinese population. Logistic regression analyses revealed that if the TGF?1 rs1800469 CC homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, subjects carrying the CT variant heterozygote had a significant 0.48-fold decreased risk of conotruncal heart defects [odds ratio (OR) = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.30-0.88], subjects carrying the TT variant homozygote had a significant 0.47-fold decreased risk of conotruncal heart defects (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.28-1.00). In stratification analyses, the TGF?1 rs1800469 C>T genotype was associated with a decreased risk for tetralogy of fallot in homozygote comparisons (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22-0.99), a decreased risk for transposition of great artery in the dominant genetic model (OR 0.49; 95 % CI 0.28-0.87) and heterozygote comparisons (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.24-0.83). Our findings suggest that TGF?1 rs1800469 C>T polymorphism was significantly associated with decreased risk of conotruncal heart defects. TGF?R2 rs3087465 G>A, VEGF -2578C>A, -1498T>C, -634G>C and +936C>T polymorphisms may not play a role in the susceptibility of conotruncal heart defects.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443223","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Homozygote","weight":0.841508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygote"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.775158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Heterozygote","weight":0.772217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.757844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.693938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.625426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.569611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.563904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.431575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.323331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.275402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.113223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0998945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Transposon","weight":0.0728129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
