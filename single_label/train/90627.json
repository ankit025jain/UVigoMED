{"id":90627,"title":"Cerebral sinus thrombosis in a 6-year-old boy after a minor head injury.","abstract":"Posttraumatic cerebral sinus thrombosis is an uncommon disease in children that is rarely seen in the setting of a closed head injury. We report a 6-year-old boy who developed cerebral sinus thrombosis after an apparent minor head injury. The clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and treatment strategies are discussed. Serial neurological evaluation and close observation are important, and the decision for anticoagulation should be carefully considered with hematological consultants.
