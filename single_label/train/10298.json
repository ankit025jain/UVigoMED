{"id":10298,"title":"Changes in the mitochondrial network during ectromelia virus infection of permissive L929 cells.","abstract":"Mitochondria are extremely important organelles in the life of a cell. Recent studies indicate that mitochondria also play a fundamental role in the cellular innate immune mechanisms against viral infections. Moreover, mitochondria are able to alter their shape continuously through fusion and fission. These tightly regulated processes are activated or inhibited under physiological or pathological (e.g. viral infection) conditions to help restore homeostasis. However, many types of viruses, such as orthopoxviruses, have developed various strategies to evade the mitochondrial-mediated antiviral innate immune responses. Moreover, orthopoxviruses exploit the mitochondria for their survival. Such viral activity has been reported during vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. Our study shows that the Moscow strain of ectromelia virus (ECTV-MOS), an orthopoxvirus, alters the mitochondrial network in permissive L929 cells. Upon infection, the branching structure of the mitochondrial network collapses and becomes disorganized followed by destruction of mitochondrial tubules during the late stage of infection. Small, discrete mitochondria co-localize with progeny virions, close to the cell membrane. Furthermore, clustering of mitochondria is observed around viral factories, particularly between the nucleus and viroplasm. Our findings suggest that ECTV-MOS modulates mitochondrial cellular distribution during later stages of the replication cycle, probably enabling viral replication and/or assembly as well as transport of progeny virions inside the cell. However, this requires further investigation.
