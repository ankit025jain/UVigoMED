{"id":53288,"title":"Laparoscopic enucleation of insulinoma in a patient with annular pancreas: a rare case.","abstract":"Insulinoma and annular pancreas are both rare disorders. In this report, we describe a patient who had insulinoma in association with an annular pancreas.Because the computed tomography scan revealed no relationship between the tumor and the major pancreatic duct, we performed a laparoscopic insulinoma enucleation. As for the asymptomatic annular pancreas, no bypass procedure was performed. The patient recovered well.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526521","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.82705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Insulinoma","weight":0.796716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulinoma"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.546441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.533539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.499803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Annular pancreas","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_pancreas"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0483347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Annulus (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"}]}
