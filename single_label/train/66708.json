{"id":66708,"title":"Prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its contributing risk factors in southern Iran: a cross-sectional adult population-based study.","abstract":"The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing consistently. Progression of CKD to end-stage renal disease could be slowed down by early detection and treatment, yet CKD and its risk factors have been poorly studied in many countries. This study investigated the CKD prevalence and its contributing risk factors in adult population of Southern Iran.In this cross-sectional study on randomly recruited participants from adult population, we investigated the CKD prevalence (stages 3 to 5) and its risk factors in Southern Iran. After calculation of sample size (10385 cases), data was collected in a total of 10397 individuals. Medical and demographic data was obtained, as well as measurement of height, body weight, blood pressure, and blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine. A fresh spot urinalysis was also performed.The overall prevalence of CKD stages 3 to 5 was 11.6%. Stages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of CKD were found in 8.5%, 66.1%, 11.4%, 0.1%, and 0.1% of the participants, respectively. The prevalence of CKD (stages 3 to 5) was significantly higher compared to those with the non-CKD group, in the older than younger participants, and in the women as compared to the men. There was a strong positive correlation between age, female sex, hypertension, and high body mass index with different stages of CKD.The prevalence of CKD is high in Southern Iran and its contributing risk factors are older age, female sex, hypertension, and high body mass index.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685733","annotations":[{"name":"Blood urea nitrogen","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_urea_nitrogen"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Urinalysis","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinalysis"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.744023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.412673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.367787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.250134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.151262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
