{"id":15260,"title":"Imported African histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent patient 40 years after staying in a disease-endemic area.","abstract":"Histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii is a rare disease outside central and western Africa. In Europe, all cases are imported. We report a case of an African histoplasmosis with isolated pulmonary involvement in a non-immunocompromised patient that occurred 40 years after his stay in a disease-endemic area. The patient was given itraconazole. (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography was used to assess evolution during treatment. The outcome for the patient was favorable.
