{"id":71881,"title":"BRCA1 mRNA levels following a 4-6-week intervention with oral 3,3'-diindolylmethane.","abstract":"Haploinsufficiency may contribute to the development of breast cancer among women with a BRCA1 mutation. Thus, interventions that enhance BRCA1 expression may represent avenues for prevention. Studies have shown that 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) can upregulate BRCA1 expression in breast cancer cells. This has yet to be demonstrated in vivo.We conducted a study to evaluate the ability of oral DIM to upregulate BRCA1 mRNA expression in white blood cells. A total of 18 women were enroled in the study, including 13 BRCA1 mutation carriers who received 300?mg per day of Rx Balance BioResponse DIM for 4-6 weeks (intervention group) and 5 BRCA1 mutation carriers who did not take DIM (control group). BRCA1 mRNA expression was assessed at baseline and at 4-6 weeks by real-time, quantitative PCR and the relative change in BRCA1 mRNA expression (that is, 2(-??CT)) was calculated.The relative change in BRCA1 mRNA expression among women in the intervention group achieved borderline significance (P paired t-test=0.05). In the intervention group, BRCA1 mRNA expression increased in 10 of the participants, decreased in 2 and remained unchanged in 1 of the participants following DIM intervention (P sign test=0.02). On average, women in the intervention group experienced a 34% increase in BRCA1 mRNA expression (range -24 to 194%). There was no significant difference in the relative change in BRCA1 mRNA expression among women in the control group (P paired t-test=0.45).Under the tested conditions, oral DIM was associated with an increase in BRCA1 mRNA expression in women with a BRCA1 mutation. The possibility of mitigating the effect of an inherited deleterious BRCA1 mutation by increasing the physiologic expression of the gene and normalising protein levels represents a clinically important paradigm shift in the prevention strategies available to these high-risk women. Future studies with a larger sample size and higher doses of DIM are warranted.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25025957","annotations":[{"name":"BRCA1","weight":0.914879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.678803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.646195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Haploinsufficiency","weight":0.625339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haploinsufficiency"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.57384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.468227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.440035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.261899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.252482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"BRCA mutation","weight":0.155041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA_mutation"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0544569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
