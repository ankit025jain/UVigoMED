{"id":82369,"title":"[Interceptive treatment of maxillary hypoplasia with the use of bone anchors. A review of the literature].","abstract":"A Class III malocclusion is mainly caused by a hypoplastic maxilla and therefore the treatment is principally aimed at stimulating the growth of the maxilla. Disadvantages of conventional treatment methods are that treatment effects are mainly dentoalveolar rather than skeletal and that there is often an increase in the height of the lowerface. Moreover, patients are not always cooperative about wearing extra-oral appliances. Because of these disadvantages, a new treatment approach has been developed which makes use of skeletal anchoring. In this new technique, called 'bone anchored maxillary protraction, bone anchors are placed on both sides of the maxilla and the mandibula, onto which Class III elastics are attached. The literature shows that good results have been achieved with this method. Disadvantages of this method are that the placement of the bone anchors requires a surgical procedure and that complications, like the loosening or breaking of the anchors, can occur.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640296","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.656547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.44291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.442075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.161252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.14807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.132628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Maxillary hypoplasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_hypoplasia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"News presenter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Protraction","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protraction"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"}]}
