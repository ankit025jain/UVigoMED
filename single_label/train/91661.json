{"id":91661,"title":"Heat-related deaths in Adelaide, South Australia: review of the literature and case findings - an Australian perspective.","abstract":"Heat waves are not uncommon in Australia, but the event of 2009 was particularly severe and ranks third of the 21 recorded heat wave events in south-eastern Australia in terms of the resulting mortality and morbidity. This is a review of Coronial autopsy findings in South Australia (which has an area of nearly 1 million square kilometres with a population of 1.6 million that predominantly resides within the region of the capital: Adelaide) during the period of the 2009 heat wave. Fifty-four post-mortem examinations were performed on cases in which exposure to high ambient temperature was regarded as having caused or significantly contributed to the death. The findings (including results of toxicological and biochemical analyses, where available) are reviewed and compared with the post-mortem examination findings in 22 deaths over the same period not attributed to the effects of heat. There were no specific autopsy findings that distinguished heat-related from non heat-related deaths. The lack of specific post-mortem findings increases the reliance on scene investigation in order to be able to categorise a death as being heat-related. A checklist for scene investigators is proposed in order to assist with collection of relevant data to assist the Coronial investigation process.
