{"id":86881,"title":"[Identification of prototype foamy virus Bel1 nuclear localization signal and its corresponding importins].","abstract":"Bel1, a transactivator of prototype foamy virus (PFV), plays pivotal roles in the replication of PFV. Previous studies have shown that Bel1 bears a nuclear localization signal (NLS), but its amino acid sequence remains unclear and the corresponding importins have not been identified. In this report, we inserted various fragments of Bel1 into an EGFP-GST fusion protein and investigated their subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. We found that the 215PRQKRPR221 fragment could direct nuclear localization, which accords with the consensus sequence K(K/R)X(K/R) of monopartite NLS. Point mutation experiments revealed that K218, R219, and R221 are essential for the nuclear localization of Bel1. The results of the GST-pulldown showed that the Bel1 fragment with residues 215-223, which bears the NLS, interacts with KPNA1, KPNA6, and KPNA7. This result suggests that KPNA1, KPNA6, and KPNA7 maybe involved in Bel1 nuclear translocation.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272585","annotations":[{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.935439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Protein targeting","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.71292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.647192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.643326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.527546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Nuclear localization signal","weight":0.495115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_localization_signal"},{"name":"Transactivation","weight":0.490986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactivation"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.487242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Consensus sequence","weight":0.485433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_sequence"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.407459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.30582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Subcellular localization","weight":0.0804089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcellular_localization"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Karyopherin alpha 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyopherin_alpha_1"},{"name":"Importin","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importin"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"}]}
