{"id":88157,"title":"Effect of bone fragment impact velocity on biomechanical parameters related to spinal cord injury: a finite element study.","abstract":"Several experimental and computational studies have investigated the effect of bone fragment impact on the spinal cord during trauma. However, the effect of the impact velocity of a fragment generated by a burst fracture on the stress and strain inside the spinal cord has not been computationally investigated, even though spinal canal occlusion and peak pressure at various impact velocities were provided in experimental studies. These stresses and strains are known factors related to clinical symptoms or injuries. In this study, a fluid-structure interaction model of the spinal cord, dura mater, and cerebrospinal fluid was developed and validated. The von-Mises stress distribution in the cord, the longitudinal strain, the cord compression and cross-sectional area at the impact center, and the obliteration of the cerebrospinal fluid layer were analyzed for three pellet sizes at impact velocities ranging from 1.5m/s to 7.5m/s. The results indicate that stress in the cord was substantially elevated when the initial impact velocity of the pellet exceeded a threshold of 4.5m/s. Cord compression, reduction in cross-sectional area, and obliteration of the cerebrospinal fluid increased gradually as the velocity of the pellet increased, regardless of the size of the pellet. The present study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying spinal cord injury.
