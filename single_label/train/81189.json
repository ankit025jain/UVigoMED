{"id":81189,"title":"Aesthetic and functional rehabilitation of child using mock-up combined with stratified technique.","abstract":"The loss of the vertical dimension of occlusion in children with quickly progressing early childhood caries hinders the aesthetic rehabilitation of primary incisors. Minimally invasive restorations using chemical-mechanical caries removal methods preserve sound dental tissue and maintains the health of the pulp. This is the treatment of choice for children and allows crown reconstruction of the primary incisors without the need for endodontic treatment. The resources employed in the rehabilitation process range from biological restorations to direct and indirect crowns with or without the aid of a celluloid matrix.The aim of this study was to describe a case of maxillary incisor rehabilitation in a female patient aged two years five months using a mock-up combined with the stratified technique and Planas' direct tracks. After a 26-month follow-up period only a little fracture of the reconstructed incisor had occurred. Clinical Implications: In the case described, neuro-occlusal and functional rehabilitation enabled the establishment of satisfactory aesthetics in the primary incisors.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299027","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.672806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.600869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.548175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Endodontics","weight":0.425476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.360089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.313689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.146849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Celluloid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celluloid"},{"name":"Vertical dimension of occlusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_dimension_of_occlusion"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Mockup","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Early childhood education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_education"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
