{"id":91249,"title":"Three-dimensional in vivo kinematics during elbow flexion in patients with lateral humeral condyle nonunion by an image-matching technique.","abstract":"An established nonunion of the lateral humeral condyle often reveals elbow instability and accompanying pain. The purpose of this study was to obtain 3-dimensional and quantitative information about the pathologic kinematics of the ulnohumeral joint with nonunion of the lateral humeral condyle by an in vivo and 3-dimensional motion analysis.Magnetic resonance or computed tomography images of the elbows of 14 patients were acquired in 3 positions between full extension and full flexion. We evaluated ulnohumeral motion and calculated the change in the length of the medial collateral ligament during elbow flexion.Ulnohumeral motion was associated with an excessive lateral shift of ulnar movement. In addition, the distal part of the ulna was rotated in the varus direction, leading to a decrease in the carrying angle. The ulna tended to exhibit internal rotation from full extension to 90° of flexion of the elbow. With further flexion, the ulna rotated externally and returned to its neutral position. Furthermore, the length of the medial collateral ligament increased with an increase in the elbow flexion angle.Patients with lateral humeral condyle nonunion showed excessive lateral shift of the ulna and ulnar axial rotation. Also, the lateral shift caused an osseous protrusion of the medial trochlea, leading to elongation of the medial collateral ligament.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524982","annotations":[{"name":"Ulna","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"},{"name":"Medial collateral ligament","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.764089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.740291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.735738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Internal rotation","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rotation"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medial","weight":0.515945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial"},{"name":"Varus deformity","weight":0.507676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varus_deformity"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.429997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Trochlea of humerus","weight":0.400011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochlea_of_humerus"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.371901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Grappling position","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling_position"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Horse gait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"}]}
