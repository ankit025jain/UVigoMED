{"id":82776,"title":"Strengthening of oral health systems: oral health through primary health care.","abstract":"Around the globe many people are suffering from oral pain and other problems of the mouth or teeth. This public health problem is growing rapidly in developing countries where oral health services are limited. Significant proportions of people are underserved; insufficient oral health care is either due to low availability and accessibility of oral health care or because oral health care is costly. In all countries, the poor and disadvantaged population groups are heavily affected by a high burden of oral disease compared to well-off people. Promotion of oral health and prevention of oral diseases must be provided through financially fair primary health care and public health intervention. Integrated approaches are the most cost-effective and realistic way to close the gap in oral health between rich and poor. The World Health Organization (WHO) Oral Health Programme will work with the newly established WHO Collaborating Centre, Kuwait University, to strengthen the development of appropriate models for primary oral health care.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525450","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Kuwait","weight":0.722455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.639742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.628201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.513143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.220558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.1895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"World","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"},{"name":"Kuwait University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_University"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Doctorate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate"},{"name":"Government of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India"},{"name":"Mouth disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_disease"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"}]}
