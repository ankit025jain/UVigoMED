{"id":81874,"title":"Ki-67, TGF-?1, and elastin content are significantly altered in lip carcinogenesis.","abstract":"Epithelial changes observed in actinic cheilitis (AC) and lower lip squamous cell carcinoma (LLSCC) have been studied using different markers in order to observe diagnostic and prognostic factors for both lesions. The aim of the present study was to analyze Ki-67, TGF-?1, and elastin content in AC and LLSCC to determine the possible role of these proteins in lip carcinogenesis. Medical records of 29 cases of AC and 53 cases of LLSCC were analyzed. Lesions were classified according histological pattern and submitted to immunostaining for Ki-67, TGF-?1, and elastin. Different percentages of Ki-67-positive cells were found in AC depending on the degree of epithelial dysplasia (p?<?0.01). An association was also found between the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells and tumor grade in LLSCC (p?<?0.01). An inverse correlation was found between Ki-67 and TGF-?1 in AC and LLSCC (p?<?0.01). Elastosis was thinner and more discontinuous in LLSCC in comparison to AC, and this difference in the elastin immunolabeling pattern was statistically significant between groups (p?<?0.01). The present findings indicate that changes in Ki-67 and TGF-?1 content contribute to lip carcinogenesis. Furthermore, elastin content reflects changes in the extracellular matrix in both AC and LLSCC.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798972","annotations":[{"name":"Elastin","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastin"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.741125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.46853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.36494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.250655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Actinic cheilitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinic_cheilitis"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Cheilitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheilitis"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
