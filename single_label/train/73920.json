{"id":73920,"title":"A comparative study of the effects of inhibitory cytokines on human natural killer cells and the mechanistic features of transforming growth factor-beta.","abstract":"The major factors and mechanisms by which natural killer (NK) cells are inhibited in cancer patients have not yet been well defined. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the effects of TGF-?, IL-10, and IL-4 on primary NK cells, and it was demonstrated that (1) TGF-? most potently inhibited the overall function of NK cells. (2) It appears that TGF-? reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and the expression of c-myc. (3) It was also found that the IL-2-induced promoter-binding activities of C-myb, AP-1, CREB, and AR were also completely suppressed upon TGF-? treatment. Interestingly, TGF-? also completely suppressed other transcription factors, which are constitutively activated. Among these factors, we further confirmed roles of AP-1 in NK-92 cell activation through c-jun and MEK1 inhibitor assay. Our study provides insight into the effects of TGF-? in modulating NK cell functions.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879062","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.921744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.845838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.814652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Syk","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syk"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.680173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.570497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"CREB","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase","weight":0.485738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.388867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"AP-1 transcription factor","weight":0.380654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP-1_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0801006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Secretory pathway","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretory_pathway"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
