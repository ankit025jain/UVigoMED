{"id":38716,"title":"Correlation between posture, balance control, and peripheral muscle function in adults with cystic fibrosis.","abstract":"In addition to pulmonary involvement, adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at higher risk of developing skeletal muscle dysfunction, nutritional depletion, and bone and joint disease.This study aimed to assess the correlation between posture, balance, and peripheral muscle function in adults with CF.A cross-sectional study of 14 clinically stable patients who were subjected to postural assessment (photogrammetry), stabilometry, and peripheral muscle function.Comparing the right and left sides of the body, there were significant differences for the following variables: horizontal and vertical head alignments; heel angle; and vertical alignment of the trunk (p?<?0.001 for all). Variables that represent the head-trunk position and the position of the lower limbs showed correlations with stabilometric parameters. The strongest correlation was observed between the vertical alignment of the body and the medial-lateral range (??=?-0.73; p?=?0.002). We also noted a significant correlation between the quadriceps muscle strength and the medial lateral range (??=?-0.69; p?=?0.003).In adults with CF, it is possible that the imbalance occurs by both distortion of the head-trunk relationship and lower extremity abnormalities as noted by the reduced quadriceps muscle strength.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405398","annotations":[{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Quadriceps femoris muscle","weight":0.729731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.652985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.595057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.562484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.516559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.49889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.492779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.202022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.129799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Physical strength","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_strength"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Photogrammetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry"},{"name":"Heel","weight":0.0217977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Distortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Variable (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
