{"id":86405,"title":"[Pulmonary oedema in pregnancy: myocardial infarction as a possible cause].","abstract":"Pulmonary oedema in pregnancy may have various causes. A systematic approach to a pregnant woman with pulmonary oedema is important. Acute myocardial infarction should be considered during the differential diagnosis.A 30-year-old primigravida, who had been admitted with pre-eclampsia, complained of increasing shortness of breath at 28 weeks and 5 days gestation. She had pulmonary oedema, which was considered to be consistent with pre-eclampsia. A caesarean section was performed at 28 weeks and 6 days gestation because of increasing oxygen dependency. Following the caesarean section the patient was transferred to the ICU because of imminent respiratory failure, and a semi-acute anterior infarction was diagnosed by means of an ECG (estimated ejection fraction: 30%). The patient was discharged in a reasonable condition 8 days after the caesarean section.Differential diagnosis of pulmonary oedema during pregnancy is wide. Consultation with a cardiologist is recommended if a possible cardiac cause is suspected. Determination of troponin levels, ECG and an electrocardiogram should be the first diagnostic tools of choice in a pregnant patient.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780570","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.819097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.664444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.147128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.129516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"}]}
