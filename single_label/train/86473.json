{"id":86473,"title":"Large pleural effusions causing cardiac tamponade: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Hemodynamically significant cardiac tamponade physiology is an uncommon complication of a large pleural effusion. Previous reports have shown that this physiology can be reversed with thoracentesis. We describe a case of a 69-year-old man with multiple cardiac risk factors presenting with decompensated congestive heart failure and unstable angina. A coronary stent was placed in the left anterior descending artery. Two days postprocedure, he became unresponsive and hemodynamically unstable. A chest x-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral large-sized pleural effusions with transthoracic echocardiography demonstrating a small pericardial effusion, large right pleural effusion, and evidence of cardiac tamponade. A right thoracentesis was performed, draining almost 1,000ml of fluid and resulting in a rapid improvement of his hemodynamic profile.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772831","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac tamponade","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_tamponade"},{"name":"Thoracentesis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracentesis"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Pericardial effusion","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardial_effusion"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Coronary stent","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_stent"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.647471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.631796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.494868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.455666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interventricular_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.288404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.274266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.114781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Unstable angina","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstable_angina"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
