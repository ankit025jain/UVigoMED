{"id":83895,"title":"[Assay of adiponectin, leptin, true insulin and ghrelin levels in preterm human milk, and its relationship with infants growth].","abstract":"To understand adiponectin, leptin, insulin and ghrelin levels in preterm colostrum and mature milk and their influence on the growth and development of the premature infant.The study subjects were divided into two groups: preterm group and control group. Specimens of colostrum and mature milk on 42nd day after delivery were collected, the general situation of maternal and infants growth parameters at birth and at postnatal 42 days were recorded. Leptin, adiponectin, insulin and ghrelin levels in colustrum and mature milk were determined and compared.A total of 128 mother-infant pairs were involved. There were 128 specimens of colostrums (80 from preterm group, 48 from control group) and 94 specimens of mature milk(50 from premature group, 44 from control group). The levels of colostrum, mature milk adiponectin, leptin, and insulin were not significantly different between the 2 groups; ghrelin levels in colostrum and mature milk of premature group were significantly lower than those in control group (P = 0.038), adiponectin and leptin levels in colostrum were higher than those of the mature milk (P < 0.05), colostrum ghrelin levels were lower than those of mature milk (P < 0.05). Adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin showed no significant difference between different gestational age groups ( ? 34 weeks group vs. > 34 weeks group). True insulin level of mature milk in 34 weeks group was higher than that of > 34 weeks group (29.3 vs. 21.6 mU/L, P = 0.045); true insulin level in colostrums in ? 34 weeks group was lower than that in mature milk (21.7 vs. 29.3 mU/L, P = 0.000). Adiponectin levels in colostrum and 42 days weight gain were negatively correlated (r = -0.362, P = 0.025) . Insulin level in mature milk had a negative correlation with birth weight (r = -0.319, P = 0.029) . Ghrelin levels in colostrum and birth weight, length, head circumference, head circumference on 42(nd) day were positively correlated (r = 0.271,0.261,0.360, P < 0.05); weight, length at 42(nd) day and ghrelin levels showed borderline positive correlation (P = 0.050, 0.058).Many bioactive hormones in milk might participate in the regulation of suitable growth after birth. Premature birth affects hormone levels in breast milk. Breast feeding is very important in preterm infants.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25224056","annotations":[{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.871282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Colostrum","weight":0.835569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostrum"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.746633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Human breast milk","weight":0.712613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_breast_milk"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.62554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.548814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Bovine somatotropin","weight":0.460845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_somatotropin"},{"name":"Ghrelin","weight":0.4,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.186224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
