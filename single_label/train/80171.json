{"id":80171,"title":"[Treatment of scabies and Ascabiol(®) supply disruption: what about the pediatric population?].","abstract":"Scabies is a disease in steady increase in Île-de-France region. Standard treatment, Ascabiol(®) (benzyl benzoate/sulfiram), is back-order for several months and its return remains uncertain. Facing this drug shortage, French Drug Agency (ANSM) has imported a drug from Germany, Antiscabiosum 10 % (benzyl benzoate), to treat patients having contraindications for other scabicides available in France (ivermectin, esdepallethrine). However, infants less than 1 year (<15 kg) and asthmatics infants have no alternative treatment. A multidisciplinary workgroup explored the various existing therapeutic alternatives in France and worldwide. From ANSM's recommendations and group's experience, a decision algorithm was proposed for treating patients. However, pediatric context implied the use of off-label drugs. Proposed treatments widely known by practitioners, prescriptions-types, dose, modalities of use and dispensation, and flyers to patients were realized to optimize treatment efficacy.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768069","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"France","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.512277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.401326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.370282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.199711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Scabies","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabies"},{"name":"Benzoic acid","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoic_acid"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Ivermectin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin"},{"name":"Benzyl benzoate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzyl_benzoate"},{"name":"Benzyl","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzyl"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Flyer (pamphlet)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyer_(pamphlet)"},{"name":"Dispensation (Catholic Church)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensation_(Catholic_Church)"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
