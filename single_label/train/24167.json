{"id":24167,"title":"The ATTAIN trials: efficacy and safety of telavancin compared with vancomycin for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.","abstract":"Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) is the second most common nosocomial infection in the USA and the leading cause of mortality among hospital-acquired infections. An increasing proportion of HABP cases are the result of infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Telavancin is a once-daily injectable, semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial with bactericidal activity against susceptible Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA. The two methodologically identical Phase III ATTAIN studies demonstrated that telavancin was noninferior to vancomycin for the treatment of HABP, including ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, due to S. aureus (including methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and MRSA). Telavancin showed a similar safety profile to vancomycin, except that in patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment, there was increased mortality, which warrants caution when using telavancin in this population. Now approved in the USA for the treatment of HABP, including ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, caused by susceptible isolates of S. aureus when other alternatives are not suitable, telavancin offers another therapeutic option.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450506","annotations":[{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Telavancin","weight":0.904414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telavancin"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.878577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Glycopeptide antibiotic","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycopeptide_antibiotic"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.789093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Bacterial pneumonia","weight":0.653495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_pneumonia"},{"name":"Semisynthesis","weight":0.494927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semisynthesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.364312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.302581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
