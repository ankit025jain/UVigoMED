{"id":56773,"title":"Morphologic characteristics of macular complications of a dome-shaped macula determined by swept-source optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"To investigate the morphologic characteristics of macular complications of dome-shaped maculas using swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT).Retrospective observational case series.Axial length measurements and swept-source OCT were performed in 49 highly myopic eyes (in 5 male and 30 female subjects) with dome-shaped maculas. We classified the dome patterns and measured the central retinal thickness, central choroidal thickness, central scleral thickness, and the macular bulge height, and assessed the associations of these parameters with macular complications.The central scleral thickness was significantly negatively correlated with age and the axial length. We classified the eyes into 3 groups: 6 with choroidal neovascularization (CNV group), 8 with retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED group; 5 with serous retinal detachment), and 35 with no complications (no complications group). Nine eyes had a round dome and 40 had horizontally oriented oval-shaped domes. There were no significant differences in the frequency of macular complications between these patterns. The CNV group was significantly older and had a longer axial length than the other groups. The PED group had significantly larger values for both the central scleral thickness and bulge height than the other groups. The central choroidal thickness was significantly thinner in the CNV group than in the no complications group.A dome-shaped macula results from relative thickening of the macular sclera, and this may lead to PED. Thinning of the sclera owing to long-term changes and elongation of the axis may develop CNV and cause visual impairment.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Eye
