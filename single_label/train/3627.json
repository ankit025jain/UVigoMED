{"id":3627,"title":"Introduction of an 8-aminooctanoic acid linker enhances uptake of 99mTc-labeled lactam bridge-cyclized ?-MSH peptide in melanoma.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of amino acid, hydrocarbon, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers on the melanoma targeting and imaging properties of (99m)Tc-labeled lactam bridge-cyclized HYNIC-linker-Nle-CycMSHhex (hydrazinonicotinamide-linker-Nle-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-CONH2) peptides.Four novel peptides (HYNIC-GGGNle-CycMSHhex, HYNIC-GSGNle-CycMSHhex, HYNIC-PEG2Nle-CycMSHhex, and HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex) were designed and synthesized. The melanocortin-1 receptor binding affinities of the peptides were determined in B16/F1 melanoma cells. The biodistribution of (99m)Tc(ethylenediaminediacetic acid [EDDA])-HYNIC-GGGNle-CycMSHhex, (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-GSGNle-CycMSHhex, (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-PEG2Nle-CycMSHhex, and (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex were determined in B16/F1 melanoma-bearing C57 mice at 2 h after injection to select a lead peptide for further evaluation. The melanoma targeting and imaging properties of (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex were further examined because of its high melanoma uptake.The inhibitory concentrations of 50% (IC50) for HYNIC-GGGNle-CycMSHhex, HYNIC-GSGNle-CycMSHhex, HYNIC-PEG2Nle-CycMSHhex, and HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex were 0.7 ± 0.1, 0.8 ± 0.09, 0.4 ± 0.08, and 0.3 ± 0.06 nM, respectively, in B16/F1 melanoma cells. Among these four (99m)Tc-labeled peptides, (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex displayed the highest melanoma uptake (22.3 ± 1.72 percentage injected dose/g) at 2 h after injection. (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex exhibited high tumor-to-normal-organ uptake ratios except for the kidneys. The tumor-to-kidney uptake ratios of (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex were 3.29, 3.63, and 6.78 at 2, 4, and 24 h, respectively, after injection. The melanoma lesions were clearly visualized by SPECT/CT using (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex as an imaging probe at 2 h after injection.High melanoma uptake and fast urinary clearance of (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex highlighted its potential for metastatic melanoma detection in the future.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453052","annotations":[{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.773774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.590524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.561903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.536657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.505942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.482132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.469578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.350489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.273265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Melanocortin","weight":0.0804046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Lactam","weight":0.0225798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"},{"name":"Melanocyte-stimulating hormone","weight":0.0215179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"}]}
