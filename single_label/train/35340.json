{"id":35340,"title":"MRI and MR angiography findings to differentiate jugular venous reflux from cavernous dural arteriovenous fistula.","abstract":"Both jugular venous reflux (JVR) and cavernous dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) manifest as abnormal venous signal intensities on time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography (MRA). We investigated brain MRI and MRA findings that might differentiate JVR from cavernous DAVF.Forty-one patients with abnormal venous signal intensities on TOF MRA in the cavernous sinus and its vicinity were selected from 1508 patients who had undergone TOF MRA over the previous 6 months. For comparison, the examinations of 26 patients with cavernous DAVF who had undergone imaging over the previous 8 years were collected. The following findings were assessed: the side and location of abnormal venous signal intensities on intracranial TOF MRA; the signal intensity of the proximal jugular vein on T2-weighted imaging; whether there was early opacification of the cavernous sinus in the arterial phase of contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA); the side of jugular venous drainage in the arteriovenous phase of CE-MRA; and whether retrograde jugular venous flow was seen on neck TOF MRA.Abnormal venous signal intensities were seen on the left side in 73% of patients with JVR and 58% of patients with cavernous DAVF; involvement of the cavernous sinus was found in 12% of patients with JVR and 100% of patients with cavernous DAVF. Increased signal intensity in the ipsilateral jugular vein on T2-weighted imaging was found in 73% of JVR patients and 4% of cavernous DAVF patients. Early opacification of the cavernous sinus in the arterial phase of CE-MRA, ipsilateral jugular venous drainage in the arteriovenous phase of CE-MRA, and ipsilateral retrograde jugular venous flow on neck TOF MRA were found in 0%, 0%, and 63%, respectively, of JVR patients and in 100%, 100%, and 0%, respectively, of cavernous DAVF patients.JVR and cavernous DAVF can be differentiated from one another using MRI and MRA.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660714","annotations":[{"name":"Cavernous sinus","weight":0.861348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus"},{"name":"Arteriovenous fistula","weight":0.807151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_fistula"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.769557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Dura mater","weight":0.744587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.731015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.657392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.610903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.580328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.426469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Sinus (anatomy)","weight":0.295829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"1508","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1508"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Time-of-flight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"}]}
