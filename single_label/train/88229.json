{"id":88229,"title":"Pulmonary patch repair of tracheobronchial necrosis with perforation secondary to causticÂ ingestion.","abstract":"Corrosive aerodigestive injury complicated by tracheobronchial necrosis is a rare complication after caustic ingestion that carries a high risk of mortality and morbidity. If left untreated, tracheobronchial necrosis results in perforation, mediastinitis, and death. Pulmonary patch repair is a safe, effective, and easily performed surgical technique for the treatment of tracheobronchial necrosis with perforation. Frequent endoscopic surveillance leads to early diagnosis and prompt operative management to prevent significant morbidity. We describe a pulmonary patch repair of a patient who had stage 3b necrosis of the esophagus and the stomach with tracheobronchial necrosis and perforation after caustic ingestion.
