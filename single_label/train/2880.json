{"id":2880,"title":"[Corneal intrastromal Myoring implantation in keratoconus].","abstract":"The review discusses literature data on the treatment of keratoconus with intrastromal Myoring implantation into a corneal pocket, formed with a Pocket Maker microkeratome and a femtosecond laser alone and in combination with cross-linking of corneal collagen. The method shows high effectiveness as to refractive and functional outcomes and stabilization of keratoconus over the whole follow-up period (more than 3 years).","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306735","annotations":[{"name":"Laser","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.572261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.54191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.194444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.114624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Microkeratome","weight":0.0961346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkeratome"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.0558118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"}]}
