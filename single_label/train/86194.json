{"id":86194,"title":"The overexpression of 14-3-3? and Hsp27 promotes non–small cell lung cancer progression.","abstract":"The 14-3-3? protein has been identified as a putative oncoprotein in several cancers, including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms underlying its functions have not been well defined.Proteins that interact with 14-3-3? were identified through coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry in NSCLC cells. The interaction of 14-3-3? with these molecular partners and their roles in the invasiveness and metastasis of NSCLC cells were assayed through specific disruptions in the 14-3-3? signaling network. In addition, the clinical implications of this 14-3-3? complex were examined in samples from patients with NSCLC.Among the identified proteins that interacted with 14-3-3?, there were 230 proteins in 95-D cells, 181 proteins in 95-C cells, and 203 proteins in A549 cells; and 16 interacting proteins were identified that overlapped between all cell lines. Further studies revealed 14-3-3? complexes within the heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) protein and demonstrated that the interference of Hsp27 or 14-3-3? inhibited the invasion and metastasis of NSCLC cells. The invasive and metastatic capabilities of cells with both Hsp27 and 14-3-3? interference could be completely restored only by Hsp27 and 14-3-3? complementary DNA transfection and not by either agent alone. Clinically, the postoperative 5-year overall survival (OS) in patients who had high expression of both 14-3-3? and Hsp27 was significantly lower than the 5-year OS in patients who had low expression of both 14-3-3? and Hsp27 (26.5% vs 59.7%, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that the combined expression of 14-3-3? and Hsp27 was an independent prognostic indicator of OS(P = .036).The current data suggest that the combined expression of 14-3-3? and Hsp27 may be a biomarker for predicting survival in patients with NSCLC, and this combination may have potential as a therapeutic target for NSCLC.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804299","annotations":[{"name":"Heat shock
