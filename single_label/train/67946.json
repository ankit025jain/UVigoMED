{"id":67946,"title":"Influence of single hemodialysis session on serum paraoxonase-1, arylesterase activity, total ox?dant status and total antioxidant status.","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease(CKD) and hemodialysis (HD) are associated with increased oxidative stress. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most important cause of mortality in these patients. Increased cardiovascular risk is associated with oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the duration of single session hemodialysis may affect oxidative stress parameters on the patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) as oxidative markers and total antioxidant status (TAOS), paraoxonase1 (PON1) and arylesterase (ARES) as antioxidant markers were compared hemodialysis therapy before and after the treatment.TOS levels before hemodialysis were found as 4.4±2.4 ?mol H2O2 Equiv/L, TAOS 2.1±0.3 µmol trolox Equiv./L, OSI 0.2±0.1%, PON1 levels 58.5±35.6 U/L and ARES levels 22±0.2 U/L while after the HD the respective values were 1.4±1.2 ?mol H2O2 Equiv/L, 1.4±0.5 µmol trolox Equiv./L, 0.1±0.1%, 54.3±31.3 U/L, 21.8±0.1 U/L. A significant decreasing was observed in TOS TAOS OSI and ARES values before the HD compared to after the HD (P=0.0001, P=0.0001, P=0.0001, P=0.031, respectively).This study shows oxidant (TOS, OSI) and antioxidant (TAOS, ARES) markers were found to be significantly decrease after the HD compared to pre-hemodialysis. Although reverse is expected it is found that oxidants (indirectly ROS) did not increase and antioxidant reserve decreased in HD.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572453","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.863687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.774734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.771442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.73612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.712152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.707618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.661557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.652211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Oxidizing agent","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PON1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PON1"},{"name":"Paraoxonase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraoxonase"},{"name":"Trolox","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolox"},{"name":"331","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/331"},{"name":"535","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/535"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Passive optical network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Atari TOS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_TOS"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Amateur Radio Emergency Service","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Radio_Emergency_Service"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
