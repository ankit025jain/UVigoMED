{"id":62160,"title":"In Brief: (mis)splicing in disease.","abstract":"Splicing of pre-mRNAs is a crucial step in the gene expression pathway. Disruption of splicing has been linked to the pathogenesis of several human diseases and is particularly widespread in cancer. Recently, a number of mutations affecting genes of the core spliceosome machinery have been identified in haematological malignancies, yet the effect of such mutations on RNA splicing is unclear. A better understanding of how mis-splicing contributes to malignancies may provide diagnostic or prognostic information and new drug targets for therapeutic approaches.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615176","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.737917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.728037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.589221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Spliceosome","weight":0.554984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spliceosome"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.364652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
