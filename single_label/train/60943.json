{"id":60943,"title":"Acute coagulopathy in a porcine venous hemorrhage and ischemia reperfusion model.","abstract":"Injury-related coagulopathy is a complex process. We analyzed coagulation in a swine model of shock using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM).Forty-eight swine underwent laparotomy, 35% hemorrhage, supraceliac aortic cross-clamp, then reperfusion and resuscitation. ROTEM measurements and standard labs were taken at baseline and 6 hours into resuscitation.Clot formation time (98 vs 53 seconds, P = .001) and international normalized ratio (1.67 vs 1.01, P < .001) were prolonged after resuscitation. Maximum clot firmness (61 vs 72 mm, P < .001) and fibrinogen levels (94 vs 165, P < .001) declined significantly during resuscitation. Despite decreased fibrinogen levels, there was no significant increase in fibrinolysis as measured by maximum lysis (3.9% vs 3.8%, P = .99).ROTEM demonstrated the development of an acute coagulopathy. The most significant impacts on coagulopathy were seen with clot initiation and fibrin polymerization. Clot strength decreased over time, although there was little impact on clot breakdown because of fibrinolysis.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791624","annotations":[{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.889499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.570683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.532642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.510748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.502232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Polymerization","weight":0.342038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization"},{"name":"Thromboelastometry","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboelastometry"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Rotem (agriculture)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotem_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Suidae","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suidae"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Clot (Barcelona Metro)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clot_(Barcelona_Metro)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
