{"id":59378,"title":"Perinatal neuroblastoma: a hidden bullet in the chest.","abstract":"A neonate with antenatally diagnosed intrathoracic mass by ultrasound scan was delivered uneventfully at 35 weeks gestation by caesarean section due to pre-eclampsia and fluctuating hypertension in the mother. The intrathoracic mass was echogenic and the diagnosis was inconclusive. At 12 h of life the baby deteriorated acutely, in terms of increased oxygen requirement, ventilatory care, heart rate fluctuation, hypotension requiring inotropic support and died despite intensive care support. The parents were counselled that an autopsy would be invaluable in providing a diagnosis given the antenatal finding of an intrathoracic mass. The final diagnosis of neuroblastoma was performed at postmortem.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827646","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.88969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.828979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.789375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.52768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Inotrope","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotrope"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.456219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.428894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Bullet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"}]}
