{"id":36616,"title":"[Radiosurgical irradiation of patients with cerebral AVM on the Gamma knife].","abstract":"Arterio-venous malformation (AVM) of the brain are congenital malformations of cerebral vessels in the embryonic period. Standards in AVM treatment is currently applying the endovascular technique, microneurosurgical removal and stereotactic radiation.In the period from 2005 to 2011, in 139 patients with arteriovenous malformations of the brain were treated using \"Gamma Knife\". 89 (64%) of 139 patients suffered bleeding in anamnesis. Paroxysmal symptoms of varying severity dominated in the clinical picture of 35 (27%) patients. Previous microsurgical resection was performed in 10 patients. 28 patients experienced a partial embolization of vascular malformations before radiosurgery. A boundary value radiation dose ranged from 18 to 28 Gy (mean dose 20 Gy), day dose was in the range of 40-80% (average 50% isodose). Maximum dose ranged between 18-60 Gy (mean dose of 38 Gy.).Control angiography or spiral CT screening angiography was performed in all 85 patients who were treated with follow-up data for more than two years, showed that total obliteration occurred in 75% of cases. Frequency of symptomatic radiation reactions was less than 5%. After two years or more after treatment, complete obliteration was observed in 74% of patients.Higher frequency of AVM obliteration was seen with up to 2 cc. and the irradiation dose of at least 24 Gy.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564082","annotations":[{"name":"Gamma Knife","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Knife"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.909087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.880598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Radiosurgery","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.647631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.646707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.629579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.602375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.516873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.42302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Spiral computed tomography","weight":0.263219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.173608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Knife","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife"},{"name":"Cubic centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre"},{"name":"Human embryogenesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_embryogenesis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
