{"id":43562,"title":"The influence of FDG PET-CT on the detection of extrahepatic disease in patients being considered for resection of colorectal liver metastasis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (FDG PET-CT), as an adjunct to conventional CT staging, in the detection of extrahepatic disease in patients with potentially resectable colorectal liver metastasis.Overall, 133 consecutive patients with colorectal liver metastases staged with CT and PET-CT referred to the East Lancashire regional hepatobiliary multidisciplinary team over a two-year period were included in this study. Abnormal findings on PET-CT were correlated with follow-up imaging and/or histology. All imaging was reviewed by specialist hepatobiliary radiologists for the presence/absence of extrahepatic disease. The influence of the PET-CT findings was categorised for each patient in relation to operability and other significant findings.PET-CT had a major impact on staging of extra hepatic disease in 20% of patients, in comparison with the initial CT. Six per cent of patients were upstaged from operable CT findings to inoperable findings on PET-CT because of the discovery of inoperable occult extrahepatic disease. Five per cent had operable local regional nodal disease detected on PET-CT. A further 3% had premalignant colorectal lesions detected on PET-CT. Six per cent of patients were downstaged from indeterminate or suspected inoperable CT findings to operable findings on PET-CT.The use of PET-CT in this setting may prevent futile operations, guide the resection of local regional nodal disease and downstage a number of patients thought to have extrahepatic disease on conventional imaging. This study has shown similar results to other recent studies and supports the use of PET-CT as a necessary staging modality in patients with potentially resectable colorectal liver metastases.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780786","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.636336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.581834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.451825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.340943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Operability","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operability"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Occultism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultism"},{"name":"Lancashire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Lviv Oblast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_Oblast"},{"name":"Blocking (stage)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(stage)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatobiliary system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatobiliary_system"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Node (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(physics)"}]}
