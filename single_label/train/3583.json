{"id":3583,"title":"[Study on action mechanism of adjuvant therapeutic effect compound Ejiao slurry in treating cancers based on network pharmacology].","abstract":"Recently, compound Ejiao slurry (FFEJJ) had been applied to treat cancer patients in clinic, with obvious curative effect. In this study, data and literatures were collected from the TCM chemical component database to establish the chemical component database of FFEJJ. Afterwards, MetaDrug software was used to predict the targets of FFEJJ and obtain the compound-target network. Next, the compound-target network was compared and analyzed to obtain the \"compound-target-tumor target\" heterogeneous network. Besides, further analysis was made on gene functions and metabolic pathway. The results indicated that FFEJJ could directly resist tumors by regulating cancer cell differentiation, growth, proliferation and apoptosis, and show an adjuvant therapeutic effect by enriching the blood and increasing the immunity.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509304","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.884636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.758836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.731971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.554556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.552249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.419377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.395618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.274121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.15035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.100502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Slurry","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry"}]}
