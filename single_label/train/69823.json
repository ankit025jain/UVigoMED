{"id":69823,"title":"Targeting CHK1 inhibits cell proliferation in FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"CHK1 Ser/Thr kinase, a well characterized regulator of DNA damage response, is also involved in normal cell cycle progression. In this study, we investigate how CHK1 participates to proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing the mutated FLT3-ITD tyrosine kinase receptor. Pharmacological inhibition of CHK1 as well as its shRNA mediated down regulation reduced the proliferation rate of FLT-ITD expressing leukemic cell lines in a cytostatic manner. Flow cytometry analysis revealed no accumulation in a specific phase of the cell cycle upon CHK1 inhibition. Accordingly, lentiviral-mediated CHK1 overexpression increased the proliferation rate of FLT3-ITD expressing cells, as judged by cell viability and [3H] thymidine incorporation experiments. By contrast, expression of a ser280 mutant did not, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is an important determinant of CHK1 proliferative function. Clonogenic growth of primary leukemic cells from patients in semi-solid medium was reduced upon CHK1 inhibition, confirming the data obtained with leukemic established cell lines. Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 CHK1 inhibitory compounds tested in this study were also potent inhibitors of the FLT3-ITD tyrosine kinase receptor. Altogether, these data identify CHK1 as a regulator of FLT3-ITD-positive leukemic cells proliferation, and they open interesting perspectives in terms of new therapeutic strategies for these pathologies.
