{"id":56382,"title":"Improvement in specific function-related quality-of-life concerns after strabismus surgery in nondiplopic adults.","abstract":"We have previously reported improvement in psychosocial scores after strabismus surgery on the patient-derived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) Adult Strabismus 20 (AS-20) questionnaire in adults with nondiplopic strabismus. Unexpectedly, we also found improvement in the function domain. The aim of the present study was to identify which specific aspects of function-related quality of life improved postoperatively.We retrospectively identified non diplopic adult patients with a history of childhood onset strabismus who underwent surgery and who had preoperative and 1-year postoperative AS-20 questionnaires (scored from 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). Change in scores for each item was evaluated using signed-rank tests.A total of 20 patients were included. Of the 10 function-related AS-20 items, 9 showed significant mean improvement postoperatively (improvement ranged from 12.5 to 32.5 points, all P < 0.05). Rasch-derived mean scores improved in both reading function and general function domains (71.0 to 86.5 and 66.4 to 87.5, respectively; both P < 0.0001). Specific areas of function-related benefit were concentration, depth perception, hobbies, strain, reading, stress, and worry.We found specific function-related quality of life benefits after strabismus surgery in nondiplopic adult patients, particularly those with childhood onset strabismus.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698603","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.2695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.240104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Depth perception","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception"},{"name":"Domain of a function","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0224886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Hobby","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Strabismus surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus_surgery"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
