{"id":55917,"title":"External dacryocystorhinostomy with and without suturing the posterior mucosal flaps.","abstract":"To evaluate the outcome of the external dacryocystorhinostomy with and without suturing the posterior mucosal flaps.This study included 106 patients with lacrimal drainage system disorders who underwent the external dacryocystorhinostomy. Fifty four patients (Group A) underwent external dacryocystorhinostomy with suturing anterior and posterior flaps of the lacrimal sac and nasal mucosa, and the results obtained were compared with those of another series of 52 patients (Group B) where dacryocystorhinostomy was performed with suturing only the anterior flaps, whereas posterior mucosal flaps were excised.The success rate was evaluated by lacrimal patency to irrigation and relief of epiphora. Patency achieved in groups A and B was 94.4% and 96.2%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in success rate between the groups.Our study suggests that external dacryocystorhinostomy with suturing anterior and posterior flaps have no advantage over dacryocystorhinostomy with suturing only anterior flaps. Anastomosis by suturing only anterior flaps and excision of the posterior flaps is easier to perform and may improve the success rate of external dacryocystorhinostomy.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783915","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.693781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.642636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.393939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.34725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.324431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Epiphora (medicine)","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphora_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.105308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Lacrimal sac","weight":0.103079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_sac"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Dacryocystorhinostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacryocystorhinostomy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Sewage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Lacrimal bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_bone"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"}]}
