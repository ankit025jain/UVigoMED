{"id":88323,"title":"Nerve conduits for peripheral nerve surgery.","abstract":"Autologous nerve grafts are the current criterion standard for repair of peripheral nerve injuries when the transected nerve ends are not amenable to primary end-to-end tensionless neurorrhaphy. However, donor-site morbidities such as neuroma formation and permanent loss of function have led to tremendous interest in developing an alternative to this technique. Artificial nerve conduits have therefore emerged as an alternative to autologous nerve grafting for the repair of short peripheral nerve defects of less than 30 mm; however, they do not yet surpass autologous nerve grafts clinically. A thorough understanding of the complex biological reactions that take place during peripheral nerve regeneration will allow researchers to develop a nerve conduit with physical and biological properties similar to those of an autologous nerve graft that supports regeneration over long nerve gaps and in large-diameter nerves. In this article, the authors assess the currently available nerve conduits, summarize research in the field of developing these conduits, and establish areas within this field in which further research would prove most beneficial.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867724","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.711024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.311648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.309099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Neuroregeneration","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroregeneration"},{"name":"Neuroma","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroma"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.150106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Amenable group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenable_group"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"30 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Lost episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_episode"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0138715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"}]}
