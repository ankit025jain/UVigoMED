{"id":17894,"title":"Beyond the intensive care unit bundle: Implementation of a successful hospital-wide initiative to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections.","abstract":"A multimodal hospital-wide central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) risk reduction strategy was implemented over a 20-month period at an Australian center. Reduced CLABSI rates were observed in both intensive care units (ICUs) (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.39; P < .001) and non-ICU wards (IRR, 0.54; P < .001). The median time to CLABSI onset was 7.5 days for ICU events and 13 days for non-ICU events. The timing of infection demonstrates the need for more careful attention to postinsertion care and access of central venous catheters.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837122","annotations":[{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.820814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.805055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.674364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.623769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.552214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.394432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Reduction strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_strategy"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
