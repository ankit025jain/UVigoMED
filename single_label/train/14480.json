{"id":14480,"title":"Cardioprotective effect of rhizomes of Acorus gramineus against isoproterenol-induced cardiac damage in pigs.","abstract":"The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of water extract of rhizomes of Acorus gramineus (AGR) against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction. Male pigs were orally administered with 250 or 500 mg/kg of AGR or with vehicle for 9 days, with concurrent subcutaneous injections of ISO on the 8th and 9th day. Administration of AGR significantly ameliorated ISO-induced cardiac dysfunctions as evidenced by the ventricular ST-segment interval and R-amplitude as well as the left ventricle fractional shortening and ejection fraction. Additionally, administration of AGR significantly attenuated increased cardiac injury markers, such as cardiac troponin T, tumor necrosis factor-?, and myeloperoxidase activity, and cardiac marker enzymes, and prevented the depletion of antioxidant parameters. Malondialdehyde formation was also inhibited by AGR. Based on the results, it is concluded that AGR possesses significant cardioprotective potential and may serve as an adjunct in the treatment and prophylaxis of myocardial infarction.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24420420","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.920564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Cardiac marker","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_marker"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.789566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.622587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.573067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.399636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Isoprenaline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprenaline"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Troponin T","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin_T"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Advanced gas-cooled reactor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_gas-cooled_reactor"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"International Organization for Standardization","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization"},{"name":"Acorus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorus"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Rhizome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
