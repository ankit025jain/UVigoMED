{"id":22346,"title":"Toward a new vaccine for pertussis.","abstract":"To overcome the limitations of the current pertussis vaccines, those of limited duration of action and failure to induce direct killing of Bordetella pertussis, a synthetic scheme was devised for preparing a conjugate vaccine composed of the Bordetella bronchiseptica core oligosaccharide with one terminal trisaccharide to aminooxylated BSA via their terminal ketodeoxyoctanate residues. Conjugate-induced antibodies, by a fraction of an estimated human dose injected into young outbred mice as a saline solution, were bactericidal against B. pertussis, and their titers correlated with their ELISA values. The carrier protein is planned to be genetically altered pertussis toxoid. Such conjugates are easy to prepare, stable, and should add both to the level and duration of immunity induced by current vaccine-induced pertussis antibodies and reduce the circulation of B. pertussis.
