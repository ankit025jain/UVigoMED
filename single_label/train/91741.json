{"id":91741,"title":"Ingested foreign bodies: do we need a specific approach when treating inmates?","abstract":"The management of foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract is not standardized. Foreign body ingestions in prisoners are always intentional and inmates can be manipulative, which makes medical decision even more difficult. Our objective is to propose a decisional algorithm for management of foreign body ingestion in prisoners. We reviewed the records of 198 admissions for foreign body ingestion for a 10-year period. Type and number of ingested foreign bodies, radiographic findings, outcome as well as the management method including conservative, endoscopic removal, or surgical treatment were analyzed. Most cases were managed conservatively (87.6%). Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract was performed in 37 cases with a success rate of 46 per cent. In 9.3 per cent of cases, the final treatment was endoscopic. Only five patients required surgical treatment, being emergent just in one case. We advocate conservative treatment for asymptomatic patients with foreign body ingestion. Endoscopic removal is proposed for pointed objects or objects bigger than 2.5 cm located in the stomach. Objects longer than 6 to 8 cm located in the stomach should be removed by endoscopy or laparoscopy. Patients with objects in the small bowel or colon should be treated conservatively unless there are complications or they fail to progress.
