{"id":17272,"title":"Efficiency and effectiveness of using nonmedical staff during an urgent mass prophylaxis response.","abstract":"Using a simulated anthrax scenario, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health tested the readiness of a nonmedical closed point-of-dispensing (POD) site to see how rapidly and accurately it could provide medication to its internal population. This closed POD had developed and exercised its mass prophylaxis plan in conjunction with the local health department twice before, and the department was interested in assessing the impact of having no onsite department involvement. Two sessions were conducted as part of the overall exercise. In session 1, agency staff ran POD operations with no department involvement. During session 2, department staff provided an hour-long training session and oversaw POD operations. Mean throughput and accuracy rates of the 2 sessions were then compared to a previous health department public POD exercise staffed by department personnel and medical volunteers. The closed POD would be able to process the entire internal population in an estimated mean time of 23.9 hours. The accuracy rates for dispensing the correct medication during session 1 was 84.7% and 92.4% during session 2 (p=0.0012). Overall accuracy was significantly higher in a previous local health department public POD exercise (88.6% vs. 96.9%, p < 0.0001), as was pediatric dosing accuracy (p < 0.0001). We concluded that nonmedical closed PODs are a valuable strategy during a public health emergency that requires large segments of a population to receive medication rapidly. They must be activated judiciously, however, as their use may increase adverse events and potentially result in discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis should people choose not to finish the course. Local health department training and oversight reduce errors but may not always be available.
