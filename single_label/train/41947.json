{"id":41947,"title":"MR imaging of benign focal liver lesions.","abstract":"Focal liver lesions (FLLs) are commonly encountered on routine imaging studies. Most lesions detected are benign, but many are indeterminate at the time of initial imaging. This article reviews the important role of MR imaging for the detection and characterization of various benign FLLs while illustrating typical imaging appearances and potential pitfalls in interpretation. The utility of diffusion-weighted imaging and hepatocyte-specific contrast agents is also discussed.
