{"id":37350,"title":"[Superior vena cava blood flow measurements for results prognosing of a bidirectional cava-pulmonary anastomosis in correction of hemodynamics parameters in patients with hypoplastic right ventricle].","abstract":"The method of prediction the enability of closure atrial septal defect before operation or in pre-bypass period during the one and one-half ventricle repair of CHD with hypoplastic right ventricle was presented. The method is based on comparison of the initial blood flow on superior vena cava (SVC) and right-to-left shunt at atrial level. Defect can be closed if flow on SVC and shunt flow are approximately equal. According to prognosis in 16 of 37 patients defect was closed. After operation there were not signes congestive heart insufficiensy and cyanosis. This approach allowes to avoid reoperations at least in half of patients. If shunt flow exceeds flow on SVC, defect must be left open.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501964","annotations":[{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.829848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.639178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.540539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.508618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.423912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.274546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Cardiac shunt","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_shunt"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Defection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defection"}]}
