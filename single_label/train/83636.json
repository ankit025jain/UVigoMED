{"id":83636,"title":"[The role of pro- and antioxidants of microorganisms in regulation of symbiosis homeostasis mechanisms (on the model of human vaginal biotope)].","abstract":"Study the production of bacterial pro- and antioxidants in vaginal biotope and analysis of their role in regulation of symbiosis homeostasis mechanisms.Hydrogen peroxide, catalase inhibitors and antioxidant production in bacteria isolated from 63 women with vaginal eubiosis and 53--with dysbiosis were studied. Production of pro- and antioxidants was regulated by lactate, volatile fatty acids, polyamines and Lactobacillus plantarum and Corynebacterium minutissimum polysaccharides, metabolite bactericidity of peroxide producing lactobacilli was enhanced by addition of iron (II) ions.A high level of pro- and antioxidant production was noted for eubiosis state, and their ratio was close to 1, for biotopes with dysbiosis a multiple predominance of microbial antioxidant levels over pro-oxidants was characteristic. Peroxide producing symbionts are an important component of system of generation of hydroxyl radicals that are highly effective wide specter disinfectants.Maintenance of balance of pro- and antioxidant production by symbionts determined vaginal biotope symbiosis homeostasis. The detected high biocidic activity of hydroxyl radicals that are formed from hydrogen peroxide of normoflora through the creation of optimal conditions for their generation by selection of the respective concentrations of iron (II) ions and H2O2 opens perspective of development of novel disinfection methods.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286506","annotations":[{"name":"Lactobacillus plantarum","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_plantarum"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Symbiosis","weight":0.802388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Hydroxyl radical","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.703577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Biocide","weight":0.691906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.652211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Polyamine","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamine"},{"name":"Volatility (chemistry)","weight":0.557844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Corynebacterium","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corynebacterium"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.42749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.210374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Biotope","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotope"},{"name":"Volatile fatty acids","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_fatty_acids"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Electricity generation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"},{"name":"Molecular cloud","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
