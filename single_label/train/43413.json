{"id":43413,"title":"Long-term oncologic outcomes of endoscopic stenting as a bridge to surgery for malignant colonic obstruction: comparison with emergency surgery.","abstract":"Self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) are now regarded as an effective and safe intervention for malignant colorectal obstruction (MCO). However, manipulation of the tumor might lead to the spillage of tumor cells and result in distant metastases. We aimed to compare the long-term oncologic outcomes of SEMS as a bridge to surgery with those of emergency surgery for MCO.Between June 2005 and December 2011, 60 patients who underwent elective curative resection after endoscopic SEMS insertion were included in the \"SEMS group\". The SEMS group was matched to 180 patients who underwent emergency curative surgery for MCO during the same period [\"Emergency surgery (ES) group\"]. The clinicopathologic characteristics, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups.There were no significant differences in demographics, tumor stage, location, and histology between the SEMS group and the ES group. The median follow-up times were 41.4 months (IQR, 22.2-60.0 months) for the SEMS group and 45.0 months (IQR, 20.9-68.1 months) for the ES group. The proportions of patients who received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were comparable (SEMS group vs. ES group, 68.3 % vs. 77.8 %; P = 0.210). The long-term prognosis did not significantly differ between two groups in either the 5-year RFS rate (79.6 % vs. 70.2 %; P = 0.218) or the 5-year OS rate (97.8 % vs. 94.3 %; P = 0.469).Long-term oncologic outcomes of SEMS insertion as a bridge to surgery were comparable to those of primary curative surgery.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789126","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.625994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.377582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Elective surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
