{"id":72557,"title":"The synergistic regulation of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis through miR-190 and target genes.","abstract":"VEGF is a major contributor to angiogenesis, a vital process in normal growth and development and tumor transition. However, the current clinical efficacy of VEGF inhibitors is limited, and the molecular mechanism underlying VEGF regulation remains to be elucidated. Here we show that miR-190 directly targets a group of angiogenic effectors besides VEGF per se. Noted, these effectors can transcriptionally regulate VEGF expression in an intracellular or intercellular manner, thus demonstrating that miR-190 modulates the VEGF-mediated tumor angiogenesis at three levels. The synergistic effect of miR-190 and its target genes demonstrates a complex but apparently more stable system, allowing for the tight control of the level of VEGF. Finally, we showed that miR-190 significantly suppresses tumor metastasis, especially angiogenesis. Together, these results indicate that miR-190 is a promising antitumor target in clinical applications.
