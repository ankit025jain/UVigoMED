{"id":33986,"title":"Cellular origins of auditory event-related potential deficits in Rett syndrome.","abstract":"Dysfunction in sensory information processing is a hallmark of many neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and Rett syndrome (RTT). Using mouse models of RTT, a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, we found that the large-scale loss of MeCP2 from forebrain GABAergic interneurons led to deficits in auditory event-related potentials and seizure manifestation, whereas the restoration of MeCP2 in specific classes of interneurons ameliorated these deficits.
