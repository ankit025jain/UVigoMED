{"id":37735,"title":"Increased arterial diameters in the posterior cerebral circulation in men with Fabry disease.","abstract":"A high load of white matter lesions and enlarged basilar arteries have been shown in selected patients with Fabry disease, a disorder associated with an increased stroke risk. We studied a large cohort of patients with Fabry disease to differentially investigate white matter lesion load and cerebral artery diameters. We retrospectively analyzed cranial magnetic resonance imaging scans of 87 consecutive Fabry patients, 20 patients with ischemic stroke, and 36 controls. We determined the white matter lesion load applying the Fazekas score on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences and measured the diameters of cerebral arteries on 3D-reconstructions of the time-of-flight-MR-angiography scans. Data of different Fabry patient subgroups (males-females; normal-impaired renal function) were compared with data of patients with stroke and controls. A history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks was present in 4/30 males (13%) and 5/57 (9%) females with Fabry disease, all in the anterior circulation. Only one man with Fabry disease showed confluent cerebral white matter lesions in the Fazekas score assessment (1%). Male Fabry patients had a larger basilar artery (p<0.01) and posterior cerebral artery diameter (p<0.05) compared to male controls. This was independent of disease severity as measured by renal function and did not lead to changes in arterial blood flow properties. A basilar artery diameter of >3.2 mm distinguished between men with Fabry disease and controls (sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 86%, p<0.001), but not from stroke patients. Enlarged arterial diameters of the posterior circulation are present only in men with Fabry disease independent of disease severity.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475221","annotations":[{"name":"Basilar artery","weight":0.916034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilar_artery"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.854759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.810634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.758551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.741133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.689819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.683758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Transient ischemic attack","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_ischemic_attack"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.664792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.616261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cerebral circulation","weight":0.557834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_circulation"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.429136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Posterior cerebral artery","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.111285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Fabry disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabry_disease"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
