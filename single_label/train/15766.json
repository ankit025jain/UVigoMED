{"id":15766,"title":"Salmonellosis in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was evaluation of epidemiological situation of salmonellosis in Poland in 2012 compared to the previous years.The main source of data for this study are statistical overviews contained in the annual bulletins \"Infectious Diseases in Poland in 2012\" (NIZP-PZH, GIS, Warsaw 2013), reports from investigations obtained from the sanitary epidemiological stations. Information on deaths due to infectious and parasitic diseases registered in Poland in 2012 and earlier years is based on the data from the Department for Demographic Research of Central Statistical Office. For the purpose of surveillance cases were classified according to the case definition.In Poland in 2012, it was reported a total of 8 444 cases of zoonotic salmonellosis including 8 267 cases of intestinal salmonellosis and 177 of extraintestinal one. The incidence was 21.9/100 000. The criteria for a confirmed case met more than 94% of cases. The number of reported cases was lower than in 2011, reflecting the continued downward trend in the number of cases of salmonellosis in Poland. A very high percentage (69.4%) hospitalizations of people infected with zoonotic Salmonella remains. In outbreaks proportion of hospitalizations accounted for one third of the cases. Predominated children under the age of 5 years. Seven people died of salmonellosis. In 2012, it was reported 181 outbreaks caused by Salmonella in which 1 511 people still. They were mostly small family outbreaks. The most common etiological agent of salmonellosis in Poland is S. enteritidis, but slightly increases the percentage cases, for which no serologic type was determined. In 2012 it stood at 14%. This proportion was highest in the Pomorskie province and amounted to 58%.Keeping up for more than 10 years in the percentage of salmonellosis hospitalization rate at 70%, indicates underreporting of the disease in the country and mostly detection of the cases requiring hospital treatment. Growing proportion of Salmonella that are not serotyped, reaching in some regions more than 30% indicates problems with laboratory diagnostics salmonellosis.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135508","annotations":[{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.805036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.710287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.55682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Warsaw","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.288178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Salmonellosis","weight":0.261645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonellosis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.107842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.0843352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Geographic information system","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"List of human parasitic diseases","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_parasitic_diseases"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
