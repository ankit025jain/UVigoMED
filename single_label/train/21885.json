{"id":21885,"title":"Reasons for hospitalization in Parkinson's disease: a case-control study.","abstract":"To characterize reasons for hospital admission, mortality and surgical procedures in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to controls.The clinical features of all consecutive patients from 2000 to 2007 were reviewed. We identified patients with PD (ICD 9 code 332.0) from a database of our General Hospital (Vimercate) with a catchment's population of 180,000. Data on admitting wards as well as reasons for admission, surgical procedures performed and clinical outcome were collected. Clinical data were compared to an age and sex matched control population admitted in the same period of time.The total number of admissions was 367. Mean age was 76.7 years. The mean duration of stay was 9.2 days for controls and 9.7 for PD patients. A comorbid disorder was the cause of admission in 80% of cases and 79% of cases came from the Emergency Room. Infectious diseases, mainly respiratory infections, were more frequent in PD of both sexes, while trauma was significantly higher only in PD men. Percentage of patients treated surgically was similar in both cases and controls. Intrahospital mortality was 6% both in PD and controls. Infectious diseases were more frequent in PD patients while cardiovascular death was more frequent in controls.Comorbidity in PD is higher than reported in other reports. In our study PD patients had the same length of hospitalization and intrahospital mortality as controls. The presence of a control population allows to discriminate between general complications of the elderly and specific vulnerabilities of PD patients.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582073","annotations":[{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.723736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.482132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0346536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Admission note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"}]}
