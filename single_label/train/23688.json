{"id":23688,"title":"Transmission of Clostridium difficile spores in isolation room environments and through hospital beds.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the dissemination of Clostridium difficile (CD) spores in a hospital setting where the potassium monopersulfate-based disinfectant Virkon™ was used for cleaning. In the initial part of the study, we sampled 16 areas of frequent patient contact in 10 patient rooms where a patient with CD infection (CDI) had been accommodated. In the second part of the study, we obtained samples from 10 patient beds after discharge of CDI patients, both before and after the beds were cleaned. In the first part, CDspores were isolated in only 30% of the rooms. In the second part, which focused on transmission to hospital beds, C. difficile was found in four of 10 beds either before or after cleaning. In conclusion, in both parts of the study, we demonstrated a moderate spread of CD spores to the environment despite routine cleaning procedures involving Virkon™.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475890","annotations":[{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.653216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.597707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.591559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Spore","weight":0.263398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.262707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Virkon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virkon"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Development_of_Indigenous_Peoples"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Dissemination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissemination"}]}
