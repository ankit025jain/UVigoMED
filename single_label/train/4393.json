Totally 61.29% of the cases had the scores over average for the overall QOL, but the scores for the health and well-being were lower. There were a significant difference among the average scores of different domains of QOL (?2 = 23.46, P < 0.01). Both the year of being diagnosed and clinical classification was not associated with the scores of QOL. Regularly taking physical activities was significantly associated with each of all the 4 domains. The factors such as onset of acute disease in 2 weeks, taking therapeutic pills daily, marital status, age, etc. impacted the specific domains of QOL. The overall QOL and the 4 domains of the patients were at medium level; meanwhile, the score of physiological domain was lower than the scores of the other 3 domains.The QOL(s) of advanced schistosomiasis patients in Qingpu District are relatively good. It is important to provide effective community health services and encourage the patients to take part in tempered sports or physical activities in order to keep their normal activities of daily living.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345159","annotations":[{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.668666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.619937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.470077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.284412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.267041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Marital status","weight":0.164972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_status"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.113019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Trans woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
