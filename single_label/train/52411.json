{"id":52411,"title":"Prevalence of breast cancer in thyroid diseases: results of a cross-sectional study of 3,921 patients.","abstract":"Results from national cancer registries reveal an association of thyroid cancers with extra-thyroidal malignancies. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of breast cancer (BC) in women affected by both benign and malignant thyroid diseases (TD) in comparison to the general population. To this end, 3,921 female patients from central and southern regions of Italy were evaluated. Age-matched analysis of the prevalence of BC was carried out after dividing the patients into three diagnostic categories: (1) 1,149 patients with non-nodular TD; (2) 2350 patients with nodular TD; (3) 422 patients affected by differentiated thyroid cancers. Furthermore, the patients were grouped according to the absence (2,344 patients) or presence (1,453 patients) of anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb) and/or anti-thyroperoxidase (TPOAb) or anti-TSH receptor auto-antibodies (124 patients). BC prevalence in TD patients as a whole was significantly higher compared to the general population, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.33. Age-matched analysis showed that the risk of a BC in TD patients was higher in younger patients (age 0-44 years), with an OR of 15.24, which decreased with increasing age. Patients without thyroid auto-antibodies showed a higher OR for BC (p = 0.0005) than TD patients with TgAb and/or TPOAb. The results demonstrate that women affected by either benign or malignant thyroid disease have a significantly greater risk of BC, which is higher at a younger age. Furthermore, thyroid auto-antibodies appear to be protective against BC. These findings may contribute to the identification of common genetic and environmental factors underlying this disease association.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604093","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.76079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.702871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.425714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.41327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nature versus nurture","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Southern Italy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy"},{"name":"921","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/921"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"344","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/344"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Regions of Italy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Italy"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Territorial Decoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Decoration"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Classification of mental disorders","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_mental_disorders"},{"name":"Minuscule 453","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_453"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"}]}
