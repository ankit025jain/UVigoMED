{"id":79164,"title":"[Role of Nods like receptors in the patients with nasal polyps].","abstract":"To investigate the expression and role of a new pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod) like receptors (NLRs), in the patients with nasal polyps and nasal septum normal control group.The expressions of Nod1, Nod2 and Nalp3 mRNA and protein were explored with real-time RT-PCR, Western-Blot and immunohistochemistry respectively.The protein levels of Nod1, Nod2 and Nalp3 were expressed in nasal polyp and the control, but the expression of Nod1 and Nalp3 in nasal polyps were higher than those in control. No significant difference of Nod2 was seen between the two groups. And then, there was no significant difference of Nod1, Nod2, Nalp3 mRNA between two groups with Real-time RT-PCR.The expression of Nod1 and Nalp3 are increased in nasal polyp tissues and maybe a etiological factors in the formation of nasal polyps.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479354","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.646976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.493301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Oligomer","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Nasal septum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Nasal polyp","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Brotherhood of Nod","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Nod"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Pennsylvania Railroad","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad"}]}
