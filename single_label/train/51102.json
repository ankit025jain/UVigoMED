{"id":51102,"title":"LADA and CARDS: a prospective study of clinical outcome in established adult-onset autoimmune diabetes.","abstract":"Diabetes-associated autoantibodies can be detected in adult-onset diabetes, even when initially non-insulin requiring, i.e., with latent autoimmune diabetes. We aimed to identify adult-onset autoimmune diabetes in patients with established \"type 2 diabetes\" participating in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) to characterize their phenotype and clinical outcome.We prospectively studied 2,425 European patients with presumed type 2 diabetes (mean age 62 years, diabetes duration 7.9 years) for outcomes at 3.9 years after randomization to either atorvastatin or placebo. Subjects were screened for autoantibodies to GAD (GADA), insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2A), and zinc-transporter 8 (ZnT8A).A total of 173 patients (7.1%) had GADA, of whom 11 (0.5%) and 5 (0.2%) were also positive for IA-2A and ZnT8A, respectively. At baseline, 44% of GADA-positive patients were not on insulin. Fewer autoantibody-positive than autoantibody-negative patients had metabolic syndrome (64 vs. 80%), and more were on insulin (56 vs. 17%) (P < 0.0001 for each) without lower HbA1c (69 mmol/mol [8.5%] vs. 62 mmol/mol [7.8%]). The frequency of microvascular and macrovascular events was similar in both cohorts, independent of atorvastatin.Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes was prevalent, even in patients with established diabetes presumed to have type 2 diabetes. After 11.8 years' diabetes duration, nearly half the patients with autoimmune diabetes were not on insulin treatment and almost two-thirds had metabolic syndrome. The type of diabetes, whether autoimmune diabetes or type 2 diabetes, did not impact the risk of microvascular disease.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722498","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.778993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Microangiopathy","weight":0.670524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microangiopathy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Atorvastatin","weight":0.532117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.529832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Latent autoimmune diabetes","weight":0.499004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes"},{"name":"Glutamate decarboxylase","weight":0.428393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_decarboxylase"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.354764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
