{"id":25483,"title":"RNA-binding proteins in heart development.","abstract":"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key players of posttranscriptional regulation occurring during normal tissue development. All tissues examined thus far have revealed the importance of RBPs in the regulation of complex networks involved in organ morphogenesis, maturation, and function. They are responsible for controlling tissue-specific gene expression by regulating alternative splicing, mRNA stability, translation, and poly-adenylation. The heart is the first organ form during embryonic development and is also the first to acquire functionality. Numerous remodeling processes take place during late cardiac development since fetal heart first adapts to birth and then undergoes a transition to adult functionality. This physiological remodeling involves transcriptional and posttranscriptional networks that are regulated by RBPs. Disruption of the normal regulatory networks has been shown to cause cardiomyopathy in humans and animal models. Here we review the complexity of late heart development and the current information regarding how RBPs control aspects of postnatal heart development. We also review how activities of RBPs are modulated adding complexity to the regulation of developmental networks.
