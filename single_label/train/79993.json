{"id":79993,"title":"Evaluation of faecal flotation methods followed by species-specific PCR for detection of Echinococcus multilocularis in the definitive hosts.","abstract":"Echinococcus multilocularis is one of the most pathogenic zoonotic parasites in the temperate and arctic region of the Northern Hemisphere. For estimating the potential risk of human infection in endemic areas, reliable antemortem methods are needed to detect the parasite in carnivore definitive hosts. The sensitivity of routine flotation techniques for detection of E. multilocularis eggs was found to be low (3-33%) depending on the flotation solution used (specific gravities = 1.3-1.4). An improved faecal flotation followed by a species-specific PCR is described with a sensitivity of 74% (95% CI = 62-84%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI = 94-100%). These parameters are similar to those of the intestinal scraping technique (sensitivity = 78%, specificity = 100%). The sensitivity of the improved flotation was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than that of routine flotation techniques. The costs of the method are similar or lower than those of other antemortem diagnostic methods. Based on these data, the method is suitable for surveys of domesticated and wild carnivores.
