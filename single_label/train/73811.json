{"id":73811,"title":"Outcome of bone defect reconstruction with clavicle bone cement prosthesis after tumor resection: a case series study.","abstract":"To investigate the short and medium term outcomes of bone defect reconstruction with bone cement prosthesis after clavicle malignancies resection.A total of 5 clavicular malignancy patients experienced bone cement prosthesis reconstruction after subtotal claviculectomy were enrolled the study from January 2005 to May 2012. Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score (MSTS), Visual Analogue scale (VAS) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder outcome score (ASES) were adopted for assessment.The mean follow-up period was 25.8 months. All patients were performed bone cement defect reconstruction after claviculectomy. In which, 3 cases showed disease-free and other 2 cases were alive with sickness. The average Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 85.40% ± 5.68%(77%-90%), Visual Analogue Scale was 1.40 ± 0.55 (1-2) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Outcome Score was 92.40 ± 3.29(87-96).Adoption of clavicle bone cement prosthesis for bone defect reconstruction after tumor resection can maintain the contour of shoulder and reduce the complications ascribe to the claviculectomy. It is an effective and feasible therapeutic procedure in clinical setting.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885109","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.604279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.527014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.361749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.277756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.223266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0884832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.0639325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.0269705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Military Sealift Command","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Sealift_Command"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
