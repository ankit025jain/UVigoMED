{"id":44432,"title":"[The combined endoscopic hemostasis in case of gastroduodenal ulcerative bleeding].","abstract":"It was done the retrospective analysis of the endoscopic hemostasis effectiveness in 207 patients with gastroduodenal bleeding in the period from November 2011 to April 2013. The differential approach to the choice of hemostasis methods and consistency of their application were developed. It was done the comparative analysis of two- and three-stages combined hemostasis results. The analysis included the infiltration of the submucosal layer by 0.01% solution of adrenaline, argon-plasma coagulation and hemostatic glue applique.
