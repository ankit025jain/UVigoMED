{"id":90245,"title":"Positive aspects of caregiving in Spanish caregivers of individuals with acquired brain injury.","abstract":"Taking care of a person with acquired brain injury (ABI) is often associated with symptoms of stress and psychological distress. However, caregiving can also be a source of satisfaction and can contribute toward an improvement in the quality of life both of the caregiver and the person with ABI. The aim of this study is to assess and adapt the Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale (PACS) to Spanish.The PACS was completed by a sample of 141 family members who are the primary caregivers of relatives with ABI (mean age = 58.3 years, SD = 12.2; 78% women). The caregivers also responded to questions evaluating quality of life, burden, and posttraumatic growth.The results confirm the original structure of the PACS, which consists of 2 correlated factors: Self-Affirmation and Outlook on Life. Furthermore, these factors demonstrated adequate indices for internal consistency. The scores obtained from the PACS are positively associated with quality of psychological life, quality of social life, and posttraumatic growth and negatively associated with the perception of burden.The results highlight how important it is for interventions to emphasize the positive aspects of caregiving in caregivers of people affected by ABI.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635012","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.874947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.79019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.32386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.315669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.255508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Health effects from noise","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Aspects (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_(band)"},{"name":"Application binary interface","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Picture archiving and communication system","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system"}]}
