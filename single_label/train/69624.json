{"id":69624,"title":"[Markers of prostate cancer stem cells: research advances].","abstract":"Prostate cancer is one of the most seriously malignant diseases threatening men's health, and the mechanisms of its initiation and progression are not yet completely understood. Recent years have witnessed distinct advances in researches on prostate cancer stem cells in many aspects using different sources of materials, such as human prostate cancer tissues, human prostate cancer cell lines, and mouse models of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer stem cell study offers a new insight into the mechanisms of the initiation and progression of prostate cancer and contributes positively to its treatment. This article presents an overview on the prostate cancer stem cell markers utilized in the isolation and identification of prostate cancer stem cells.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432630","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.339873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0546142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
