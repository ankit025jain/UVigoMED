{"id":81410,"title":"Minimally invasive clinical approach in indirect pulp therapy and healing of deep carious lesions.","abstract":"Indirect pulp treatment is a conservative vital pulp procedure performed in deep carious lesion approximating the pulp, but without signs or symptoms of pulp degeneration. Removing the carious biomass along with sealing the residual caries from extrinsic substrate and oral bacteria makes residual caries after the first excavation less active. This allows time for pulpo dentinal complex to form tertiary dentine so that at the second excavation, there is less likelihood of pulpal exposure. It has also been suggested that by changing the cavity environment from an active lesion into a more slowly progressing lesion, will be accompanied by more regular tubular tertiary dentin formation. The success of this approach has been demonstrated by various randomized controlled studies comparing conventional treatment of such lesions with stepwise excavation. These results are echoed at clinical, radiographic, macroscopic, microscopic and ultrastructural level during follow up visits. This study reviews promising concepts and rationale of minimally invasive indirect pulp therapy technique where conventional wisdom of caries removal is challenged","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095310","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.630577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.555683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.328847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.305564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.294073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Biomass","weight":0.246458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.212894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.208226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Excavation (archaeology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excavation_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Palenque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palenque"},{"name":"Conventional wisdom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_wisdom"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Seal hunting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Wisdom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"}]}
