{"id":67987,"title":"An update on occupation and prostate cancer.","abstract":"Our aim was to identify gaps and limitations in the current literature and to make recommendations for future research required to address these.We reviewed occupational exposures and related factors associated with the risk of prostate cancer between 2000 and 2012. These included chemical, ergonomic, physical or environmental, and psychosocial factors which have been reported by epidemiological studies across a range of industries.The results are inconsistent from study to study and generally this is due to the reliance upon the retrospectivity of case-control studies and prevalence (ecological) studies. Exposure assessment bias is a recurring limitation of many of the studies in this review.We consider there is insufficient evidence to implicate prostate cancer risk for ergonomic, physical, environmental or psychosocial factors, but there is sufficient evidence to implicate toxic metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). More research is required to identify specific pesticides that may be associated with risk of prostate cancer.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568454","annotations":[{"name":"Polychlorinated biphenyl","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.766594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Pesticide","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.713709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Organochloride","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organochloride"},{"name":"Toxic metal","weight":0.474015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_metal"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.356322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.291173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Exposure assessment","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_assessment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.22231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
