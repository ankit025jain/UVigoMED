{"id":87672,"title":"Epidemiologic study of young soccer player's injuries in U12 to U20.","abstract":"The aim of this study was an epidemiological report of the injuries to young soccer players from pretraining centres (12 to 15 years: U12-U15) and training centres (16 to 20 years: U16-U20).Over 3 years, 618 injuries were analysed, concerning an average of 137 players per season (66 and 71 players in U12-U15 and U16-U20, respectively). The injuries were diagnosed by a physician. Numerous injury-related information were documented: player, player's age category, date of the injury, site of the injury, injured side, type of injury, circumstances: training vs. match and contact vs non-contact, number of days of play missed, severity, and player's position.The injury rate was higher in matches than in training sessions. Non-contact injuries accounted for 77.0% of the injuries for U12-U15 and 65.6% for U16-U20. The injuries were mainly to the thigh and hip in pretraining players (23.3% and 19.0%, respectively), and to the thigh and ankle in training players (32.1% and 20.3%, respectively). Contact injuries occurred more frequently during matches, presumably because of the higher intensity of play. The analysis of match injuries by position indicated that for U12-U15, during the matches, lateral defenders were injured most often: 30.4%. For U16-U20, axial midfielders and axial defenders were most subject to injuries during the matches (26.6% and 23.1%, respectively).These results may help to improve the programming of training. Between the first and third seasons of this study, a decrease in injuries during both matches and training sessions: from 174 to 107 (decrease of 38.5%).","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034555","annotations":[{"name":"Association football","weight":0.59375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.471137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.319609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Midfielder","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"618","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/618"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Programming (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_(music)"},{"name":"Defender (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football)"},{"name":"Season (sports)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_(sports)"},{"name":"U12 minor spliceosomal RNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U12_minor_spliceosomal_RNA"},{"name":"England national under-16 football team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-16_football_team"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
