{"id":29904,"title":"A cognitive behavioral therapy-based text messaging intervention for methamphetamine dependence.","abstract":"Psychosocial treatments for methamphetamine dependence are of limited effectiveness. Thus, a significant need exists for add-on therapy for this substance user disorder. The aim of this study was to develop and test a novel text messaging intervention for use as an adjunct to cognitive behavioral group therapy for methamphetamine users. Text messaging has the potential to support patients in real-time, around the clock. We convened two meetings of an expert panel, held three focus groups in current and former users, and conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with in-treatment users in order to develop a fully automated, cognitive behavioral therapy-based text messaging intervention. We then conducted a randomized, crossover pre-test in five users seeking treatment. Participants' ratings of ease of use and functionality of the system were high. During the pre-test, we performed real-time assessments via text messaging on daily methamphetamine use, craving levels, and the perceived usefulness of messages; 79% of scheduled assessments were collected. The odds of messages being rated as \"very\" or \"extremely\" useful were 6.6 times (95% CI: 2.2, 19.4) higher in the active vs. placebo periods. The intervention is now ready for testing in randomized clinical trials.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592670","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.747018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.634618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.630976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.589042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.529028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.500359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.132057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0720864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Text messaging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Stereotypy","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"Plug-in (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)"},{"name":"Instant messaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Craving (withdrawal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craving_(withdrawal)"},{"name":"Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_of_the_Secretary-General's_Panel_of_Experts_on_Accountability_in_Sri_Lanka"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"}]}
