{"id":28537,"title":"[A woman with complaints after an injection of diclofenac].","abstract":"A 61-year-old woman came to the Emergency Department with a skin lesion located at her right upper leg. At the site of the lesion a subcutaneous injection of diclofenac had been administered for pain from nephrolithiasis. CT revealed a large infiltrate proximal in the right upper leg; histologic evaluation of the tissue showed an acute necrotizing inflammation. These findings are typical for Nicolau syndrome.
