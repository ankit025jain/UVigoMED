{"id":76590,"title":"Percent body fat more associated with perioperative risks after total joint arthroplasty than body mass index.","abstract":"Understanding the impact of obesity on elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains critical. Perioperative outcomes were reviewed in 316 patients undergoing primary TJA. Higher percent body fat (PBF) was associated with postoperative blood transfusion, increased hospital length of stay (LOS) >3 days, and discharge to an extended care facility while no significant differences existed for BMI. Additionally, PBF of 43.5 was associated with a 2.4× greater likelihood of blood transfusion, PBF of 36.5 with a 1.9× greater likelihood for LOS >3 days, and PBF of 36.0 with a 1.4× greater likelihood for discharge to an extended care facility. PBF may be a more effective measure than BMI to use in screening for perioperative risks and acute outcomes associated with obese total joint patients.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973929","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.572399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.554413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.397409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.262149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.056379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"International Air Transport Association airport code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Elective surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery"},{"name":"Waco F series","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_F_series"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
