{"id":87370,"title":"[Application of free flap pedicled with supracarpal cutaneous branch of ulnar artery in repairing of finger replantation].","abstract":"To evaluate clinical application and clinical outcomes of free flap pedicled with supracarpal cutaneous branch of ulnar artery in repairing of finger replantation with skin defect.From April 2007 to March 2013,25 patients affected by finger amputation with skin defect were replanted and repaired by free flap pedicled with supracarpal cutaneous branch of ulnar artery. Among them, 18 patients were male and 7 were female,with an average age of 31.5 years old (ranged 16 to 58). The time of trauma to admission ranged from 45 to 210 min (averaged 105). Fifteen patients were complete separted, and 10 patients were non-complete separated. The area of flaps ranged from 3.5 cm x 2.0 cm to 4.5 cm x 3.0 cm, and the vessels were anastomosed through end-to-end. The functional evaluation standard of finger replantation was used to evaluate the postoperative function.Twenty-four cases were finally survived. Two flaps occurred vascular crisisin within 48 h after operation, one of which was survived after anti-vasospasm treatment and changing dressing,another was replanted finger for failed to survive. One had infection and healed after changing dressing. Twenty-four cases were followed up from 3 to 38 months with an average of 16.5 months. The appearance and texture of flaps were satisfactory, and the superficial senses of pain and touch were recovered,and two-point discrimination was 5.5 to 11 mm (averaged 7.4 mm). According to functional evaluation standard finger replantationissued by Hand Surgery Association of Chinese Medical Association, 8 cases got excellent results, 14 good and 2 poor.The free flap pedicled with supracarpal cutaneous branch of ulnar artery can be used in complex finger replantation with skin and vessels defect, which can extend operation indications, recover function and appearance for maximum.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241464","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma
