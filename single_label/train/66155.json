{"id":66155,"title":"Genome-wide association scan for variants associated with early-onset prostate cancer.","abstract":"Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related mortality for men in the United States. There is strong empirical and epidemiological evidence supporting a stronger role of genetics in early-onset prostate cancer. We performed a genome-wide association scan for early-onset prostate cancer. Novel aspects of this study include the focus on early-onset disease (defined as men with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 56 years) and use of publically available control genotype data from previous genome-wide association studies. We found genome-wide significant (p<5Ã—10(-8)) evidence for variants at 8q24 and 11p15 and strong supportive evidence for a number of previously reported loci. We found little evidence for individual or systematic inflated association findings resulting from using public controls, demonstrating the utility of using public control data in large-scale genetic association studies of common variants. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of established common genetic variants for early-onset prostate cancer and the power of including early-onset prostate cancer cases in genetic association studies.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740154","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.451077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.395022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.192612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0197861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Taken (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"CDKN2B","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN2B"},{"name":"Chromosome 8 (human)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_8_(human)"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Economic interventionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
