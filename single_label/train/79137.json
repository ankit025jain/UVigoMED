{"id":79137,"title":"Proposed norms for the Glasgow hearing-aid benefit profile (Ghabp) questionnaire.","abstract":"To form a normative set of responses to the GHABP questionnaire from a large regional dataset.Participants were asked to rate their hearing disability, handicap, hearing-aid (HA) use, HA benefit, HA satisfaction, and residual (aided) disability on a five-point scale for four situations: quiet conversation, television (TV) listening, noisy conversation, and group conversation. A subset of participants also estimated the time spent in these situations.A group of 1574 adults with normal to profound hearing thresholds participated.There was a significant relationship between increasing perceived disability and increasing hearing loss as given by the better-ear audiometric average (BEA). Responses for HA measures did not vary greatly with hearing loss: HA use was reported as high, whereas residual disability, HA benefit, and satisfaction were all reported on average as moderate.The results can be used as a normative dataset with which to evaluate individual responses in the clinic, where the GHABP provides a useful short-form questionnaire to engage the patient. The lack of systematic changes in hearing-aid related responses shows room for improvement in the benefit afforded by amplification.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484267","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.441988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.352839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.29024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.231282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Conversation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Improvisational theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"1574","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1574"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
