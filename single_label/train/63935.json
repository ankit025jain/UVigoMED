{"id":63935,"title":"The prognostic value of interim positron emission tomography scan in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"The prognostic value of interim positron emission tomography (PET) was evaluated after 2 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastin and dacarbazine in classical Hodgkin lymphoma patients (n = 229), based on Deauville criteria. In early stage non-bulky disease, bulky stage II disease, advanced stage low International Prognostic Score (IPS ?2) and advanced stage (IPS ?3), 3-year progression-free survival rates in PET2-negative vs. PET2-positive groups were 95·9% vs. 76·9% (P < 0·0018), 83·3% vs. 20·0% (P = 0·017), 77·0% vs. 30·0% (P < 0·001) and 71·0% vs. 44·4%(P = 0·155), respectively. The outcome after positive PET2 was better than previously reported. The results from non-randomized studies of PET2-guided therapy would be valuable with careful interpretation.
