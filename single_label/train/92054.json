{"id":92054,"title":"Re-irradiation for painful heel spur syndrome. Retrospective analysis of 101 heels.","abstract":"Painful heel spur syndrome is a common disease with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 10?%. One of the most effective treatment options is radiotherapy. Many authors recommend a second or third series of radiation for recurrent pain and partial or no response to the initial treatment. As the results of re-irradiation have not been systematically analyzed the aim of this study was to document the results of repeated radiation treatment and to identify patients who could benefit from this treatment.The analysis was performed on patients from 2 German radiotherapy institutions and included 101 re-irradiated heels. Pain was documented with the numeric rating scale (NRS) and carried out before and directly after each radiation therapy as well as for the follow-up period of 24 months. The median age of the patients was 56 years with 30.1?% male and 69.9?% female patients. Pain was caused by plantar fasciitis in 72.3?%, Haglund's exostosis in 15.8?% and Achilles tendinitis in 11.9?%. Repeated radiation was indicated because the initial radiotherapy resulted in no response in 35.6?% of patients, partial response in 39.6?% and recurrent pain in 24.8?%.A significant response to re-irradiation could be found. For the whole sample the median NRS pain score was 6 before re-irradiation, 2 after 6 weeks and 0 after 12 and 24 months. Of the patients 73.6?% were free of pain 24 months after re-irradiation. All subgroups, notably those with no response, partial response and recurrent pain had a significant reduction of pain.Re-irradiation of painful heel spur syndrome is an effective and safe treatment. All subgroups showed a good response to re-irradiation for at least 24 months.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452814","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.715254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.610599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.562585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tendinitis","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.199306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.129987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Achilles","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles"},{"name":"Plantar fasciitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis"},{"name":"Achilles tendinitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendinitis"},{"name":"Exostosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exostosis"},{"name":"Calcaneal spur","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneal_spur"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Fasciitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciitis"},{"name":"University of California Natural Reserve System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California_Natural_Reserve_System"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Number","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Heel","weight":0.0130527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel"}]}
