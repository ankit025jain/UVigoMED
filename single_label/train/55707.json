{"id":55707,"title":"Morphologic features of focal choroidal excavation on spectral domain optical coherence tomography with simultaneous angiography.","abstract":"To reveal clinically relevant morphologic findings in patients with focal choroidal excavation (FCE) using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography.Thirty-one FCE lesions in 29 eyes of 26 patients (21 men, 23 eyes; 5 women, 6 eyes) were studies. In all 26 patients, color fundus photographs were obtained, and fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography with simultaneous enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography were performed. Twenty-five eyes also underwent angiographic video recording.Focal choroidal excavation was detected in eyes with typical age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, and idiopathic choroidal neovascularization, whereas in 8 eyes, FCE was considered to be idiopathic. Morphologically, FCE lesions were classified into 3 types: cone-shaped, bowl-shaped, and mixed. The cone-shaped type was detected in 17 lesions, bowl-shaped in 8, and mixed in 6, on optical coherence tomography findings. All bowl-shaped and mixed types had retinal pigment epithelial irregularities within the FCE lesion. The cone-shaped type was not observed in eyes with typical age-related macular degeneration.Morphologically, FCE lesions were classified into cone-shaped, bowl-shaped, and mixed types, based on optical coherence tomography findings. Focal choroidal excavation formation may be associated in part with chorioretinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and central serous chorioretinopathy, whereas some eyes are considered to have idiopathic FCE.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830823","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.891514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.852719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.750661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.742497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.633837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.486601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.477409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.422243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.38219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Indocyanine green","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indocyanine_green"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.341876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Central serous retinopathy","weight":0.291481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.271491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.204754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.185466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.140389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.069656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
