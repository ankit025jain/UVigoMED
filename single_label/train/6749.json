{"id":6749,"title":"[Comparative study on effects of Rubiae Radix et Rhizoma and carbonized Rubiae Radix et Rhizoma on acute blood stasis rat model].","abstract":"To observe the effects of Rubiae Radix et Rhizoma (RRR) and carbonized Rubiae Radix et Rhizoma (CRRR) on the acute blood stasis rat model, and reveal their differences in efficacy.The acute blood stasis model was induced by subcutaneously injecting adrenaline hydrochloride and soaking in ice water. Yunnan Baiyao was used as the positive control drug, and administered for consecutively seven days. This model was adopted to observe the effect of high, middle and low dose RRR and CRRR groups on hemorheology, thrombin activity, and blood platelet system.RRR could significantly reduce the wholeblood viscosity and plasma viscosity of blood stasis rats under different shear rates, and showed certain two-way regulating function in hemostasis. It also showed certain effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation rate, but which was lower than CRRR. CRRR achieved the main hemostatic mechanism by stimulating intrinsic and extrinsic blood coagulation and fibrinogen, and could significantly enhance the platelet aggregation rate of rats in the acute blood stasis model (P <0. 01).RRR had the effect of removing blood stasis and hemostasis, while CRRR mainly has the hemostatic effect. This further demonstrates the traditional processing theory of \"promoting blood circulation with crude herbs and stopping bleeding with processed herbs\".","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946554","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Platelet aggregation","weight":0.710297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_aggregation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Viscosity","weight":0.651895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.431096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.359393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.173167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Yunnan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan"},{"name":"Stasis (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Ice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"}]}
