{"id":43828,"title":"Green synthesis of pullulan stabilized gold nanoparticles for cancer targeted drug delivery.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to synthesize green chemistry based gold nanoparticles using liver specific biopolymer and to develop a liver cancer targeted drug delivery system with enhanced efficacy and minimal side effects. Pullulan stabilized gold nanoparticles (PAuNPs) were coupled with 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) and folic acid (Fa) which could be used as a tool for targeted drug delivery and imaging of cancer. The toxicity of 5-Fu, 5-Fu adsorbed gold nanoparticles (5-Fu@AuNPs), Fa-coupled 5-Fu adsorbed gold nanoparticles (5-Fu@AuNPs-Fa), was studied using zebrafish embryo as an in vivo model. The in vitro cytotoxicity of free 5-Fu, 5-Fu@AuNPs, 5-Fu@AuNPs-Fa against HepG2 cells was studied and found that the amount of 5-Fu required to achieve 50% of growth of inhibition (Ic50) was much lower in 5-Fu@AuNP-Fa than in free 5-Fu, 5-Fu@AuNPs. The in vivo biodistribution of PAuNPs showed that higher amount of gold had been accumulated in liver (54.42Â±5.96 ?g) than in other organs.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762575","annotations":[{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Biopolymer","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolymer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.745409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.689003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.625719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.52769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.521606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.515992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.463022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.449784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Zebrafish","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.386312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Green chemistry","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_chemistry"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.328957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.277602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Colloidal gold","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Green tea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
