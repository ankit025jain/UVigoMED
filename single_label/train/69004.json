{"id":69004,"title":"Biglycan-triggered TLR-2- and TLR-4-signaling exacerbates the pathophysiology of ischemic acute kidney injury.","abstract":"Exacerbated inflammation in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, the major cause of intrinsic acute renal failure, is a key trigger of kidney damage. During disease endogenous danger signals stimulate innate immune cells via Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and -4 and accelerate inflammatory responses. Here we show that production of soluble biglycan, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is induced during reperfusion and that it functions as endogenous agonist of TLR-2/4. Biglycan-mediated activation of TLR-2/4 initiates an inflammatory response in native kidneys, which is marked by the release of cytokines and chemokines and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Overexpression of soluble circulating biglycan before ischemic reperfusion enhanced plasma and renal levels of TNF-?, CXCL1, CCL2 and CCL5, caused influx of neutrophils, macrophages and T cells and overall worsened renal function in wild type mice. We provide robust genetic evidence for TLR-2/4 requirement insofar as biglycan biological effects were markedly dampened in mice deficient in both innate immune receptors, Tlr2(-/-);Tlr4(-/-) mice. Thus, signaling of soluble biglycan via TLR-2/4 could represent a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and possible treatment of patients with acute renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.
