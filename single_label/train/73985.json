{"id":73985,"title":"The continual reassessment method for multiple toxicity grades: a bayesian model selection approach.","abstract":"Grade information has been considered in Yuan et al. (2007) wherein they proposed a Quasi-CRM method to incorporate the grade toxicity information in phase I trials. A potential problem with the Quasi-CRM model is that the choice of skeleton may dramatically vary the performance of the CRM model, which results in similar consequences for the Quasi-CRM model. In this paper, we propose a new model by utilizing bayesian model selection approach--Robust Quasi-CRM model--to tackle the above-mentioned pitfall with the Quasi-CRM model. The Robust Quasi-CRM model literally inherits the BMA-CRM model proposed by Yin and Yuan (2009) to consider a parallel of skeletons for Quasi-CRM. The superior performance of Robust Quasi-CRM model was demonstrated by extensive simulation studies. We conclude that the proposed method can be freely used in real practice.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875783","annotations":[{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.257007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.191344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Model selection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Parallel (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry)"},{"name":"Yuan Dynasty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Dynasty"},{"name":"Inheritance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Customer relationship management","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management"}]}
