{"id":62295,"title":"[A case of angiosarcoma of the spleen with intraperitoneal bleeding].","abstract":"A 56-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a history of abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite. Six days later, he suddenly went into shock; despite repeated blood transfusions, he died. Autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a ruptured splenic angiosarcoma, which had metastasized to multiple sites in the liver and bone. Splenic angiosarcoma is rare, and its pathophysiology is unclear. When presented with splenic angiosarcoma or suggestive symptoms, including splenic bleeding, splenomegaly, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain, we should carefully monitor the patient for signs of coagulopathy and prepare for the possibility of rapid progression to disseminated intravascular coagulation. In general, patients with angiosarcoma have a poor prognosis. Therefore, we hope this report will help in improving the prognosis of patients suffering from angiosarcoma by contributing to the limited clinical experience.
