{"id":2542,"title":"Evaluation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in matched cat sera and house dust samples: investigation of a potential link between PBDEs and spontaneous feline hyperthyroidism.","abstract":"The cause of feline hyperthyroidism (FH), a common endocrinopathy of domestic cats, is unknown. A potential association between exposure to environmental contaminants polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and FH was investigated. The median serum level for the sum of congeners BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-153, BDE-154 and BDE-183 (?5) in hyperthyroid and euthyroid cats was 82 and 174 ng g(-1)lw respectively with no significant difference in PBDE levels or profiles between groups. Overall, the median (min to max) concentration of PBDEs in cat serum (n=65) was 118 ng g(-1)lw (5-5260 ng g(-1)lw), which is approximately 10 times higher than that observed in the Australian human population. Furthermore, congener composition in feline serum samples was dominated by congener BDE-99, followed by BDE-47 then BDE-153 which differs from results of human biomonitoring. There was no correlation between PBDE levels in feline serum samples and matched house dust samples (n=25). However the similarity of BDE-47/99 ratio in each matrix suggests dust is likely the dominant exposure. Calculation of the daily exposure dose via dust ingestion for cats equated to a mean of 33 ng kg(-1) bw d(-1) (0.2-150 ng kg(-1) bw d(-1)). Differences in exposure estimates for Australian and US cats, based on dust ingestion alone, are consistent with the observed differences in body burdens. Our results do not support a role for PBDE exposure in the aetiopathogenesis of FH.","date":"2014-12-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25460634","annotations":[{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.411587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.407872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.345804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.319056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Biomonitoring","weight":0.280998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomonitoring"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.164836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Ether","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Euthyroid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyroid"},{"name":"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybrominated_diphenyl_ethers"},{"name":"Congener","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congener"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Biphenyl","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphenyl"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Calculation (card game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation_(card_game)"},{"name":"Borland Database Engine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Database_Engine"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Felidae","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae"}]}
