{"id":43315,"title":"[Liver diseases].","abstract":"Hepatic encephalopathy is frequently accompanied by reversible cognitive impairment, while chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration is a rare irreversible neurological disorder in patients with liver cirrhosis, characterized by parkinsonism and cognitive decline. Patients with Wilson disease can also present cognitive deficits. Recently, it was reported that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) might be a risk factor for cognitive impairment. There may be the links among obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, NAFLD, insulin resistance and cognitive impairment. Reduced liver biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) might also contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. The associations between chronic liver diseases and cognitive impairment need further investigation.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796105","annotations":[{"name":"Docosahexaenoic acid","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Wilson's disease","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.860937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.810292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Hepatic encephalopathy","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.71041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.695057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.612904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.352246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.250999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cognitive deficit","weight":0.172547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}]}
