{"id":21148,"title":"Auger-architectomics: introducing a new nanotechnology to infectious disease.","abstract":"In 2010, we developed a new imaging nanotechnology called Auger-architectomics, to study drug biosensors in nano-detail. We succeeded in applying Auger atom electron physics coupled to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Argon-etching to cell structure exploration, thereby exposing a new dimension in structure and element composition architecture. Auger-architectomics was used to expose the fate and effect of drugs on cells. This technology should now be expanded to diseased cells. This paper will outline the development, proof of concept, and application of this imaging nanotechnology. A virtual tour is available at: http://vimeo.com/user6296337 .
