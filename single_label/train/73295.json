{"id":73295,"title":"Outcomes after flap reconstruction for extremity soft tissue sarcoma: a case-control study using propensity score analysis.","abstract":"Because of the complexity of flap reconstruction and the magnitude of soft tissue defects, patients undergoing flap reconstruction for extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) may have increased morbidity and poor outcome compared with those undergoing primary closure. However, to examine the accurate impact of flap reconstruction on extremity STS patients, the potential bias by confounding factors should be minimized.We used propensity score analysis to match 37 patients who underwent flap reconstruction to 111 patients who underwent primary closure (1-3 ratio) based on patient and tumor characteristics at presentation. Treatment, functional, and oncologic outcomes were compared between the two groups.Flap reconstruction group showed a lower Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional score (P < 0.001), higher wound complication rate (P < 0.001), and longer hospital stay (P < 0.001); but had better local control (P = 0.015) than the primary closure group. Although failing to reach the statistical significance, the flap group tended to secure a wider surgical margin than the primary closure group (P = 0.051).Patients who underwent flap reconstruction had increased morbidity associated with flap reconstruction, but better local control. These findings may have implications for treating extremity STS patients.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915855","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.302434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Soft-tissue sarcoma","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-tissue_sarcoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Surgical margin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_margin"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
