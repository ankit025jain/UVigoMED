{"id":21272,"title":"Highly-cited estimates of the cumulative incidence and recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis are inadequately documented.","abstract":"Available literature concerning the epidemiologic or clinical features of vulvovaginal candidiasis commonly reports that: 75% of women will experience an episode of vulvovaginal candidiasis in their lifetimes, 50% of whom will experience at least a second episode, and 5-10% of all women will experience recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (?4 episodes/1Â year). In this debate we traced the three commonly cited statistics to their presumed origins.It is apparent that these figures were inadequately documented and lacked supporting epidemiologic evidence. Population-based studies are needed to make reliable estimates of the lifetime risk of vulvovaginal candidiasis and the proportion of women who experience recurrent candidiasis.The extent to which vulvovaginal candidiasis is a source of population-level morbidity remains uncertain.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612727","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.370352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0597954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"List of Jewish American politicians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_American_politicians"}]}
