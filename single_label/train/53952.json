{"id":53952,"title":"Adding glimepiride to insulin+metformin in type 2 diabetes of more than 10 years' duration--a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.","abstract":"To investigate the effect on glycaemic control of adding glimepiride to on-going treatment with metformin and insulin in patients with known diabetes more than 10 years.Glimepiride 4 mg or placebo was added in randomised order for three months with a washout period of 6 weeks. All insulin regimens were allowed. Insulin doses were reduced if considered necessary. Continuous glucose monitoring was performed at the end of each period.Forty-three patients, median age 66 years (46-74), diabetes duration 16 (10-30), BMI 30 kg/m(2) (25-37) and mean HbA1c 7.1% NGSP, (64 mmol/mol IFCC) were randomised. With placebo there was no change in HbA1c while a decrease of 0.6%, (7 mmol/mol IFCC) (P < 0.001), was observed with glimepiride even though insulin doses had to be reduced in 23 patients (median change 29%, range 2-100%). Minor hypoglycaemia was reported but no severe hypoglycaemic event was observed. The ratio between C-peptide/glucose increased significantly (P < 0.001) with glimepiride, both fasting and postprandially and, in a stepwise multiple regression analysis of possible predictive factors for response, a more pronounced decrease in HbA1c was associated with the magnitude of the increment in C-peptide/glucose. Older age was associated with a smaller response. Twenty-nine patients (67%) were defined as responders if this was defined as an HbA1c decrease ?0.5% (5 mmol/mol IFCC) or an insulin dose reduction ?20%.Even after long duration of diabetes, addition of glimepiride to insulin and metformin can be effective in lowering HbA1c and/or reducing the need for exogenous insulin.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485398","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.804468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.712035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.709475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.626629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.444756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.305469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Glimepiride","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glimepiride"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.228042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"1030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1030"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Glossary of Gaelic games terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Gaelic_games_terms"},{"name":"Run-in period","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-in_period"},{"name":"International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Clinical_Chemistry_and_Laboratory_Medicine"},{"name":"Washout (aviation)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washout_(aviation)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.0146617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"}]}
