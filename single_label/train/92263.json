{"id":92263,"title":"Ankylosing spondylitis: correlations between clinical and MRI indices of sacroiliitis activity.","abstract":"To analyse the correlations between clinical and MRI sacroiliitis activity indices in ankylosing spondylitis (AS).Sixteen normal volunteers and 52 patients were enrolled. The clinical AS activity indices included the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score, serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The MRI sacroiliitis activity indices included apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of bone and the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) score.The mean SPARCC score of the control group was 0 and of the AS group was 9.9 ± 9.1 (range 0-36). The mean ADC value of the AS group was statistically significantly higher than that of the control group (49.7 ± 20.2 × 10(-5)mm(2)/s versus 38.9 ± 5.3 × 10(-5)mm(2)/s, p < 0.05). The BASDAI score showed a statistically significant correlation with the SPARCC score (r = 0.685, p < 0.05) and with ADC values (r = 0.329, p < 0.05). ADC values correlated with the SPARCC score (r = 0.390, p < 0.05).ADC values and the SPARCC index may be useful activity indices in AS.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25459199","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.665273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.650072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.506583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Spondyloarthropathy","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondyloarthropathy"},{"name":"Sacroiliitis","weight":0.300301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliitis"},{"name":"Ankylosing spondylitis","weight":0.263889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.24992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Brownian motion","weight":0.116055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"685","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/685"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"2100s (decade)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2100s_(decade)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Spondylitis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylitis"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Consortium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Bath, Somerset","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset"}]}
