{"id":76010,"title":"MicroRNA-132, -134, and -138: a microRNA troika rules in neuronal dendrites.","abstract":"Dendritic mRNA transport and local translation in the postsynaptic compartment play an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Local protein synthesis at the synapse has to be precisely orchestrated by a plethora of factors including RNA binding proteins as well as microRNAs, an extensive class of small non-coding RNAs. By binding to complementary sequences in target mRNAs, microRNAs fine-tune protein synthesis and thereby represent critical regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Research over the last years identified an entire network of dendritic microRNAs that fulfills an essential role in synapse development and physiology. Recent studies provide evidence that these small regulatory molecules are highly regulated themselves, at the level of expression as well as function. The importance of microRNAs for correct function of the nervous system is reflected by an increasing number of studies linking dysregulation of microRNA pathways to neurological disorders. By focusing on three extensively studied examples (miR-132, miR-134, miR-138), this review will attempt to illustrate the complex regulatory roles of dendritic microRNAs at the synapse and their implications for pathological conditions.
