{"id":9196,"title":"Effect of short-term rapid ventricular pacing followed by pacing interruption on arterial blood pressure in healthy pigs and pigs with tachycardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Ventricular tachycardia may lead to haemodynamic deterioration and, in the case of long term persistence, is associated with the development of tachycardiomyopathy. The effect of ventricular tachycardia on haemodynamics in individuals with tachycardiomyopathy, but being in sinus rhythm has not been studied. Rapid ventricular pacing is a model of ventricular tachycardia. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of rapid ventricular pacing on blood pressure in healthy animals and those with tachycardiomyopathy. A total of 66 animals were studied: 32 in the control group and 34 in the study group. The results of two groups of examinations were compared: the first performed in healthy animals (133 examinations) and the second performed in animals paced for at least one month (77 examinations). Blood pressure measurements were taken during chronic pacing--20 min after onset of general anaesthesia, in baseline conditions (20 min after pacing cessation or 20 min after onset of general anaesthesia in healthy animals) and immediately after short-term rapid pacing. In baseline conditions significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found in healthy animals than in those with tachycardiomyopathy. During an event of rapid ventricular pacing, a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found in both groups of animals. In the group of chronically paced animals the blood pressure was lower just after restarting ventricular pacing than during chronic pacing. Cardiovascular adaptation to ventricular tachycardia develops with the length of its duration. Relapse of ventricular tachycardia leads to a blood pressure decrease more pronounced than during chronic ventricular pacing.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724474","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular tachycardia","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sinus rhythm","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_rhythm"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.65184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.615614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.436373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.317019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Arterial blood","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
