{"id":90427,"title":"[Clinical characteristics of 42 cases of spontaneous intracranial hypotension with cerebrospinal leakage].","abstract":"To review the clinical characteristics of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage.Clinical data of 42 SIH patients with cerebrospinal leakage, whose diagnosis met the criteria of the International Headache Classification, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into short (n=27) and long (n=15) course groups. The clinical data and imaging features were compared between two groups.Thirty-nine patients (92.9%) had orthostatic headache. Compared with the short course group, the frequency of headache were significantly lower in patients with long disease duration (80% vs 100%, P =0.040); the ratio of high CSF opening pressure (>=60.0 mm H2O), the average CSF opening pressure, and the frequencies of subdural hematoma were higher in long course group than those in short course group [60.0% vs 20.8%, (64.7±42.1) vs (40.0±33.8)mm H2O, and 50.0% vs 11.6%; P=0.019, 0.038 and 0.018, respectively]. Forty-two patients underwent CT myelography;definite focal CSF leakage sites were found in all patients and multiple sites of CSF leakage in 38 patients.All SIH do not necessarily show the typical clinical manifestations, and cranial MRI and CT myelography are helpful in the diagnosis. Because of higher risk of subdural hemorrhage, patients with long disease duration require active intervention.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616466","annotations":[{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.904407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.858873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.785708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.592781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension","weight":0.488007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_intracranial_hypotension"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.485106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.281535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak","weight":0.260586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_cerebrospinal_fluid_leak"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Myelography","weight":0.151538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelography"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.149614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Orthostatic hypotension","weight":0.115606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
