{"id":66447,"title":"Clinical consequences of nephrectomy performed on medical grounds.","abstract":"Epidemiological data show that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious social problem and nowadays is included amongst civilisation diseases. Knowing the relation between decrease in the number of nephrons and progressing kidney damage caused by it, we can treated each nephrectomy from medical reasons as a risk factor for development of CKD. The aim of this study was a retrospective analysis of clinical effects of nephrectomy, taking into account evaluation of a functional status of the sole kidney.The study covered 182 patients after nephrectomy in the period from 1979 to 2008. The morphological and functional status of the remaining kidney was evaluated using ultrasound scanning and on a basis of serum levels of creatinine, as well as the glomerular filtration rate. Occurrence of proteinuria and blood pressure values were also verified.The average creatinine serum levels increases after nephrectomy and is positively correlated with the age. The mean eGFR level is lower after nephrectomy and is correlated with kidney dimensions in the long-term control after nephrectomy, and with the age. The average systolic and diastolic blood pressure after nephrectomy in the long-term observation was higher as compare with values before procedure. Presence of protein in the urine of patients after nephrectomy correlated positively with increased blood pressure values.Nephrectomy constitute the risk factor of development of CKD and hypertension. Patients after nephrectomy needs systematic nephrological care to prevent CKD progression.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712260","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.705314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.554351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.488739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.356398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.232466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ancient Rome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
