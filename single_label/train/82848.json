{"id":82848,"title":"Expression of the cancer stem cell markers CD44v6 and ABCG2 in tongue cancer: effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on local recurrence.","abstract":"The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is controversial, and no report supports NAC with a high evidence level. Recently, we showed that a deep surgical margin was resected very close to the tumor site in many NAC-treated oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that NAC may lead to local recurrence and poor outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of NAC on tumor local recurrence using cancer stem cell marker immunohistochemistry. We retrospectively analyzed 89 patients who underwent radical surgery for tongue cancer, and examined the effect of NAC on tumor local recurrence. Cancer stem cell marker (CD44v6 and ABCG2) expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. In our study, the local recurrence rate was 12.4%. CD44v6 and ABCG2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis, pattern of invasion, depth of invasion, perineural invasion and local recurrence, respectively. Tumor local recurrence was a significant independent predictive factor of the 5-year disease specific survival. CD44v6 or ABCG2 positivity in NAC-treated patients was significantly associated with tumor local recurrence. It was suggested that local recurrence in NAC-treated cases is associated with cancer stem-like cells. We propose that NAC leads to the selection and/or residue of more aggressive cancer stem-like cells.
