{"id":33011,"title":"Validity of an accelerometer as a vertical ground reaction force measuring device in healthy children and adolescents and in children and adolescents with osteogenesis imperfecta type I.","abstract":"Vertical ground reaction forces (vGRFs) are closely related to bone strength and development. It is therefore relevant to assess these forces in bone disorders accompanied with muscle weakness such as in osteogenesis imperfecta type I (OI type I). The purpose of the present study was to assess the validity of vGRFs derived from an accelerometer.Fourteen children and adolescents with a diagnosis of OI type I (age range: 7 to 21; mean age [SD]: 14.1 [4.8] years; 5 males) and fourteen healthy controls (age range: 6 to 21; mean age [SD]: 12.5 [4.2] years; 5 males) performed three repetitions of five different jump and rise tests on a ground reaction force plate. Jumps and rises outcomes were measured simultaneously with the ground reaction force plate and an accelerometer.Pearson correlation coefficients were over 0.96 (p<0.001) for the five tests. The limits of agreement represented between 17 and 31% of the average peak force measured by both devices. The accelerometer is a promising tool to assess ground reaction forces in everyday life settings and has been shown to be sufficiently sensitive to detect muscular weakness in children and adolescent with OI type I.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879019","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.379983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.243843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Force platform","weight":0.223432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_platform"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Measuring instrument","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_instrument"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Accelerometer","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Ground reaction force","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_reaction_force"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Ancient Greece","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"},{"name":"Karl Pearson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson"},{"name":"Reaction (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_(physics)"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Oi (telecommunications)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oi_(telecommunications)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}]}
