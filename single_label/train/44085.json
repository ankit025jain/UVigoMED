{"id":44085,"title":"[Changes of hypoxia-inducible factor in residual hepatocellular carcinoma following high-intensity focused ultrasound exposure in nude mice].","abstract":"To study the changes in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1?, HIF2?) in the residual tumor cells in nude mice bearing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following treatment with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).Thirty nude mice bearing human HCC received treatment with HIFU. At 1, 3, and 5 days and 1 and 2 weeks after the treatment, the mice were examined for pathological changes of the residual tumor with HE staining; SP immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR were used to detect the protein and mRNA expressions of HIF1? and HIF2? in the tumor.HE staining revealed the presence of residual tumor cells and large necrotic areas after the treatment. Immunohistochemistry showed a gradual increment of HIF1? protein and mRNA expressions after the treatment, reaching the peak level at 3 days (P<0.05) followed by progressive reduction at 5 days and 1 and 2 weeks. HIF2? expressions at either the protein or mRNA levels exhibited no significant changes within 3 days after the treatment (P>0.05) but increased significantly at 5 days and 1 and 2 weeks (P<0.05).The changes of HIF1? and HIF2? in the residual tumor after HIFU treatment in nude mice bearing HCC can be associated with tumor cell apoptosis and angiogenesis after the treatment.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752088","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.804236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.59816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"High-intensity focused ultrasound","weight":0.489837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_focused_ultrasound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.452618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.357057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.322685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
