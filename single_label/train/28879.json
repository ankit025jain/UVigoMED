{"id":28879,"title":"Red cell distribution width as a predictor of mortality in organophosphate insecticide poisoning.","abstract":"Suicide by organophosphate insecticide (OPI) poisoning is a major clinical concern (predominantly in developing countries), and 200000 deaths occur annually worldwide. Red cell distribution width (RDW) has been used to predict outcome in several clinical conditions. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the RDW and 30-day mortality during OPI poisoning.This retrospective analysis was performed between January 2008 and July 2013 in patients admitted to the emergency department after OPI poisoning. A Kaplan-Meier 30-day survival curve was analyzed in patients stratified according to the optimal cut-off point of RDW defined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were conducted to determine the independent prognostic factors for 30-day mortality.Among 102 patients, 21 died, yielding a mortality of 20.6%. Elevated RDW was significantly associated with early mortality in patients with OPI poisoning. Levels of RDW that exceeded 13.5% (hazard ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-6.60) were associated with increased mortality in the multivariate analysis. The area under the ROC curve of RDW was 0.675 (95% CI, 0.522-0.829).This study showed that RDW is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with OPI poisoning.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768665","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence
