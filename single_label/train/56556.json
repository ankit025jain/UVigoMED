{"id":56556,"title":"En face spectral domain optical coherence tomography analysis of lamellar macular holes.","abstract":"To analyze the anatomical characteristics of lamellar macular holes using cross-sectional and en face spectral domain optical coherence tomography.Forty-two lamellar macular holes were retrospectively identified for analysis. The location, cross-sectional length, and area of lamellar holes were measured using B-scans and en face imaging. The presence of photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment disruption and the presence or absence of epiretinal membrane formation were recorded.Forty-two lamellar macular holes were identified. Intraretinal splitting occurred within the outer plexiform layer in 97.6% of eyes. The area of intraretinal splitting in lamellar holes did not correlate with visual acuity. Eyes with inner segment/outer segment disruption had significantly worse mean logMAR visual acuity (0.363 ± 0.169; Snellen = 20/46) than in eyes without inner segment/outer segment disruption (0.203 ± 0.124; Snellen = 20/32) (analysis of variance, P = 0.004). Epiretinal membrane was present in 34 of 42 eyes (81.0%).En face imaging allowed for consistent detection and quantification of intraretinal splitting within the outer plexiform layer in patients with lamellar macular holes, supporting the notion that an area of anatomical weakness exists within Henle's fiber layer, presumably at the synaptic connection of these fibers within the outer plexiform layer. However, the en face area of intraretinal splitting did not correlate with visual acuity, disruption of the inner segment/outer segment junction was associated with significantly worse visual acuity in patients with lamellar macular holes.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667569","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.725454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.702871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.617389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.52984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.334465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.270756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.13571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Outer plexiform layer","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_plexiform_layer"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"2046 (film)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2046_(film)"},{"name":"Epiretinal membrane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiretinal_membrane"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"363","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/363"},{"name":"2032","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2032"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Hermann Snellen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Snellen"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Lamella (materials)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamella_(materials)"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Electron hole","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"}]}
