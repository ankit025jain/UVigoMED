{"id":69059,"title":"Identification by digital immunohistochemistry of intratumoral changes of immune infiltrates after vaccine in the absence of modifications of PBMC immune cell subsets.","abstract":"Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the combination of systemic subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination with intratumoral (i.t.) vaccination was superior in the induction of antitumor activity vs. vaccination with either route alone. A subsequent phase I study employing i.t.-s.c. vaccination was carried out in men with locally recurrent or progressive prostate cancer. rF-PSA-TRICOM (PROSTVAC) vaccine was administered intraprostatically and rV-PSA-TRICOM followed by rF-PSA-TRICOM vaccine was administered systemically. In that study no dose limiting toxicities were observed, 19/21 patients had stable or improved prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) increased in post- vs. pre-treatment tumor biopsies, analyzed employing conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the studies reported here, 31 phenotypes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed prevaccination and postvaccination as well as the functions of PBMC regulatory T cells (Tregs) and natural killer cells. A trend was observed in decreases in serum PSA with the reduction of circulating Tregs postvaccination. Digital IHC was employed prevaccination and postvaccination to measure CD4 and CD8 TILs, as well as Treg TILs by conventional IHC. Few correlations were observed with CD4, CD8 or Treg in TILs vs. PBMCs. However, patients with lower levels of CD4 TILs prevaccination showed the greatest increases in CD4 TILs postvaccine, while Treg TILs decreased postvaccine. There was also a strong correlation between decreases in serum PSA and increases in CD8 TILs postvaccine. These studies provide additional rationale for the use of i.t.-s.c. vaccinations and demonstrate a noncoordinate expression of specific immune subsets in PBMCs vs. tumor.
