{"id":38295,"title":"Cystic fibrosis as a rare cause of apple peel syndrome.","abstract":"Apple peel atresia is a special form of intestinal atresia with absence of mesentery. It is most likely due to an intrauterine intestinal vascular accident and has been described with other anomalies. Meconium ileus can compromise blood supply causing intestinal atresia. Therefore, cystic fibrosis needs to be ruled out in apple peel syndrome.
