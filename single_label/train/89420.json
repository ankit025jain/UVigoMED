{"id":89420,"title":"Postoperative prevention of falls in older adults with fragility fractures.","abstract":"The postoperative period after correction of a fragility fracture is usually associated with functional deconditioning. This deconditioning is caused by multiple factors associated with a higher risk of falls during the immediate postoperative period and after discharge. Identification of risk and appropriate fall prevention interventions in these patients are pivotal. In this article, an overview is presented of the strategies to identify falls risk in postoperative patients after suffering a fragility fracture. Evidence is presented favoring targeted multicomponent intervention for falls prevention rather than a single intervention in fractured older patients at high risk of new falls and fractures.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721372","annotations":[{"name":"Risk","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Deconditioning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconditioning"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Multi-component reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-component_reaction"}]}
