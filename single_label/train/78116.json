{"id":78116,"title":"Impact of identifying factors which trigger bothersome tinnitus on the treatment outcome in tinnitus retraining therapy.","abstract":"The aim of this work was to ascertain any differences in the effectiveness of rehabilitation therapy in relation to the presence or absence of a known negative reinforcement responsible for the tinnitus-related pathology. Between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2008, we recruited 294 subjects suffering from incapacitating tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. The patients underwent tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) according to the methods described by Jastreboff and Hazell [Tinnitus Retraining Therapy: Implementing the Neurophysiological Model. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp 121-133]. We clinically assessed the presence or absence of known phenomena of associative learning, regarding the presence of adverse events temporally correlated with tinnitus and the treatment outcome. The separate analysis of the 2 subgroups shows a statistically significant difference in the improvement rate between the group with a known triggering factor and the group without a triggering factor, with a preponderance of the former with a 91% improvement rate versus approximately 56% for the latter. In our study, the inability to identify factors triggering bothersome tinnitus negatively affected the treatment outcome in TRT.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777173","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.597864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.523583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.479371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"University of Cambridge","weight":0.426848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.336452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.246714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.20076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.173912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Cambridge University Press","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Turkish Radio and Television Corporation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Radio_and_Television_Corporation"},{"name":"Hyperacusis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"List of British ordnance terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_ordnance_terms"},{"name":"Trigger (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)"},{"name":"Hazell (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazell_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Retraining","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraining"},{"name":"Physician-patient privilege","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician-patient_privilege"},{"name":"Associative property","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Retraining (Pugad Baboy story arc)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraining_(Pugad_Baboy_story_arc)"},{"name":"Incapacitation (penology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incapacitation_(penology)"}]}
