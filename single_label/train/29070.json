{"id":29070,"title":"Putative association between the -1415 T/C polymorphism of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) gene and alcohol use disorders in women and men.","abstract":"The activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, which responds to the levels of polyamines, modifies the neurotoxicity caused by ethanol. We aimed to investigate if the functionality of the spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) gene could be associated with a differential risk for alcoholism.We studied a sample of 586 subjects: 104 alcohol-dependent patients, 273 patients with psychiatric disorders but without substance dependence, and 209 healthy controls. After gender stratification, the allele frequency distribution of the SSAT1 gene was compared between these three groups.In females, the TC genotype was significantly more frequent in alcohol-dependent patients than in non-alcohol-dependent psychiatric controls (?(2?)=?7.509 df?=?2, p?=?0.023). A trend was found when alcohol-dependent females were compared with the healthy control group (?(2?)=?4.897 df?=?2, p?=?0.086). No statistical differences were found among the males.Gender differences in the regulation of SSAT1 gene expression may possibly be due to gender-specific effects of stress, ethanol toxicity, and/or polyamines levels. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735382","annotations":[{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.807902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.795711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.772605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.752266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.707902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"Glutamate receptor","weight":0.651267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_receptor"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.648965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.563085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid","weight":0.545087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-D-aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.363124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Polyamine","weight":0.27392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.174836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Distribution (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Putative marriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putative_marriage"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
