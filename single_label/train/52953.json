{"id":52953,"title":"[News in endocrinology in 2013].","abstract":"Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice for acromegaly due to pituitary adenoma but it is not always possible to reduce or control tumor growth, inhibit GH hypersecretion and normalize IGF-I. The first-line drug treatment in 2013 remains the somatostatin analogues. In 2012 and 2013 have been published several publications presenting the prognosis of well-differentiated thyroid cancers of intermediate risk. Indeed, the dose of radioactive iodine administered to patients with \"favorable\" histology in this risk category should be reduced without change in prognosis. Elastograhy could, in combination with conventional ultrasound features, allow a better selection of thyroid nodules that need a cytology, with, however, still limitations in the detection of follicular carcinomas.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558895","annotations":[{"name":"Acromegaly","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly"},{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.844261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.582245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.547915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.487259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.344527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.313413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.201224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.179221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.138706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.0797502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Transsphenoidal surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsphenoidal_surgery"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}]}
