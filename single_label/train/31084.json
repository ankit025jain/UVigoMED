{"id":31084,"title":"The effect of chronic amphetamine treatment on cocaine-induced facilitation of intracranial self-stimulation in rats.","abstract":"Chronic amphetamine treatment reduces cocaine self-administration in pre-clinical and clinical settings, and amphetamine has been proposed as a candidate medication for treatment of cocaine abuse.The objective of the present study was to investigate whether chronic amphetamine treatment can decrease abuse-related cocaine effects in an assay of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS).Thirteen adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were equipped with intracranial electrodes targeting the medial forebrain bundle and trained to lever press for pulses of brain stimulation in a \"frequency-rate\" ICSS procedure. Cocaine (10 mg/kg) was administered before (day 0), during (days 7 and 14), and after (posttreatment days 1 and 3) 2 weeks of continuous treatment with either amphetamine (0.32 mg/kg/h, n?=?7) or saline (n?=?6) via osmotic pump.Prior to treatment, cocaine facilitated ICSS in all rats. Saline treatment had no effect on baseline ICSS or cocaine-induced facilitation of ICSS at any time. Conversely, amphetamine produced a sustained though submaximal facilitation of baseline ICSS, and cocaine produced little additional facilitation of ICSS during amphetamine treatment. Termination of amphetamine treatment produced a depression of baseline ICSS and recovery of cocaine-induced facilitation of ICSS.These data suggest that chronic amphetamine treatment blunts expression of abuse-related cocaine effects on ICSS in rats.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24408209","annotations":[{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.930425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.702842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.540985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.496967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.457338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Osmosis","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.243262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.22796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Forebrain","weight":0.0730255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forebrain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pulse (legume)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(legume)"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Medial forebrain bundle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_forebrain_bundle"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Lever","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Blunt (cigar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_(cigar)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
