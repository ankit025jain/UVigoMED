{"id":90221,"title":"Brain-heart crosstalk: the many faces of stress-related cardiomyopathy syndromes in anaesthesia and intensive care.","abstract":"Neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy (NSC) is a well-known syndrome complicating the early phase after an acute brain injury, potentially affecting outcomes. This article is a review of recent data on the putative role of localization and lateralization of brain lesions in NSC, cardiac innervation abnormalities, and new polymorphisms and other genetic causes of the sympathetic nervous system over-activity. Concerns regarding the management of stress-related cardiomyopathy syndromes during the perioperative period are also discussed. Future clinical research should explore whether specific factors explain different patient susceptibilities to the disease and should be directed towards early identification and stratification of patients at risk, so that such patients can be more carefully monitored and appropriately managed in critical care and during the perioperative period.
