{"id":90350,"title":"Button battery injury in children - a primary care issue?","abstract":"There is a well-described increase in the incidence of significant injury associated with button batteries in children. Button battery ingestion or insertion (ear/nose) is a time-sensitive injury mechanism, with severe injury occurring within hours. Prevention efforts are being developed that may include changes to packaging, public awareness campaigns, safe disposal mechanisms, changes to battery design and changes to device design. However, there is not a single, simple and effective prevention strategy available. This community hazard has significant implications for primary care. This article presents the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of button battery exposure and subsequent injury. It also describes the clinical recommendations, specifically an emphasis on early diagnosis, including maintaining a high index of suspicion; rapid removal where possible or urgent referral for operative intervention.
