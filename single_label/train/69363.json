{"id":69363,"title":"Prevalence of systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with type 1 diabetes without known heart disease: the Thousand & 1 Study.","abstract":"Heart failure is one of the leading causes of mortality in type 1 diabetes. Early identification is vitally important. We sought to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics associated with subclinical impaired systolic and diastolic function in type 1 diabetes patients without known heart disease.In this cross-sectional examination of 1,093 type 1 diabetes patients without known heart disease, randomly selected from the Steno Diabetes Center, complete clinical and echocardiographic examinations were performed and analysed in uni- and multivariable regression models.The mean (SD) age was 49.6 (15) years, 53% of participants were men, and the mean duration of diabetes was 25.5 (15) years. Overall, 15.5% (n = 169) of participants had grossly abnormal systolic or diastolic function, including 1.7% with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)?< 45% and 14.4% with evidence of long-standing diastolic dysfunction. In univariable models, clinical characteristics associated with abnormal myocardial function were: age (per 10 years), OR (95% CI) 2.1 (1.8, 2.4); diabetes duration (per 10 years), 1.7 (1.4, 1.9); systolic BP ? 140 mmHg, 2.7 (1.9, 3.8); diastolic BP ? 90 mmHg, 1.8 (1.0, 3.1); estimated (e)GFR < 60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), 3.8 (2.5, 5.9); microalbuminuria, 2.0 (1.3, 3.0); macroalbuminuria, 5.9 (3.8, 9.3); proliferative retinopathy, 3.6 (2.3, 5.8); blindness, 10.1 (3.2, 31.6); and peripheral neuropathy, 3.8 (2.7, 5.3). In multivariable models only age (2.1 [1.7, 2.5]), female sex, (1.9 [1.2, 2.8]) and macroalbuminuria (5.2 [2.9, 10.3]) remained significantly associated with subclinical grossly abnormal myocardial function.Subclinical myocardial dysfunction is a common finding in type 1 diabetes patients without known heart disease. Type 1 diabetes patients with albuminuria are at greatly increased risk of having subclinical abnormal myocardial function compared with patients without albuminuria. Echocardiography may be particularly warranted in patients with albuminuria.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Male Urogenital
