{"id":10242,"title":"Netrin-1 promotes epithelial sodium channel-mediated alveolar fluid clearance via activation of the adenosine 2B receptor in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury.","abstract":"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is the driving force for pulmonary edema absorption in acute lung injury (ALI). Netrin-1 is a newly found anti-inflammatory factor that works by activating the adenosine 2B receptor (A2BAR). Meanwhile, activated A2BAR has the potential to enhance ENaC-dependent alveolar fluid clearance (AFC). However, whether netrin-1 can increase ENaC-mediated AFC by activating A2BAR remains unclear.To investigate the effect of netrin-1 on AFC in ALI and clarify the pathway via which netrin-1 regulates the expression of ENaC in vivo and in vitro.An ALI model was established by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 mg/kg) in C57BL/J mice, followed by netrin-1 with or without pretreatment with PSB1115, via the caudal vein. Twenty-four hours later, the lungs were isolated for determination of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, AFC, the expressions of ?-, ?-, and ?-ENaC, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. LPS-stimulated MLE-12 cells were incubated with netrin-1 with or without preincubation with PSB1115. Twenty-four hours later, the expressions of ?-, ?-, and ?-ENaC were detected.In vivo, netrin-1 expression was significantly decreased during ALI. Substituted netrin-1 significantly dampened the lung injury, decreased the W/D ratio, and enhanced AFC, the expressions of ?-, ?-, and ?-ENaC, and cAMP levels in ALI, which were abolished by specific A2BAR inhibitor PSB1115. In vitro, netrin-1 increased the expressions of ?-, ?-, and ?-ENaC, which were prevented by PSB1115.These results indicate that netrin-1 dampens pulmonary inflammation and increases ENaC-mediated AFC to alleviate pulmonary edema in LPS-induced ALI by enhancing cAMP levels through the activation of A2BAR.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24663055","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Sodium channel","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Adenosine monophosphate","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.661974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.661925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.613327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.480046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.412878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.352246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Epithelial sodium channel","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_sodium_channel"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Acute lung injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lung_injury"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Substitution reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_reaction"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
