{"id":38710,"title":"White matter integrity in premanifest and early Huntington's disease is related to caudate loss and disease progression.","abstract":"Huntington's disease (HD) is associated with progressive loss of caudate and white matter volume and integrity. Our aim was to systematically assess interactions between these changes and genetic markers of disease progression; we are not aware of previous studies in which this has been explicitly tested.Tract-based spatial statistics were used to assess: (a) differences between the white matter diffusion metrics (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) of 17 premanifest and 19 early manifest HD gene carriers and 21 controls, and (b) the relationships between diffusion metrics, caudate and total white matter volume, and disease burden score and CAG repeat length. Caudate and total white matter volumes were quantified using FIRST and SIENAX respectively. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess which of the imaging metrics predicted disease severity in the HD subjects.Diffusion metrics were significantly altered in premanifest and early HD gene carriers in comparison with controls throughout the white matter skeleton. Correlations between diffusion and volumetric metrics and disease progression were also present. Together, caudate volume and mean white matter fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity predicted disease burden score in the HD subjects.The diffusion properties of white matter are extensively altered in HD, and are associated with markers of HD severity, and with caudate and white matter volumes. The correlation between diffusion metrics and white matter volume is stronger in HD subjects than in controls, but there is no such significant interaction for the correlation between diffusion and caudate volume: we propose that many of the changes in white matter diffusion in HD occur as a 'normal' physiological response to pathological caudate volume loss. We have defined the extent to which mean white matter fractional anisotropy, white matter volume and caudate volume are associated with disease burden score.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405816","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.795798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.712232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.676438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.509297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.439646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.394333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Spatial analysis","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis"},{"name":"Anisotropy","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.221898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.201251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Fractional anisotropy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_anisotropy"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Metric (mathematics)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Caudate nucleus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudate_nucleus"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"The Huntingtons","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Huntingtons"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Inspiration_and_Recognition_of_Science_and_Technology"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"}]}
