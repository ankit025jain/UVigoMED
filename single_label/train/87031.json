{"id":87031,"title":"Stability determinants of murine cytomegalovirus long noncoding RNA7.2.","abstract":"Cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that persistently replicates in glandular epithelial tissue. Murine cytomegalovirus expresses a 7.2-kb-long noncoding RNA (RNA7.2) that is a determinant of viral persistence in the salivary gland. RNA7.2 is an extremely long-lived intron, yet the basis of its stability is unknown. We present data that localize key sequence determinants of RNA stability to the 3' end of RNA7.2 and suggest that stability is a result of sustained lariat conformation.
