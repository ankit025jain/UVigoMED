{"id":61940,"title":"A jagged road to lymphoma aggressiveness.","abstract":"In this issue of Cancer Cell, Cao and colleagues identify an FGF4/Jagged1-driven crosstalk between tumor cells and their vascular niche that activates Notch signaling, sustaining the aggressiveness of certain mouse and human B cell lymphomas. These findings identify new therapeutic opportunities to target pathogenic angiocrine functions in cancer.
