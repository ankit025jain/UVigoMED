{"id":61288,"title":"Pomalidomide for the treatment of relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma: a review of biological and clinical data.","abstract":"Despite the improvements thanks to the introduction of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), nearly all myeloma patients eventually become refractory to these drugs. Consequently, the outcome of these patients is very poor. Pomalidomide is a new IMiD with a similar structure to the commonly used IMiD thalidomide and lenalidomide. Pomalidomide exhibited more potent anti-myeloma activity and a similar favorable safety profile compared with thalidomide and lenalidomide. In Phase I-II studies pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone demonstrated activity in myeloma patients refractory to both bortezomib and IMiDs. Based on the results of a Phase III trial, the FDA and EMA agencies granted accelerated approval to pomalidomide, which is now considered a new effective strategy for relapsed and/or refractory myeloma patients. Very promising results were obtained when pomalidomide-dexamethasone was used in combination with other compounds. This review provides updated information about pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, resistance, clinical efficacy and safety of pomalidomide.
