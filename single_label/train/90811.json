{"id":90811,"title":"[Impact of soft tissue injury on results after osteosynthesis of intraarticular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx of the finger].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate retrospectively if soft tissue injuries have an impact on the functional results of surgically treated intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx.From 1/2007 to 4/2010 we operated on 27 patients with intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx with pins, screws or external fixation analogous to Suzuki. 5 patients were excluded. 13 patients had no significant soft tissue injury (kWTV group), 9 patients had significant soft tissue damage including open fractures, skin lesions or/and severe soft tissue swelling (WTV group). Postoperative function and complications were analysed based on total active range of motion (TAM) and range of motion of the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP-ROM) with regard to the Larsen score and clinical data.Fractures with soft tissue injuries had a significantly worse TAM outcome (p=0.04) than fractures without soft tissue injury (kWTV group: TAM 197.1°; WTV group TAM 231.2°) even if the functional results regarding the Larsen classification were excellent or good in both groups (kWTV 100%, WTV 88.9%). There were no significant differences regarding PIP-ROM of both groups.Soft tissue injuries have a negative impact on the functional results of surgical treated intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx. The influence on PIP-ROM might be less. Other factors might play a considerable role for PIP-ROM. With an adequate operative treatment most intra-articular middle phalanx fractures show good to excellent functional -results.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573827","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.738423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Interphalangeal articulations of hand","weight":0.656261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphalangeal_articulations_of_hand"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phalanx bone","weight":0.354639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/197"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Finger (gesture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(gesture)"},{"name":"Intermediate phalanges","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_phalanges"},{"name":"Suzuki","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki"},{"name":"Impact (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Soft tissue injury","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue_injury"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"}]}
