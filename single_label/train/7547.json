{"id":7547,"title":"Development and application of quantitative detection method for viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genogroup IVa.","abstract":"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a problematic pathogen in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) aquaculture farms in Korea. Thus, it is necessary to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic method to detect this virus. We developed a quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) method based on the nucleocapsid (N) gene sequence of Korean VHSV isolate (Genogroup IVa). The slope and RÂ² values of the primer set developed in this study were -0.2928 (96% efficiency) and 0.9979, respectively. Its comparison with viral infectivity calculated by traditional quantifying method (TCID??) showed a similar pattern of kinetic changes in vitro and in vivo. The qRT-PCR method reduced detection time compared to that of TCID??, making it a very useful tool for VHSV diagnosis.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859343","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.886534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.797214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.702753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Aquaculture","weight":0.700244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Nucleocapsid","weight":0.295575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleocapsid"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.259143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Olive","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_septicemia"},{"name":"Olive flounder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_flounder"},{"name":"Flounder","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flounder"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Enzyme kinetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics"},{"name":"Infectivity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectivity"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
