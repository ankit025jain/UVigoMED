{"id":81909,"title":"Effect of 2 elastomeric ligatures on microbial flora and periodontal status in orthodontic patients.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a nonconventional elastomeric ligature (Slide; Leone, Florence, Italy) with those of a conventional elastomeric ligature (Ormco, Orange, Calif) on microbial flora and periodontal status in orthodontic patients.A total of 13 orthodontic patients scheduled for fixed orthodontic treatment were selected for this study. The use of Slide and conventional elastomeric ligatures in fixed orthodontic appliances was tested. Microbial and periodontal records were obtained before bonding and 1 and 5 weeks after bonding. For the statistical analysis and calculations, SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, Ill) was used. In the statistical decisions, P <0.05 values were accepted as significantly different.No significant differences between Slide and conventional elastomeric ligatures were evident at 1 week or 5 weeks after bonding, with regard to gingival index, plaque index, gingival bleeding index, or pocket depth scores (P >0.05). Similarly, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria counts did not differ significantly on the surface or on the elastics (P >0.05).Although the Slide ligatures cover the total surface of the bracket, they do not cause significantly more plaque accumulation or periodontal problems than do the conventional elastomeric ligatures.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785931","annotations":[{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.750087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.667817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.528555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.434856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.143256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Chicago","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"},{"name":"Human microbiome","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Florence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Typographic ligature","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket"},{"name":"Elastomer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomer"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Orthodontic technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontic_technology"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Software versioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"}]}
