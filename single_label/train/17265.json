{"id":17265,"title":"Clinical access to Bedaquiline Programme for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis.","abstract":"While clinical disease caused by drug-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can usually be treated successfully, clinical disease caused by drug-insensitive MTB is associated with a poorer prognosis. In December 2012, a new drug, bedaquiline, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This article documents the process whereby the National Department of Health, Right to Care and Médecins Sans Frontières obtained access to this medication for South Africans who might benefit from subsequent implementation of the Clinical Access to Bedaquiline Programme.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24897814","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.835226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.451527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Health department","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"2012 phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon"}]}
