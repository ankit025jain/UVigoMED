{"id":91097,"title":"An isolated iliac wing stress fracture in a marathon runner.","abstract":"Iliac stress fractures are uncommon and are usually insufficiency fractures related to osteoporosis. Only 2 previous case reports of iliac stress fractures in runners that extended into the sacroiliac joint, and 1 previous case of an isolated iliac wing stress fracture not involving the sacroiliac joint were found in the English language literature. We report on a second case of an isolated stress fracture of the iliac wing in a female marathon runner and the associated diagnosis of the female athlete triad. Iliac stress fractures can be an occult cause of hip pain in athletes and should be included in the differential diagnosis of hip pain in a marathon runner.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551864","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.623998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.556612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Marathon","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.286088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.26859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.225688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Running","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Female athlete triad","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_athlete_triad"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Sacroiliac joint","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliac_joint"},{"name":"Stress fracture","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0179676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Wing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
