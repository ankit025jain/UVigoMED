{"id":73216,"title":"[The reaction of the immune system to insulinlike growth factor-1 in postmenopausal women with breast cancer].","abstract":"Taking into account the information about the role of insulin-like growth factor -1 (IGF-1) in breast cancer the main aim of the present study was to investigate the cellular immune response to IGF-1. There were examined 58 patients with breast cancer (61 +/- 1 years, BMI 31,2 +/- 0,9 kg/m2, all postmenopausal) and 10 with benign tumors of the breast (56 +/- 2 years, BMI 30,8 +/- 0,7 kg/m2 all menopausal) as well as 17 patients suffering from cancer of different sites. Sensibilization of lymphocytes to IGF-1 was measured in the reaction of blast transformation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. The majority of breast cancer patients (47/58) revealed the sensibilization of peripheral blood lymphocytes to IGF-1. Thus in a part of patients (29 /47) this reaction was suppressed and revealed after suppression of cyclooxygenase and/or blocking of the histamine H2-receptors by corresponding pharmaceutics drugs in vitro.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919265","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.772433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.753434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.708844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.557709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.333448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.31664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.270433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell-mediated immunity","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell-mediated_immunity"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Peripheral blood lymphocyte","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_lymphocyte"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
