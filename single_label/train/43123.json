{"id":43123,"title":"Salidroside attenuates concanavalin A-induced hepatitis via modulating cytokines secretion and lymphocyte migration in mice.","abstract":"Salidroside, isolated from the medicinal plant Rhodiola, was reported to serve as an \"adaptogen.\" This study was designed to explore the protective effect of salidroside on concanavalin A- (Con A-) induced hepatitis in mice and investigate potential mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control group, Con A group, and salidroside group. Salidroside (50?mg/kg) was injected intravenously followed by Con A administration. The levels of ALT, AST, inflammatory cytokines and CXCL-10 were examined. The pathological damage of livers was assessed, the amounts of phosphorylated I?B? and p65 were measured, and the numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the blood, spleen and infiltrated in the liver were calculated. Our results showed that salidroside pretreatment reduced the levels of ALT, AST dramatically and suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines through downregulating the activity of NF-?B partly. Salidroside altered the distribution of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte in the liver and spleen through regulating CXCL-10 and decreased the severity of liver injuries. In conclusion, these results confirm the efficacy of salidroside in the prevention of immune mediated hepatitis in mice.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808635","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.878216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.875641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.688502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.670528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.610968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"CXCL10","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL10"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.537478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Concanavalin A","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concanavalin_A"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Immune-mediated disease","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune-mediated_disease"},{"name":"Adaptogen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptogen"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"}]}
