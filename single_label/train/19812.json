{"id":19812,"title":"PHE speaker outlines Porton Down findings.","abstract":"Speaking at a recent Water Management Society conference, Ginny Moore, of Public Health England (PHE), described how the latest thinking, and the results of recent research and experience on minimising the risk of growth and spread of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in healthcare plumbing systems, as well as input from a number of leading plumbing product manufacturers, had informed the new guidance in the HTM 04-01 Addendum, 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa-- advice for augmented care units'. The guidance's publication, in March 2013, followed the death, just over a year earlier, of three young infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Belfast's Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital (RJMH) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa-related infection, the source subsequently being identified as six handwashbasins.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697089","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.710292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.67708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.671736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.540368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.464248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"England","weight":0.455396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.341937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Plumbing","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Porton Down","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porton_Down"},{"name":"Short Belfast","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Belfast"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"HTM Personenvervoer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTM_Personenvervoer"},{"name":"Water management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_management"},{"name":"Addendum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addendum"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Frederic Moore","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Moore"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Speaker (politics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)"},{"name":"Academic conference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference"},{"name":"Porton","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porton"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"}]}
