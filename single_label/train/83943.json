{"id":83943,"title":"Cigarette smoking among adults with mobility impairments: a US population-based survey.","abstract":"Smokers with mobility impairments have greater health risks than the general population. We report the prevalence of cigarette smoking and quit attempts among people with mobility impairments.We conducted an analysis of 13,308 adults (aged 21-85 years) with mobility impairments (special ambulatory equipment and difficulty walking 0.25 miles without equipment) responding to the National Health Interview Survey (2011).Among 21- to 44-year-old adults with mobility impairments, 39.2% were smokers, compared with only 21.5% of adults without mobility impairments (odds ratio [OR]=1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07, 2.52). Among 45- to 64-year-old adults with mobility impairments, 31.2% were smokers versus 20.7% without mobility impairments (OR=1.35; 95% CI=1.09, 1.68). Women aged 21 to 44 years with mobility impairments had the highest smoking prevalence (45.9%), exceeding same-aged women without mobility impairments(18.9%; OR=2.56; 95% CI=1.32, 4.97). Men with mobility impairments had greater smoking prevalence (24.1%) than women with mobility impairments (15.1%; P<.01). Smokers with mobility impairments were less likely to attempt quitting (19.9%) than smokers without mobility impairments (27.3%; P<.01).Smokers with mobility impairments should be targeted for cessation, particularly those who are younger and female.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25208005","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.772419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.672841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.510274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.341768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.26113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/308"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Interview (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_(magazine)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"2180s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2180s"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"}]}
