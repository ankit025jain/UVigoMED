{"id":51755,"title":"Features analysis on Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.","abstract":"To study the features of the distribution and differentiation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).We collected clinical data on illness course, age, fasting blood glucose, saccharogenic hemoglobin, TCM syndromes, tongue, and pulse of 238 DPN patients. Differentiated main syndromes (Yin deficiency and exuberant heat, invasion of spleen by damp-heat, deficiency of both Qi and Yin, and deficiency of both Yin and Yang) and accompanying syndromes (blood stasis and phlegm-dampness) of diabetes were also recorded. The features of DPN syndromes were then analyzed.Among the fourmain syndromes of diabetes, deficiency of both Yin and Yang was the most common in the 238DPN patients, of which 89%-96 had blood stasis.The method of differentiating syndromes of diabetes can be applied to DPN patients. Deficiency of both Yin and Yang, often accompanied by blood stasis, is commonly seen.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660588","annotations":[{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.870352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.746624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.735177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.442665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.393227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.323815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.282036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.172483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.108091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Blood stasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_stasis"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
