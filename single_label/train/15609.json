{"id":15609,"title":"Determination of serotyping antigens, clonal analysis and genetic characterization of the 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes in invasive Neisseria meningitidis from Western Canada, 2009 to 2013.","abstract":"This study examined invasive Neisseria meningitidis recovered from invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases in Western Canada between 2009 and 2013. A total of 161 isolates from individual IMD cases were analysed for serogroup, serotype, serosubtype, PorA genotype, multi-locus sequence type and nucleotide sequence of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes. Sixty-nine isolates were serogroup B (MenB), 47 were serogroup Y (MenY), 22 were serogroup C (MenC), 19 were serogroup W (MenW), three were serogroup E and one was non-encapsulated. MenC, MenY and MenW were mainly clonal, represented primarily by clonal complex (cc) 11, cc23 or cc167, and cc22, respectively. In contrast, MenB were composed of eight different ccs together with 11 isolates not assigned to any known cc. Antigenic analysis and PorA genotyping confirmed the heterogeneity of MenB isolates, while such results supported the clonal nature of most MenC, MenY and MenW isolates. Thirty-four (21.1%) isolates had at least one gene that encoded one matching vaccine protein component of the 4CMenB vaccine (i.e. PorA P1.4; fHbp variant 1.1; NHBA peptide 2; and NadA-1, -2, or -3). An additional 18 isolates had genes that encoded variant 1 or subfamily B factor H binding proteins of this same vaccine.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25165123","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.654783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Neisseria","weight":0.558725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.497041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.397802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.344537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.30435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Meningococcal disease","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Factor H","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_H"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cubic centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
