{"id":82169,"title":"Deliberate hypotensive anesthesia with the rapidly acting, vascular-selective, L-type calcium channel antagonist-clevidipine: a case report.","abstract":"Deliberate hypotension is an important technique for use in select anesthetics for procedures such as orthognathic surgery, specifically LeFort I maxillary osteotomy. We present a case report of an anesthetic involving deliberate hypotension for a 17-year-old female patient who presented for a LeFort I osteotomy, bilateral sagittal split of the mandible, and a genioplasty in order to correct a skeletal class III malocclusion. After reaching a steady-state general anesthetic, deliberate hypotension was induced solely with a bolus and subsequent continuous infusion of the ultrashort acting calcium channel blocker, clevidipine. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative course and anesthetic management are discussed.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697821","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.810634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.799944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"General anaesthetic","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthetic"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.725667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.636749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.499437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.34931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Orthognathic surgery","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.337968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Clevidipine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clevidipine"},{"name":"Genioplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genioplasty"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Ultrashort pulse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrashort_pulse"},{"name":"Channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_blocker"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"}]}
