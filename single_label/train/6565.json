{"id":6565,"title":"Reversal by aqueous extracts of Cistanche tubulosa from behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease-like rat model: relevance for amyloid deposition and central neurotransmitter function.","abstract":"Cistanche tubulosa (Schenk) R. Wight (CT) is commonly used to treat forgetfulness by traditional Chinese physicians. This study presents the ameliorating effects of CT extract which was quantified with three phenylpropanoid glycosides in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like rat model.Amyloid ? peptide 1-42 (A? 1-42) intracisternally infused to rats by osmotic pump (Alzet 2002) was used as an AD-like rat model. The major pathological makers were measured including A? 1-42 immunohistochemical stain, behavioral tests (inhibitory avoidance task and Morris water maze) and central neurotransmitter functions.A? 1-42 caused the cognitive deficits, the increase in the amyloid deposition and acetylcholinesterase activities, and the decrease in the levels of brain's acetylcholine and dopamine. Daily administration of CT extract throughout A? 1-42 infusion periods ameliorated the cognitive deficits, decreased amyloid deposition and reversed cholinergic and hippocampal dopaminergic dysfunction caused by A? 1-42. Donepezil also ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction, but only blocked the amyloid deposition and cholinergic dysfunction caused by A? 1-42.We suggest that CT extract, containing enough echinacoside and acteoside, ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction caused by A? 1-42 via blocking amyloid deposition, reversing cholinergic and hippocampal dopaminergic neuronal function.","date":"2014-07-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968859","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase","weight":0.884591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Cholinergic","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.693938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Donepezil","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donepezil"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.573397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.435127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Morris water navigation task","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_water_navigation_task"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.394998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.379276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Cognitive deficit","weight":0.358664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Osmosis","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Maze","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Glycoside","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Forgetting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Anosognosia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
