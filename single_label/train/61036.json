{"id":61036,"title":"[Case report: unusual clinical presentation of a follicular lymphoma].","abstract":"Follicular lymphoma is an indolent B-cell lymphoma. Fluctuant asymptomatic lymphadenopathies are their usual clinical manifestation. B-cell neoplasms can sometimes involve the skin. In this case, it is important to distinguish a systemic B-cell lymphoma with secondary skin involvement from primary cutaneous lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stainings and staging usually allow to make the difference. Here we report the first case of a systemic follicular lymphoma with secondary cutaneous involvement presented with papular lesions on the face mimicking a rosacea.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772807","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.54127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.535405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Rosacea","weight":0.44179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosacea"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
