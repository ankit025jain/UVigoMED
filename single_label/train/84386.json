{"id":84386,"title":"[Controlled observation of the efficacy on motion sickness in the prevention and treatment with jianpixingnao needling therapy].","abstract":"To verify the efficacy of Jianpi-xingniao needling therapy on prevention and treatment of motion sickness.Sixty volunteers of motion sickness were randomized into an acupuncture group and a delayed acupuncture group, 30 cases in each one. In the acupuncture group, acupuncture was given at Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Neiguan (PC 6), Zusanli (ST 36) and Hegu (LI 4). The needles were retained for 20 min. The treatment was given twice a week and 10 treatments were required. In the delayed acupuncture group, acupuncture was postponed, meaning no acupuncture during observation stage. Graybel scale was adopted to observe the score of symptoms and physical signs of the subjects of motion sickness before and after intervention. The efficacy was compared between the two groups.Twenty-five cases in the acupuncture group and 22 cases in the delayed acupuncture group were included in the statistical analysis. The score of symptoms and physical signs of motion sickness was reduced significantly after treatment in the acupuncture group as compared with that before treatment (10.12 +/- 3.37 vs 0.92 +/- 0.40, P < 0.05). The score in the acupuncture group was lower apparently than that in the delayed acupuncture group (0.92 +/- 0.40 vs 9.86 +/- 2.53, P < 0.05). The difference was not significant before and after treatment in the self-comparison of the delayed acupuncture group (P > 0.05). The total effective rate was 96.0% (24/25) in the acupuncture group, which was significantly better than 0.0% (0/22) in the delayed acupuncture group (P < 0.01).Jianpixingniao needling therapy relieves the symptoms of motion sickness in the patients and achieves a better clinical efficacy.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112084","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.917265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.72345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.608052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.209928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Motion sickness","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Liberal International","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_International"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"False pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_pregnancy"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Type 024 class missile boat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_024_class_missile_boat"}]}
