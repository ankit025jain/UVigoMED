{"id":12856,"title":"Interleukin-6 receptor blockade enhances CD39+ regulatory T cell development in rheumatoid arthritis and in experimental arthritis.","abstract":"The rationale for blocking interleukin-6 (IL-6) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) lies chiefly in the proinflammatory effect of this cytokine. Few studies have evaluated the consequences of anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody treatment on Treg cells. This study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of action of anti-IL-6R antibody treatment by studying the effects on Treg cells in an experimental arthritis model and in patients with RA.Mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated with a mouse anti-IL-6R antibody (MR16-1), and changes in Treg, Th1, and Th17 cells were assessed at key time points during the course of the disease. Peripheral blood from 15 RA patients was collected on day 0 and after 3 months of tocilizumab treatment for flow cytometry analysis of Th17 and Treg cells.In MR16-1-treated mice, Th17 cell frequencies were unchanged, whereas Treg cell frequencies were increased. The Treg cell phenotype showed marked changes, with an increase in the frequency of CD39+ Treg cells in the lymph nodes and spleen. Interestingly, similar CD39+ Treg cell expansion was observed in RA patients who were tocilizumab responders at 3 months, with no change in Th17 cell frequency. Moreover, fluorescence-activated cell-sorted CD39+ Treg cells from responder RA patients were functionally able to suppress the proliferation of conventional T cells.In both CIA and RA, the frequency of functionally suppressive CD39+ Treg cells is increased as a result of anti-IL-6R treatment, whereas Th17 cells are unaffected. The modification of Treg cell frequency and phenotype may be one of the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effect of IL-6 blockade in RA.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504799","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.871282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.731063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.51131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Interleukin-6 receptor","weight":0.441888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin-6_receptor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Tocilizumab","weight":0.191559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocilizumab"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0880793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0337327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0303278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
