{"id":45962,"title":"A single institution's experience with surgical cytoreduction of stage IV, well-differentiated, small bowel neuroendocrine tumors.","abstract":"Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract are rare, slow-growing neoplasms. Clinical outcomes in a group of stage IV, well-differentiated patients with NETs with small bowel primaries undergoing cytoreductive surgery and multidisciplinary management at a single center were evaluated.The charts of 189 consecutive patients who underwent surgical cytoreduction for their small bowel NETs were reviewed. Information on the extent of disease, complications, and Kaplan-Meier survival were collected from the patient records.A total of 189 patients underwent 229 cytoreductive operations. Ten percent of patients required an intraoperative blood transfusion and 3% (6 of 229) had other intraoperative complications. For all 229 procedures performed, mean (± SD) stay in the ICU was 4 ± 3 days and in the hospital was 9 ± 10 days. Before discharge, 51% of patients had no postoperative complications and 39% of patients had only minor complications. In a 30-day follow-up period from discharge, 85% of patients had no additional complications and 13% had only minor complications. The 30-day postoperative death rate was 3% (5 of 189). Mean survival from histologic diagnosis of NET was 236 months. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year Kaplan-Meier survival rates from diagnosis were 87%, 77%, and 41%, respectively.Cytoreductive surgery in patients with well-differentiated midgut NETs has low mortality and complication rates and is associated with prolonged survival. We believe that cytoreductive surgery is a key component in the care of patients with NETs.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655881","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.670587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.598141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.489611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.476714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.414997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Midgut","weight":0.288641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgut"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.0628012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
