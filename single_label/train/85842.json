{"id":85842,"title":"[Omental hernia through esophageal hiatus simulates mediastinal lipomatous tumor].","abstract":"Omental hernia through the esophageal hiatus is extemely infrequent. Paraesophageal hiatal hernia with omentum in the herniary sac mimics a mediastinal lipomatous tumor and differential diagnosis should be made. This diagnosis requires experience and knowledge of the differences between these two pathologies. In the following study we describe the case of an omental hernia and the characteristics that make it different from other pathologies.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847629","annotations":[{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.652751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.279122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Greater omentum","weight":0.262158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.171124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.164056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.108378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Esophageal hiatus","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_hiatus"},{"name":"Hiatus hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_hernia"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"}]}
