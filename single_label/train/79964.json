{"id":79964,"title":"Ecological and epidemiological aspects of the sand fly (Diptera, Psychodidae) fauna of the National Monument of Pontões Capixabas, State of Espírito Santo, Southeastern Brazil.","abstract":"We evaluated the ecological and epidemiological aspects of the sand fly fauna in an area of the Atlantic Forest biome with records of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Sand fly collections at three different localities at the National Monument of Pontões Capixabas, State of Espírito Santo, Southeastern Brazil, were conducted by using two Centers of Disease Control and Prevention automatic light traps in the peridomiciliary environment and eight Centers of Disease Control and Prevention automatic light traps in the forested environment. Collections occurred during four consecutive nights within each of the months and locations: São Luiz (December 2009, May 2010, July 2010, and December 2010), Córrego Palmital de Baixo (September 2010 and October 2010), and Córrego São Bento (February 2011 and May 2011). We collected 21,138 sand flies belonging to 31 species and 14 genera. Of this total, 12,412 sand flies were captured in the peridomiciliary environment and 8,726 in the forested environment. All of the vector species, Lutzomyia longipalpis (=Lutzomyia longipalpis, sensu; Young and Duncan), Migonemyia migonei (=Lutzomyia migonei, sensu; Young and Duncan), and Nyssomyia intermedia (=Lutzomyia intermedia, sensu; Young and Duncan), occurred in significantly higher numbers in the peridomiciliary environment than compared with the forested environment. Our results highlight the importance of conservation in the forest remains of the National Monument of Pontões Capixabas, because of higher species richness and diversity. Furthermore, they indicate the epidemiological role of Lu. longipalpis as the vector of Leishmania infantum within the study area, and the no evident role of Mg. migonei.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843925","annotations":[{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Biome","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome"},{"name":"Fly","weight":0.828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Fauna","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.799238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.654949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.503229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.481336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sandfly","weight":0.479472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandfly"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.399122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Atlantic Forest","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Forest"},{"name":"Forest","weight":0.354556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Sand","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.304946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Species richness","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_richness"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Atlantic Ocean","weight":0.219821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.187497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Conservation biology","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology"},{"name":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Psychodidae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodidae"},{"name":"Leishmania infantum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania_infantum"},{"name":"Lutzomyia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutzomyia"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Sensu","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensu"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Fish trap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_trap"},{"name":"Human settlement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_settlement"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"}]}
