{"id":81584,"title":"Case history: improved maxillary growth and development following digit sucking elimination and orofacial myofunctional therapy.","abstract":"Orofacial myologists are frequently called upon to address retained oral habit concerns. During this process, current I.A.O.M. recommended treatment includes addressing tongue, lip, and jaw rest posture concerns. Following digit sucking remediation, we may also be called upon to address these rest posture issues, and tongue thrust more aggressively together. In this process, facial growth and development and jaw structure may coincidentally improve as a result of 'nature taking its course' by addressing both swallow AND rest posture. In a select subset of clients, dramatic improvements may occur if the timing is right. This article discusses one such case that appears to have yielded a significant improvement in oral postures influencing improved facial and oral growth and development.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946661","annotations":[{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.553642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.531579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.52293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.385964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.260921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.138135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0415314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Thrust","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Environmental remediation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_remediation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"}]}
