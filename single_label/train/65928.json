{"id":65928,"title":"SLCO1B1, SLCO2B1, and SLCO1B3 polymorphisms and susceptibility to bladder cancer risk.","abstract":"A variety of carcinogens are excreted in urine and may be actively transported by organic anion-transporting polypeptides that encoded by SLCOs. In this study, we evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLCO1B1, SLCO2B1, and SLCO1B3 are associated with bladder cancer susceptibility. Our results, for the first time, indicated that polymorphisms of SLCO1B1 rs2306283 might be associated with bladder cancer risk. Therefore, SNPs in SLCO1B1 may be potential biomarkers for assessing the risk of bladder cancer.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762081","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.436965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Active transport","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transport"},{"name":"Niacin","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Penal transportation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_transportation"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"First baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"5-HT2B receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2B_receptor"}]}
