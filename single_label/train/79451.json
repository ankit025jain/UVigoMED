{"id":79451,"title":"Non-syndromic hereditary sensorineural hearing loss: review of the genes involved.","abstract":"Hereditary sensorineural hearing loss is the most frequently occurring birth defect. It has profound effects for the individual and is a substantial burden on society. Insight into disease mechanisms can help to broaden therapeutic options and considerably lower lifetime social costs. In the past few decades, the identification of genes that can cause this type of hearing loss has developed rapidly.This paper provides a concise overview of the currently known genes involved in non-syndromic hereditary hearing loss and their function in the inner ear.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423691","annotations":[{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.927519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.821849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.567093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.527552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.463821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inner ear","weight":0.183691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.162801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Social cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cost"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Nonsyndromic deafness","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsyndromic_deafness"}]}
