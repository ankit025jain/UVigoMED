{"id":77590,"title":"MetLife and its corporate allies: dust diseases and the manipulation of science.","abstract":"The dust diseases silicosis and asbestosis were the first occupational diseases to have widespread impact on workers. Knowledge that asbestos and silica were hazardous to health became public long after the industry knew of the health concerns. This delay was largely influenced by the interests of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife).To understand how MetLife influenced the science and politics of asbestos and silica exposure in the first half of the twentieth century.We examined previously secret corporate documents produced in litigation, deposition, and trial testimony, as well as published scholarship.MetLife established itself as an authority in public and industrial health in the early part of the twentieth century, gaining the trust of the public and government. They were able to use this trust and authority to avoid financial loss, including the firing of sick workers, and avoid legal liability by organizing a network of experts to testify on their behalf in silica- and asbestos-related damage suits. They further manipulated the results of scientific findings from major research institutions, delaying important knowledge about the asbestos-cancer relationship. They also influenced law and public policy through writing and implementing worker compensation laws in numerous states and concocting an arbitrary \"protective\" standard to monitor asbestos exposure. This standard was known by MetLife to not protect against disease.The actions of MetLife and its allies had real human and scientific consequences and an effect on the industry lasting until now.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Occupational
