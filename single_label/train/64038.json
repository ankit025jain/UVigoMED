{"id":64038,"title":"Sublingual (SLIT) versus oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergy.","abstract":"Food allergy is a common condition for which the only currently approved treatments are avoidance of the allergenic food and the administration of emergency medications upon accidental exposure. Over the past 10 years, significant advances have been made in the field of food immunotherapy, with efforts focusing on allergen exposure via the oral mucosa. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) are the two modalities that have been most extensively studied, and this article will review recent advances in our knowledge of the efficacy and safety of these treatments.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25297805","annotations":[{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.686834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.674363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.56664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.484428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.291208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.26538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
