{"id":47467,"title":"The interaction effects of pri-let-7a-1 rs10739971 with PGC and ERCC6 gene polymorphisms in gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction effects of pri-let-7a-1 rs10739971 with pepsinogen C (PGC) and excision repair cross complementing group 6 (ERCC6) gene polymorphisms and its association with the risks of gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis. We hoped to identify miRNA polymorphism or a combination of several polymorphisms that could serve as biomarkers for predicting the risk of gastric cancer and its precancerous diseases.Sequenom MassARRAY platform method was used to detect polymorphisms of pri-let-7a-1 rs10739971 G ? A, PGC rs4711690 C ? G, PGC rs6458238 G ? A, PGC rs9471643 G ? C, and ERCC6 rs1917799 in 471 gastric cancer patients, 645 atrophic gastritis patients and 717 controls.An interaction effect of pri-let-7a-1 rs10739971 polymorphism with ERCC6 rs1917799 polymorphism was observed for the risk of gastric cancer (P interaction?=?0.026); and interaction effects of pri-let-7a-1 rs10739971 polymorphism with PGC rs6458238 polymorphism (P interaction?=?0.012) and PGC rs9471643 polymorphism (P interaction?=?0.039) were observed for the risk of atrophic gastritis.The combination of pri-let-7a-1 rs10739971 polymorphism and ERCC6 and PGC polymorphisms could provide a greater prediction potential than a single polymorphism on its own. Large-scale studies and molecular mechanism research are needed to confirm our findings.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586594","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.703719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.606261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.4571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Pepsin","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsin"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.385854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Atrophic gastritis","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophic_gastritis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"ERCC6","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCC6"},{"name":"Sequenom","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequenom"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"645","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/645"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Interaction (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics)"},{"name":"A1 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_(band)"},{"name":"Principal Galaxies Catalogue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_Galaxies_Catalogue"},{"name":"Excision repair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excision_repair"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Group 6 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_6_element"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
