{"id":58893,"title":"MicroRNA and implantation.","abstract":"We provide a review of microRNA (miRNA) related to human implantation which shows the potential diagnostic role of miRNAs in impaired endometrial receptivity, altered embryo development, implantation failure after assisted reproduction technology, and in ectopic pregnancy and pregnancies of unknown location. MicroRNAs may be emerging diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic tools for understanding implantation disorders. However, further research is needed before miRNAs can be used in clinical practice for identifying and treating implantation failure.
