{"id":54236,"title":"Insulin degludec's ultra-long pharmacokinetic properties observed in adults are retained in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a basal insulin with an ultra-long pharmacokinetic profile in adults that at steady-state produces remarkably flat and stable insulin levels; however, no studies have yet reported on the pharmacokinetic properties of IDeg in subjects younger than 18?years of age. This was a single-centre, randomised, single-dose, double-blind, two-period crossover trial conducted in children (6-11?years), adolescents (12-17?years), and adults (18-65?years) with type 1 diabetes. Subjects received a single subcutaneous dose of 0.4?U/kg IDeg or insulin glargine (IGlar), respectively, on two separate dosing visits, with pharmacokinetic blood sampling up to 72-h postdose. A total of 37 subjects (12 children, 13 adolescents, and 12 adults) completed the trial. Total exposure of IDeg after a single dose (AUCIDeg ,0-?, SD ) was higher in children compared to adults [estimated ratio children/adults 1.48 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.98; 2.24)] and in adolescents compared to adults [estimated ratio adolescents/adults 1.33 (95% CI: 1.08; 1.64)]; however, the difference was only statistically significant for the latter comparison. No statistically significant difference in maximum concentration of IDeg (Cmax, IDeg , SD ) was observed. Estimated ratios for Cmax, IDeg , SD were (children/adults) 1.20 (95% CI: 0.90; 1.60) and (adolescents/adults) 1.23 (95% CI: 1.00; 1.51). Simulated mean steady state pharmacokinetic profiles supported a flat and stable IDeg exposure across a 24-h dosing interval. IDeg was detectable in serum for at least 72?h (end of blood sampling period) in all subjects following single dose. In conclusion, the ultra-long pharmacokinetic properties of IDeg observed in adults are preserved in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467565","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.611475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.493394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.458397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.255407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.139537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Steady state","weight":0.125146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0898588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Insulin glargine","weight":0.0627764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_glargine"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"1865","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1865"},{"name":"1217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1217"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sampling rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_rate"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Etendue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Cmax (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmax_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Basal rate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_rate"}]}
