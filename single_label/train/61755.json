{"id":61755,"title":"[The network between hematological centers for the standardization of myelodysplastic syndromes diagnosis].","abstract":"A network of hematological centers specialized in the study of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) may be a useful tool for the standardization of the diagnosis of this heterogeneous group of hematologic syndromes and possibly provide not only biological but also epidemiological information. In each center included in the network the diagnosis of MDS will be performed according to criteria of WHO 2008 classification and the last recommendations published by European LeukemiaNet in 2013. In detail the following analyses will be carried out: morphological examination, bone marrow biopsy, conventional cytogenetic and possibly molecular cytogenetic studies. In each region will be identified a reference center that will collect data on all patients with suspected MDS creating a database with clinical, morphological and molecular-cytogenetic information. In particular, the morphological evaluation will be carried out in collaboration between the peripheral centers and the regional reference center through the sharing of images from slides. The collaboration between experts hematologists will allow the formulation of more precise diagnosis. Moreover, the national network for the standardization of MDS diagnosis could facilitate the ideation of new research projects and the identification of new prognostic markers.
