{"id":15284,"title":"Treatment outcome of tuberculosis patients in a clinic of Bangalore.","abstract":"A total of 112 cases (New = 101, previously treated = 11) were diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis (TB) at a private clinic in Bangalore city. The clinic identified TB suspects, established diagnosis of TB, administered direct observation of treatment (DOT), maintained treatment cards and undertook defaulter retrieval actions as and when required. The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) provided support in terms of sputum microscopy supply of patient-wise drug boxes and registration of patients. Ninety six (95.1%) of new cases and 10 (90.9%) of previously treated cases had successful treatment outcome. Most patients completed treatment within the prescribed period. No TB deaths were reported during the period of treatment.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241566","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.521646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.368379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.168791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Bangalore","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore"},{"name":"Playing card","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card"},{"name":"Default (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)"},{"name":"Private investigator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Licensure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensure"}]}
