{"id":56723,"title":"[Ultrastructural features of vascular iridociliary system after biopuncture by antihomotoxic medicine].","abstract":"To reveal ultrastructural features of iridociliary vessels after biopuncture with antihomotoxic medicine.Myopia model was created on 10 rabbits by injecting all trans-retinoic acid in catheter Vasofix Certo 24G in left internal carotid artery until we got low myopia. After six months of daily injections all rabbits had myopia from -2,0 to 3,0 D. Animals were separated into two groups: 5 rabbits with daily intradermal injection in three points of upper eye lid without medicine during 10 days and 5 rabbits with daily intradermal injection in three points of upper eye lid with Cerebrum Compositum N during 10 days. Morphology of iridociliary system was explored.Biopuncture in myopia model increases level of metabolic reactions in iridociliary system, supplies adaptive reserves by the hemodynamic enrichment of ciliary body vessels and balance of autonomic nervous system impulsation.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640776","annotations":[{"name":"Internal carotid artery","weight":0.886224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.833773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.77778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.48904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.473821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Ciliary body","weight":0.341284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliary_body"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.332822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.305461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.271284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Anatomical pathology","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_pathology"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
