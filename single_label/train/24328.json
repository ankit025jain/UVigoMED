{"id":24328,"title":"Readmissions after diagnosis of surgical site infection following knee and hip arthroplasty.","abstract":"Surgical site infection (SSI) after total hip and knee arthroplasty is a common postoperative complication. We sought to determine readmission rates and costs for total hip and knee arthroplasty complicated by SSI.The Thomson Reuters MarketScan database was searched for patients who underwent knee or hip arthroplasty in 2007. From these data, patients who received a diagnosis of SSI and were readmitted after diagnosis were identified.A population of 31 to 45 million individuals receiving insurance coverage. Patients who underwent knee or hip arthroplasty who experienced a hospitalization for SSI in the year after surgery were analyzed.Total readmission rates and costs per readmission at 30, 60, and 90 days and 1 year after diagnosis of SSI.Of the 76,289 case patients with hip or knee replacement in 2007, 1,026 (1.3%) had a hospitalization for SSI within the year after surgery. Among these patients, 310 (30.2%) were subsequently rehospitalized in the year after initial hospitalization specifically due to SSI-related issues. These rehospitalizations were associated with a mean hospital stay of [Formula: see text] days and a median cost of $20,001 (interquartile range [IQR], $14,057-$30,551). A total of 517 subjects had a subsequent \"all-cause\" hospitalization during the year after SSI. These rehospitalizations were associated with a mean hospital stay of [Formula: see text] days and a median cost of $19,870 (IQR, $13,913-$29,728).Readmissions during the year after SSI diagnosis accounted for 1,072 hospital admissions and cost over $25.5 million. These readmissions are costly and might be a future target for decreased reimbursement.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442077","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.455505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.45399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Reuters","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.297819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Thomson Reuters","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"870","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/870"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"11th millennium and beyond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_millennium_and_beyond"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Reimbursement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reimbursement"}]}
