{"id":80824,"title":"Severe falciparum malaria associated with massive pulmonary embolism.","abstract":"Falciparum malaria is known to cause alterations in the coagulation cascade, including disseminated intravascular coagulation. Microthrombotic complications are the best described; however, a number of cases of thrombosis involving larger vessels have been published in the literature. Herein, we describe the case of a woman with malaria associated with massive pulmonary embolism.
