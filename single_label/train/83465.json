{"id":83465,"title":"[Perioperative risk assessment tailored to elderly patients].","abstract":"Proper preparation of the patient for surgery has a crucial impact on the outcome. Due to the continuous increase in life expectancy more and more often the problem of proper perioperative preparation of the patients over 65 years of age burdened with a higher risk of perioperative complications is undertaken. Proper assessment of the health condition and physical capacity allows to optimize treatment and thus minimize the risk of complications. In many countries, the recommended procedure is to perform the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), which, however, due to the need to carry out a number of additional diagnostic tests and consultations is too expensive for the vast majority of hospitals. Therefore the search for more convenient methods of abbreviated assessment is undertaken, the methods that will identify patients at greatest risk of complications. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment includes a series of tests and scales assessing, interalia, cognitive functions, motor efficiency, dependency, nutrition and mood. Applied abbreviated methods of perioperative assessment also have limitations in predicting the course of hospitalization. So far, there is no general practice guidelines for patients over 65 years of age. But it seems reasonable to perform the CGA in case of an unfavorable outcome of abbreviated assessment or when the threat of frailty syndrome is suspected. This procedure enables to select the best method of treatment, the implementation of appropriate prevention, thus improving the outcome of treatment and quality of life.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345282","annotations":[{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Frailty syndrome","weight":0.734979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frailty_syndrome"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.255994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.129516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Acronym and initialism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}]}
