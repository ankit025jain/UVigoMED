{"id":84543,"title":"The effect of leg length discrepancy upon load distribution in the static phase (standing).","abstract":"Leg length discrepancy (LLD) is commonly recognised as a complication of total hip arthroplasty. Some patients with only minor LLD complain of major difficulties. The effect of LLD has been described in the dynamic phase, but not static phase. The aim of this project was to investigate the effect of leg length discrepancy on static limb loading (i.e. Standing). A pedobarograph was used to measure the limb loading of 20 normal volunteers whilst changing the height of the other foot thus simulating a LLD. With both feet at the same level, the left limb took 54% of the load. When the right foot was lower, (simulating a long left leg), the left leg took 39% of the load. When the right foot was higher, (simulating a long right leg), the left leg took 65% of the load. A paired t-test comparison of the simulation with the level load showed a significant difference with P=0.002. Our results show that weight distribution increased in the shorter limb when LLD was simulated. This uneven distribution is likely to lead to premature fatigue when standing and may explain why some patients with LLD post hip arthroplasty have poorer outcomes.
