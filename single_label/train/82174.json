{"id":82174,"title":"CT features and pathologic characteristics of lymphoepithelial carcinoma of salivary glands.","abstract":"To investigate and analyze the typical CT findings of salivary gland lymphoepithelial carcinoma.CT findings in 8 patients with lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) in salivary gland were studied retrospectively. Surgical resection was performed in all cases.8 cases were subdivided to primary tumor and secondary tumor. In primary tumor group, 5 were localized in the parotid gland, 2 were found in the submandibular glands; 6 lesions had with homogeneous density, 1 was associated with cystic degeneration and 1 with calcification; the margins of lesions in 5 cases were poorly defined, while well-defined in 2. On enhanced CT: obvious enhancement was achieved in all of the 7 solitary lesions, among which 4 were homogenously enhanced while the other 3 had heterogeneous enhancement. In the 2 cases of nodules in deep lobe, retromandibular vein was affected; 7 patients had positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) test, with Ki-67 measurements ranged from 40% to 80%. 1 patient had LEC secondary to Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion (BLEL), with involvement of bilateral parotid glands; the lesion was manifested as multiple differently-sized nodules, with partial cystic change, all of the nodules had clear margins, and obvious ring-shape enhancement was seen in the nodules with cystic change; the patient with secondary LEC had negative EBV test and a Ki-67 value of 20%.In most cases, LEC was primary and occurred in the parotid glands. The probable diagnosis could be made based upon Dual-phase contrast-enhanced CT scan findings combined with positive expression of EBV.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696717","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.86265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.808084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.577114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.417046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.353049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.147309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Submandibular gland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submandibular_gland"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"}]}
