{"id":82191,"title":"Sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, regulates Lymphangiogenic factors in oral cancer cell line HSC-3.","abstract":"Tumor angiogenesis is a focus of molecularly-targeted therapies. This study investigated the effect of sodium butyrate (SB), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on the synthesis of antiangiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors in oral squamous cell carcinoma.Gene alterations in HSC-3 cells were assessed using cDNA microarrays before and after treatment with SB. The mRNA and protein expression of lymphangiogenic factors were also assessed by quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunocytochemistry.Microarray analysis revealed that treatment with SB led to altered expression of angiogenesis-related gene expression. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that platelet-derived growth factor-B, angiopoietin-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, and VEGFD were down-regulated. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed reduced protein synthesis of VEGFC.SB inhibits expression of lymphangiogenic factors in HSC-3 cells. Within the limitations of the present study, SB may have potential as an anti-metastatic pro-drug for oral cancer.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Stomatognathic
