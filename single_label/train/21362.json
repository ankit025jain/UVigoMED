{"id":21362,"title":"Potent bactericidal efficacy of copper oxide impregnated non-porous solid surfaces.","abstract":"The role of fomites and the environment in nosocomial infections is becoming widely recognized. In this paper we discuss the use of Cupron copper oxide impregnated non-porous solid surface in the hospital setting and present in vitro testing data via USA Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved testing protocols that demonstrate the efficacy of these products to assist in reduction in environmental contamination and potentially nosocomial infections.The two countertops tested passed all the acceptance criteria by the EPA (>99.9% kill within 2 hours of exposure) killing a range of bacterial pathogens on the surface of the countertops even after repeated exposure of the countertops to the pathogen, and multiple wet and dry abrasion cycles.Cupron enhanced EOS countertops thus may be an important adjunct to be used in hospital settings to reduce environmental bioburden and potentially nosocomial infections.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606672","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.740667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"United States Environmental Protection Agency","weight":0.630434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.616713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.425618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.416002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.413535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.3065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.279552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.230134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dry season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Countertop","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countertop"},{"name":"Fomite","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite"}]}
