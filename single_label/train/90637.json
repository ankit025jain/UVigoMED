{"id":90637,"title":"The association between demographic and behavioral characteristics and sunburn among U.S. adults - National Health Interview Survey, 2010.","abstract":"To examine the association between demographic and behavioral characteristics and sunburn among U.S. adults.We used 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (N=24,970) to conduct multivariable logistic regressions examining associations with having 1 or more sunburns in the past year and having 4 or more sunburns in the past year.Overall, 37.1% of adults experienced sunburn in the past year. The adjusted prevalence of sunburn was particularly common among adults aged 18-29years (52.0%), those who repeatedly burn or freckle after 2weeks in the sun (45.9%), whites (44.3%), indoor tanners (44.1%), those with a family history of melanoma (43.9%), and those who are US-born (39.5%). Physical activity, alcohol consumption, and overweight/obesity were positively associated with sunburn (all P<0.001); sun protection behaviors were not significantly associated with sunburn (P=0.35). Among those who were sunburned in the past year, 12.1% experienced 4 or more sunburns.Sunburn is common, particularly among younger adults, those with a more sun-sensitive skin type, whites, those with a family history of melanoma, the highly physically active, and indoor tanners. Efforts are needed to facilitate sun-safety during outdoor recreation, improve the consistency of sun protection practices, and prevent sunburn, particularly among these subgroups.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589442","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.725549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.64342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.616108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.313812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.309541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Sunburn","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn"},{"name":"Human skin color","weight":0.199429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.0585202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Freckle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freckle"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1829","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1829"},{"name":"970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/970"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Sunscreen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Channel 37","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_37"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Outdoor recreation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outdoor_recreation"},{"name":"44,100 Hz","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz"},{"name":"Tanning","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
