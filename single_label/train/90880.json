{"id":90880,"title":"Where the PIP is the implant?","abstract":"A 51-year-old woman, who had previous breast augmentation and a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection of the lung, underwent breast implant replacement of Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) due to a loss of volume on the right side of the chest. During this procedure, no implant was found in the right subpectoral space; however, a large defect was observed in the fifth intercostal space. A computed tomography scan of the chest indicated a circular entity in the right pleural cavity, which was confirmed to be the lost implant during a subsequent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).
