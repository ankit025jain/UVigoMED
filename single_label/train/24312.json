{"id":24312,"title":"Increasing use of third-generation cephalosporins for pneumonia in the emergency department: may some prescriptions be avoided?","abstract":"Third-generation cephalosporins are used to treat inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. Some of these prescriptions may be avoided, i.e. replaced by agents less likely to promote ESBL-mediated resistance. Our objectives were to assess the recent trend of third-generation cephalosporins use for pneumonia in the emergency department, and the proportion of avoidable prescriptions. This was a retrospective study of patients treated for community-acquired pneumonia in an emergency department, and subsequently hospitalized in non ICU wards. Third-generation cephalosporin prescriptions were presumed unavoidable if they met both criteria: (i) age???65 yr or comorbid condition, and (ii) allergy or intolerance to penicillin, or failure of penicillin first-line therapy, or treatment with penicillin in three previous months. Prescriptions were otherwise deemed avoidable. The proportion of patients treated with a third generation cephalosporin increased significantly from 13.9 % (6.9-24.1 %) in 2002 to 29.5 % (18.5-42.6 %) in 2012 (OR?=?1.07 [1.01-1.14] , P?=?0.02). This increase was independent from other factors associated with the prescription of a third-generation cephalosporin (immunocompromising condition, antibacterial therapy in three previous months, fluid resuscitation and REA-ICU class). Treatment with third-generation cephalosporin was avoidable in 118 out of 147 patients (80.3 % [72.7-86.2 %]). On day 7 after admission in the ED, treatment with third-generation cephalosporins was stopped or de-escalated in, respectively, 17 % and 32 % of patients. Antibiotic stewardship programs should be implemented to restrict the third-generation cephalosporins use for pneumonia in the emergency department.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442608","annotations":[{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.631501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.585396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.538962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.455405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.245291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.122269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"786","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/786"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"924","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/924"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Stewardship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}]}
