{"id":44116,"title":"The usefulness of transient elastography in the assessment of patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B virus infection.","abstract":"Histological severity is often mandatory for the management of HBeAg-negative chronic HBV patients. We evaluated the performance of transient elastography (TE) in this setting. We included 357 untreated HBeAg-negative patients with ? 1 reliable liver stiffness measurement (LSM-kPa) by TE: 182 inactive carriers with HBV-DNA < 2000 (n = 139) or 2000-19 999 IU/mL (n = 43) and 175 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In carriers, HBV-DNA > 2000 and/or LSM > 6.5 were considered as biopsy indications. LSMs did not differ between carriers with low and high viremia, but were lower in carriers than in patients with CHB (5.8 ± 1.7 vs 9.0 ± 5.6, P < 0.001) offering moderate differentiation between these two groups (AUROC: 0.705). LSMs did not change significantly in carriers after 16 (12-24) months. In carriers with a liver biopsy, Ishak's staging scores were similar between cased with low and high viremia but higher in cases with LSM > 6.5 than ? 6.5 kPa. Moderate fibrosis (stages: 2-3) was detected in 0/10 carriers with only HBV-DNA > 2000 IU/mL, 2/10 (20%) carriers with only LSM > 6.5 and 5/10 (50%) carriers with both HBV-DNA > 2000 and LSM > 6.5 (P = 0.009). In patients with CHB, LSMs correlated significantly with grading and staging scores and offered excellent accuracy for ? moderate, ? severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (AUROC ? 0.919-0.950). TE can be helpful for the noninvasive assessment of HBeAg-negative chronic HBV patients. In conclusion, LSMs offer excellent accuracy for fibrosis severity in HBeAg-negative patients with CHB and can identify carriers with high risk of moderate fibrosis, which may be present in up to 35% of carriers with LSM > 6.5 kPa and 50% of carriers with LSM > 6.5 kPa and HBV-DNA > 2000 IU/mL.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750382","annotations":[{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.551531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Elastography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"1224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1224"},{"name":"705","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/705"},{"name":"950","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/950"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"357","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/357"},{"name":"Interexchange carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interexchange_carrier"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Tight end","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Charlotte Bobcats","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bobcats"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Migrant worker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Landing Ship Medium","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Ship_Medium"}]}
