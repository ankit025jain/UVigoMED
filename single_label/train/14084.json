{"id":14084,"title":"Blockade of IL-33/ST2 ameliorates airway inflammation in a murine model of allergic asthma.","abstract":"Interleukin (IL)-33 is involved in the development of lung inflammation by inducing or amplifying Th2 type-mediated responses in various animal models of allergic asthma. The ST2 gene is a member of the IL-1 receptor family, producing a transmembrane form (ST2L) and a soluble secreted form (sST2). sST2 has been shown to block this IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether anti-IL-33 and sST2 reduced airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma.BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA), and the effect of sST2 and anti-IL-33 antibody on airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was evaluated. Furthermore, we measured changes in various cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid when treated with sST2 or anti-IL-33.We observed that anti-IL-33 antibody and sST2 exert a negative regulation on OVA-mediated allergic airway inflammation. Both treatments reduced total cell counts and eosinophil counts in BAL fluid and AHR to methacholine. The Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in BAL fluid were also significantly decreased after both treatments. However, there were no changes in the level of TGF- ÃŸ1 and IL-10 after each treatment.These results suggest that anti-IL-33 as well as sST2 have therapeutic potential for allergic asthma through inhibition of Th2 cytokine production.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446582","annotations":[{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.873709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.836127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.700863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Transmembrane protein","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.459808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.456424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.431909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Ovalbumin","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovalbumin"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.339239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.17995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
