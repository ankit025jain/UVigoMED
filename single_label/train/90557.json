{"id":90557,"title":"[Spinal anesthesia using a low dose of isobaric bupivacaine in a patient with pulmonary artery hypertension and mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease undergoing repeated femoral fracture surgery].","abstract":"A 75-year-old woman with primary pulmonary hypertension was on medical therapy and ambulatory oxygen inhalation therapy for 7 years. The patient had right femoral fracture and was admitted to our hospital. She had also suffered from asthma for 2 years, and her vital capacity was 1.35 l with forced expiratory volume in 1 second 0.79 l, and with her mean pulmonary artery pressure 60 mmHg. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed under spinal anesthesia using isobaric bupivacaine 6 mg with fentanyl 10 microg, and the patient was discharged on postoperative 31 day with no major complications. One year after the surgery, she had left femoral fracture, and surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia using isobaric bupivacaine 6 mg with fentanyl 10 microg. With its minimal effects on hemodynamics, we speculate that spinal anesthesia using a low dose of isobaric bupivacaine can be a choice for patients with pulmonary hypertension.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601108","annotations":[{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.911686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.793752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Respiratory therapy","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_therapy"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.55285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.40854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.401116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Restrictive lung disease","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery pressure","weight":0.200755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery_pressure"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.183897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.18188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Spinal anaesthesia","weight":0.152918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Bupivacaine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupivacaine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Speculation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"}]}
