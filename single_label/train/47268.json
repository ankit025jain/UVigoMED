{"id":47268,"title":"[Chemotherapy].","abstract":"Chemotherapy for colorectal cancer has improved greatly and survival rate is improving. Now, we have many effective but toxic regimens (FOLFOX, CapeOX, FOLFIRI, FOLFOXIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab or panitumumab) and regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, can be used for third- or forth-line treatment. Treatments should be tailored to an individual patient according to tumor characteristics and patient conditions. Conversion therapy is secondary surgery after most active induction chemotherapy, e.g., FOLFOX with cetuximab. Conversion rate is about 10%. Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated for stage III patients. 5FU+LV, UFT+LV, capecitabine, FOLFOX, CapeOX and S-1 are available in the adjuvant setting. Regimens including oxaliplatin should be prescribed to high-risk stage III patients, because of oxaliplatin toxicity.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597356","annotations":[{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"FOLFOX","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOLFOX"},{"name":"Cetuximab","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetuximab"},{"name":"Panitumumab","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panitumumab"},{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"FOLFIRI","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOLFIRI"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.528692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.401324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.396713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.358284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Conversion therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
