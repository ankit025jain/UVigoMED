{"id":63145,"title":"MDR1 expression predicts outcome of Ph+ chronic phase CML patients on second-line nilotinib therapy after imatinib failure.","abstract":"In the face of competing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), identification of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients expecting favorable response to second-line treatment is warranted. At the time of imatinib resistance, the investigation of multidrug-resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and BCR-ABL yielded the following results: (i) Patients with high MDR1 transcript levels showed superior response at 48 months as compared with low-level MDR1 patients: major molecular response (MMR) in 41% vs 16% (P=0.014), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 58% vs 39% (P=0.044), and progression-free survival (PFS) in 67% vs 46% (P=0.032). (ii) Patients with BCR-ABL(IS) <28% achieved higher MMR rates (48% vs 21%, P=0.009). (iii) PFS at 48 months was associated with in vitro resistance of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations: 63% (no mutation) vs 61% (sensitive, intermediately sensitive or unknown IC50 (median inhibitory concentration)) vs 23% (resistant, P=0.01). (iv) Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions 1236 and 2677 were associated with higher MDR1 expression in comparison to wild type. (v) Nilotinib was able to impede proliferation of MDR1-overexpressing imatinib-resistant cells. High MDR1 gene expression might identify patients whose mode of imatinib resistance is essentially determined by increased efflux activity of MDR1 and therefore can be overcome by second-line nilotinib treatment.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472814","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.879672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.562498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.559619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.55789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.262983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.127401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Nilotinib","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilotinib"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Efflux (microbiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efflux_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"}]}
