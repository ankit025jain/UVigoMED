{"id":85712,"title":"Approaches to outcome assessment in pulmonary rehabilitation.","abstract":"A comprehensive assessment is the foundation of a successful pulmonary rehabilitation programme. There is a broad selection of outcome measures that tend to be categorized into measures of exercise performance (including measures of strength) quality of life (health status), psychological well-being, nutritional status and more recently knowledge and self-efficacy. There is a growing interest in the measurement of physical activity too, although this is a current line of research activity. A sophisticated suite of outcomes allows the rehabilitation program to be personalised to the individual and deliver effective rehabilitation.
