{"id":62692,"title":"Age-time risk patterns of solid cancers in 60 901 non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors from Finland, Norway and Sweden.","abstract":"Survival after non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has increased thanks to improved treatment but NHL survivors have an increased risk of second neoplasms. The assessment of cancer risk patterns after NHL may help to quantify the late side-effects of therapy. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and absolute incidence rates for nine solid tumours based on a nationwide cohort of 60 901 NHL survivors from Finland, Norway and Sweden. Patients were diagnosed between 1980 and 2006 and developed 6815 s neoplasms. NHL patients showed an increased risk of each of the nine investigated cancer sites: prostate and pancreas (both RRs 1·28), breast (1·37), colorectum (1·48), urinary bladder (1·52), stomach and lung (both RRs 1·87), skin (melanoma 2·27) and kidney (2·56). The RRs showed a U-shaped relationship with time after NHL for all nine-second cancer types. NHL diagnosis early in life was a risk factor for the development of second cancers with the exception of melanoma, but a risk excess was even observed in patients diagnosed with NHL at age 80+ years. The present study provides accurate estimates on the adverse late effects of NHL therapy, which should guide the establishment of cancer prevention strategies in NHL survivors.
