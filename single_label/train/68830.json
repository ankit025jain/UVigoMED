{"id":68830,"title":"An autopsy case of malignant pleural mesothelioma associated with nephrotic syndrome.","abstract":"A 64-year-old man who had been exposed to asbestos was referred to our hospital for a detailed examination of left pleural effusion. A laboratory examination of the urine and blood revealed nephrotic syndrome. A thoracoscopic examination did not yield a definitive diagnosis. Twenty months later, a left pleural tumor became apparent, and the patient died of respiratory failure and cachexia. An autopsy revealed epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma. The glomeruli appeared normal under light microscopy. A review of the English literature revealed only three reports of malignant mesothelioma associated with minimal-change nephrotic syndrome. The natural course of malignant mesothelioma with nephrotic syndrome has not been previously reported.
