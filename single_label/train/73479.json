{"id":73479,"title":"The role of sphingosine kinase isoforms and receptors S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, and S1P5 in primary, secondary, and recurrent glioblastomas.","abstract":"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), the corresponding kinases SphK1-2, and receptors S1P1-3 and S1P5 are involved in cell survival and growth. Pathway components are overexpressed in many tumors including glioblastoma. Previous studies showed that the expression of SphK1 influenced survival of glioblastoma patients, yet the roles of SphK1-2 and receptors S1P1-3 and S1P5 have not been investigated in different forms of glioblastoma. Samples from 59 patients (37 males, 22 females, age 55.1?Â±?17.1 years) suffering from primary (n?=?35), recurrent (n?=?18), and secondary (n?=?6) glioblastomas were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry for expression levels of SphK1 and SphK2 and S1P1-3 and S1P5. Sixteen autopsy nontumorous brain specimens were used as controls. Expression data was correlated with clinical data and patient survival. All markers were overexpressed in the glioblastoma specimens compared to the non-neoplastic brain tissue. SphK1 and all S1P receptors were expressed in increasing order of magnitude from primary, up to recurrent and secondary glioblastomas, with values of up to 44-fold compared to normal brain tissue. In contrast, SphK2 levels were highest in primary tumors (25-fold). Expression of the sphingosine signaling pathway components was influenced by radio/radiochemotherapy in distinct ways. Immunohistochemistry for SphK1 and S1P1 confirmed the overexpression in glioblastoma. Uni- and multivariate survival analyses identified S1P5 messenger RNA levels as an independent prognostic factor of survival. The sphingosine pathway is overexpressed in glioma. Its components show distinct expression patterns in the tumor subgroups. S1P5 is identified as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis, and this pathway promises to be a candidate for targeted therapies.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903384","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.747018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.700047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.586928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.538789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.505488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.362795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.352428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0826044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Lysophospholipid receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysophospholipid_receptor"},{"name":"Order of magnitude","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude"},{"name":"Sphingosine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingosine"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Adenosine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_receptor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sea urchin","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
