{"id":46683,"title":"A rare cause of peripheral arthralgia in inflammatory bowel disease: multifocal osteonecrosis.","abstract":"Osteonecrosis (ON) is characterized by an infarction of osseous tissue in the subchondral regions of the bone. We report the case of a young male patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) developing severe and multifocal, large joint ON resulting in severe disability. Since typical symptoms of ON, like joint pain, might be misinterpreted as common extraintestinal manifestations, ON might easily be overlooked in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Plain radiographs detect only advanced cases, MRI is the diagnostic method of choice with a specificity and sensitivity of >?90?%. We discuss the incidence of ON specifically in IBD and provide an update on risk factors like treatment with corticosteroids (CS), although ON has been reported in IBD patients without previous CS treatment. Apart from that, underlying inflammation, thromboembolic events and genetic risk factors might be involved in ON development supporting the hypothesis of a complex cascade. Causative therapies for ON are not available, and surgical interventions like trepanning, core decompression and prosthetic replacement are often necessary. Our intention is to direct attention to this severe complication in the differential work-up of joint pain in IBD patients.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System
