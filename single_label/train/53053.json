{"id":53053,"title":"The role of cardiac lipotoxicity in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Cardiomyopathy, the presence of cardiac dysfunction independent of ischemic heart disease and/or hypertension, is becoming a more prominent condition in our diabetic patient population. Unfortunately, we do not yet understand the mechanism(s) responsible for causing diabetic cardiomyopathy. With the recent explosion in the obesity and Type 2 diabetes epidemic, our understanding of dyslipidemia and the adverse effects of lipid surplus on cellular and organ function has grown considerably. Numerous studies now illustrate that excess lipid accumulation may exert direct toxic effects on cellular function, a term coined 'lipotoxicity'. As obesity and Type 2 diabetes are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, cardiac lipotoxicity may represent a significant component mediating the diabetic cardiomyopathy phenotype. Therefore, a more complete understanding of how cardiac lipotoxicity is regulated and how different lipid metabolites cause cellular dysfunction may lead to the discovery of novel targets to treat cardiomyopathy in our diabetic patient population.
