{"id":17754,"title":"High prevalence of cross-resistance to aminoglycosides in fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli clinical isolates.","abstract":"Multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli, especially a lineage of O25b:H4-ST131, has increased and spread worldwide. The surveillance of cross-resistance of E. coli is necessary.Cross-resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and aminoglycosides (AGs) was examined in E. coli isolated in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, between 2008 and 2009.Gentamicin (GEN) resistance was more common in FQ-resistant isolates (30/112 strains; 26.8%) than in FQ-susceptible isolates (2/100 strains; 2%). The frequency of GEN resistance was similar in two groups of FQ-resistant strains, O25b:H4-ST131 genotype (22/87 strains; 25.3%) and a group of other FQ-resistant genotypes (8/25 strains; 32.0%). The main AG resistance gene was aac(3)-II (87.5% of GEN-resistant strains). The only amikacin-resistant strain which was FQ resistant carried the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene. CTX-M type extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL) genes were also found in FQ-resistant strains at a high frequency. However, the number of strains with both ESBL and AG-modifying enzyme genes was relatively low (8 strains).All FQ-resistant strains, not only O25b:H4-ST131, appeared to preferentially acquire ESBL genes and/or genes encoding AG-modifying enzymes; however, the acquisitions of these genes seemed to occur independently.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852043","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.795237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.729208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.602659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.591924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.584601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.508469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.383106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Aminoglycoside","weight":0.307793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Hokkaido","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido"},{"name":"Advanced Audio Coding","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"825","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/825"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Aktiengesellschaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"},{"name":"Lineage (evolution)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_(evolution)"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
