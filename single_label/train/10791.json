{"id":10791,"title":"Testing a new formulation for Peste des Petits Ruminants vaccine in Ethiopia.","abstract":"In this paper extended tests on a new candidate formulation for Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) vaccine carried out at National Veterinary Institute (NVI) in Ethiopia are presented. This work was performed in the frame of the VACNADA project from GALVmed which aimed at procuring vaccines against neglected veterinary diseases to African vaccine producing laboratories, in particular PPR. After the eradication of Rinderpest, Peste des Petits Ruminants became the next veterinary disease on target for elimination, requiring an effective and thermostable vaccine. In this work a Tris/Trehalose formulation was evaluated in thermal stability studies in comparison to the current used formulation of the live attenuated PPR vaccine, the Weybridge medium. The extended results presented herein show an increased thermal stability of the vaccine, especially at 37 and 45 Â°C, as expected from previously published results (Silva A.C. et al., 2011). Furthermore, during the course of this project, the NVI teams have clearly demonstrated ability to produce higher quality PPR vaccines after a successful transfer of the technology. These results should significantly enhance the utility of the vaccine in the eradication of PPR.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631085","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Rinderpest","weight":0.809429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ruminant","weight":0.519239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.0685896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Weybridge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weybridge"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Non-denominated postage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-denominated_postage"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Thermal stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_stability"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Thermophile","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermophile"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Veterinary pathology","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_pathology"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Procurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement"}]}
