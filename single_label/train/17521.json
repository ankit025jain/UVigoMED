{"id":17521,"title":"The significance of interleukin-6 and lactate in the synovial fluid for diagnosing native septic arthritis.","abstract":"Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of synovial interleukin-6 and synovial lactate for predicting native septic arthritis. We analyzed retrospectively synovial fluid parameters (interleukin-6, total-protein, glucose, lactate, synovial-fluid-white-blood-cell-count) of 62 patients with culture-verified native septic arthritis and compared them to 57 patients with acute aseptic arthritis. Receiver-Operating-Characteristic-curves were calculated to determine the 'Area-under-the-curves' (AUC), the best thresholds and the corresponding likelihood-ratios. The best parameter for diagnosing septic arthritis was synovial lactate (AUC = 0.864, sensitivity = 74.5%, specificity = 87.2%), followed by synovial interleukin-6 (AUC = 0.803, sensitivity = 92.5%, specificity = 64.1%) and the synovial-fluid-white-blood-cell-count (AUC = 0.782, sensitivity = 71.2%, specificity = 84.9%). Synovial lactate levels above 10 mmol/l almost proofed septic arthritis (interval-Likelihood-Ratio = 20.4), synovial interleukin-6 levels lower than 7000 pg/ml almost ruled out infection (interval-Likelihood-Ratio = 0.12). If none of these thresholds are met, physicians should estimate disease probability by the simultaneous use of the interval-Likelihood-Ratios of synovial lactate, synovial interleukin-6 and synovial-fluid-white-blood-cell-count.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873080","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.693902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.581217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.555944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Synovial fluid","weight":0.542693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.47558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.27765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.214359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"803","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/803"},{"name":"782","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/782"},{"name":"864","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/864"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"Proof test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_test"},{"name":"Native plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant"}]}
