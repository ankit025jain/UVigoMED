{"id":81676,"title":"Prevalence of bruxism in children with episodic migraine--a case-control study with polysomnography.","abstract":"Parents of children with migraine have described a higher prevalence of sleep bruxism and other sleep disturbances in their children. The objective of this study was to use polysomnography to investigate the prevalence of bruxism during sleep in children with episodic migraine relative to controls.Controls and patients were matched by sex, age, years of formal education, presence of snoring, arousals per hour, and respiratory events per hour.A total of 20 controls, between 6 and 12 years old, with no history of headache, recruited from public schools in Sao Paulo between 2009 and 2012, and 20 patients with episodic migraine recruited from the Headache Clinic at the Federal University of Sao Paulo between 2009 and 2012 underwent polysomnography.No intervention was performed before sleep studies.Among migraine patients, 27.5% experienced aura prior to migraine onset. The sleep efficiency, sleep latency, REM sleep latency, arousals per hour, percentage of sleep stages, and breathing events per hour were similar between groups. Five children (25%) with episodic migraine exhibited bruxism during the sleep study while this finding was not observed in any control (p?=?0.045).Our data demonstrate that bruxism during sleep is more prevalent in children with episodic migraine. Further prospective studies will help elucidate the underlying shared pathogenesis between bruxism and episodic migraine in children.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886343","annotations":[{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.879595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.676022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Sleep onset latency","weight":0.566864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_onset_latency"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.497222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.330056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.270076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Snoring","weight":0.234543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoring"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.127975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"University of Sao Paulo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sao_Paulo"},{"name":"Sao Paulo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sao_Paulo"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Federal government of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Episodic memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory"},{"name":"Aura (paranormal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aura_(paranormal)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"}]}
