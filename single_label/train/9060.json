{"id":9060,"title":"Intraneuronal accumulation of A?42 induces age-dependent slowing of neuronal transmission in Drosophila.","abstract":"Beta amyloid (A?42)-induced dysfunction and loss of synapses are believed to be major underlying mechanisms for the progressive loss of learning and memory abilities in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The vast majority of investigations on AD-related synaptic impairment focus on synaptic plasticity, especially the decline of long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission caused by extracellular A?42. Changes in other aspects of synaptic and neuronal functions are less studied or undiscovered. Here, we report that intraneuronal accumulation of A?42 induced an age-dependent slowing of neuronal transmission along pathways involving multiple synapses.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24733651","annotations":[{"name":"Drosophila","weight":0.863974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila"},{"name":"Beta amyloid","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_amyloid"},{"name":"Synaptic plasticity","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity"},{"name":"Neurotransmission","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmission"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.319121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.148115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"A42 road","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A42_road"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
