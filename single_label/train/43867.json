{"id":43867,"title":"Canola oil influence on azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia in Kunming mice.","abstract":"Azoxymethane (AOM) is a potent genotoxic carcinogen which specifically induces colon cancer. Hyperlipidemia and diabetes have several influences on colon cancer development, with genetic and environmental exposure aspects. Here, we investigated plasma lipid and glucose concentrations in Kunming mice randomized into four groups; control (no AOM or oil exposure), AOM control, AOM + pork oil, and AOM + canola oil. Aberrant crypt foci (ACF), plasma cholesterol, plasma triglyceride, plasma glucose and organ weight were examined 32 weeks after AOM injection. Results revealed that AOM exposure significantly increased ACF number, plasma triglyceride and glucose level. Further, male mice displayed a much higher plasma triglyceride level than female mice in the AOM control group. Dietary fat significantly inhibited AOM-induced hypertriglyceridemia, and canola oil had stronger inhibitory effect than pork oil. AOM-induced hyperglycemia had no sex-difference and was not significantly modified by dietary fat. However, AOM itself not change plasma cholesterol level. AOM significantly increased liver and spleen weight in male mice, but decreased kidney weight in female mice. On the other hand, mice testis weight decreased when fed canola oil. AOM could induce colorectal carcinogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia in Kunming mice at the same time, with subsequent studies required to investigate their genome association.
