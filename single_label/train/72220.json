{"id":72220,"title":"[Protein and mRNA expression of CTGF, CYR61, VEGF-C and VEGFR-2 in bone marrow of leukemia patients and its correlation with clinical features].","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the mRNA and protein expression of CTGF, CYR61, VEGF-C and VEGFR-2 in bone marrow of patients with leukemia, and to analyze the role and clinical significance of these 4 factors in genesis and development of leukemia, infiltration and metastasis of leukemic cells. A total of 100 cases of newly diagnosed leukemia, 26 cases of acute leukemia in complete remission and 30 controls were enrolled in this study. The mononuclear cells of bone marrow were collected, the mRNA and protein expression levels of CTGF, CYR61, VEGF-C, VEGFR-2 in leukemia patients and controls were detected by real time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of above mentioned 4 factors were significantly higher than those in control (P < 0.05), only CTGF mRNA expression in AL patients after complete remission showed statistical difference as compared with control (P < 0.05), but the expression of CTGF mRNA showed statistical significance in different bone marrow hyperplasia of acute leukemia (P < 0.05). The expression level of CTGF protein showed difference in different chromosome karyotypes of leukemia (P < 0.05). The expression levels of CYR61 and VEGF-C proteins showed statistical difference in different bone marrow hyperplasia of acute leukemia (P < 0.05). The expression level of CTGF, CYR61, VEGF-C mRNA and protein in CML group were higher than that in control group. The expression levels of CTGF and CYR61 protein were higher than that in control. The mRNA and protein expression levels of above-mentioned 4 factors in sex and infiltration lf leukemic cells did not show statistical significance(P < 0.05). In correlative analysis, the mRNA expressions of above mentioned 4 factors were positively correlated with bone marrow blast count(P < 0.05), the protein expression of CTGF, CYR61 and VEGF-C were positively correlated with bone marrow blast count. It is concluded that the CTGF, CYR61, VEGF-C and VEGFR-2 mRNA and protein play a role in acute leukemia. In acute leukemia (AML/ALL), the expression of above mentioned factor was high, but except VEGFR-2. Most of them were positively correlated with bone marrow blast count. Joint block of these angiogenesis-related factors is likely to play an important role in targeting treatment of leukemia.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989271","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.707362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.689777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.649757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.632495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.580405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.574279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.380984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.323346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.321325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.315609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.311274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.241984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.215183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Kinase insert domain receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase_insert_domain_receptor"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor C","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_C"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"}]}
