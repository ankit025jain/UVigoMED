{"id":43643,"title":"'Lnc'-ing enhancers to MYC regulation.","abstract":"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important functional components in the establishment of long-range chromosomal interactions. In a recent paper published in Cell Research, Xiang et al. provide mechanistic insight into this phenomenon by characterizing the role of CCAT1-L, a colorectal cancer-specific lncRNA, in intra-chromosome looping between the MYC gene promoter and distal upstream enhancer elements that regulate MYC transcription.
