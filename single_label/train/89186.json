{"id":89186,"title":"Intrathecal lactate as a predictor of early- but not late-onset spinal cord injury in thoracoabdominal aneurysmectomy.","abstract":"To evaluate the role of intrathecal lactate as an early predictor of spinal cord injury during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy.Observational study.University hospital.Forty-four consecutive patients scheduled to undergo thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. Two patients had a type-B dissecting aneurysm while the other 42 patients suffered from degenerative aneurysm.None.During surgery, samples of cerebrospinal fluid and arterial blood were withdrawn simultaneously to evaluate lactate concentration. Samples were collected at 4 fixed times during and after surgery: T1 (beginning of the intervention), T2 (15 minutes after aortic cross-clamping), T3 (just before unclamping), T4 (end of surgery).Mean lactate levels in cerebrospinal fluid rose consistently and steadily from the beginning of the intervention until after surgery (T1 = 1.83 mmol/L), T2 = 2.10 mmol/L, T3 = 2.72 mmol/L, T4 = 3.70 mmol/L). Seven patients developed spinal cord injury; two of them had delayed injury occurring 24 hours after the end of surgery; the remaining 5 had early onset. In this group of 5 patients, preoperative cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were significantly (p = 0.04) higher than those of the other 37 patients preoperatively (2.12 ± 0.35 v 1.79 ± 0.29 mmol/L).Preoperative cerebrospinal lactate concentration is elevated in patients who will develop early-onset spinal cord injury after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. This may allow a better stratification of these patients, suggesting a more aggressive strategy of spinal cord function preservation, such as systematic reimplanting of intercostal arteries, and possibly obtaining a better outcome.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746597","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.682648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.672465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.651311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.553591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.470113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intrathecal","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrathecal"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.364669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.319308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.291152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Intercostal arteries","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_arteries"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Aggressiveness strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggressiveness_strategy"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Intercostal muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_muscle"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Arterial blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"}]}
