{"id":82364,"title":"Plaque fluoride concentrations associated to the use of conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices.","abstract":"This double-blind, crossover study evaluated whole plaque fluoride concentration (F), as well as whole plaque calcium concentrations (Ca) after brushing with a placebo (PD - fluoride free), low-fluoride (LFD, 513 microg F/g) and conventional (CD, 1,072 microg F/g) dentifrices.Children (n=20) were randomly assigned to brush twice daily with one of the dentifrices, during 7 days. On the 7th day, samples were collected at 1 and 12 hours after brushing. F and Ca were analyzed with an ion-selective electrode and with the Arsenazo III method, respectively. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey's test and by Pearson correlation coefficient (P< 0.05).The use of the fluoridated dentifrices significantly increased plaque [F]s 1 hour after brushing when compared to PD, returning to baseline levels 12 hours after. Positive and significant correlations were found between plaque [F] and (Ca) under most of the conditions evaluated. The mean increase in plaque [F] observed 1 hour after brushing with the CD were only about 47% higher than those obtained for the LFD. The use of a LFD promotes proportionally higher increases in plaque [F] when compared to a CD. Plaque F concentrations were also shown to be dependent on plaque Ca concentrations.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640440","annotations":[{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.550287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.329769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.285637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.244105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.148553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Water fluoridation","weight":0.077158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.0604724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Karl Pearson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson"},{"name":"Brush","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Gunpowder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
