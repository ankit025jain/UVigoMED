{"id":53788,"title":"Pituitary tumors and pregnancy: the interplay between a pathologic condition and a physiologic status.","abstract":"Pregnancy is becoming a relatively common event in patients with pituitary tumors (PT), due to the increasing availability of medical treatments, which control pituitary diseases associated with the development of PT. However, the presence of PT and its treatment may be a disturbing factor for pregnancy, and pregnancy significantly influences the course and the management of PT. This review summarizes the knowledge about the management of PT during pregnancy and the occurrence of pregnancy in patients with pre-existent PT, focusing on secreting PT characterized by hormonal excess and on clinically non-functioning PT often associated to hormone deficiency, which configure the hypopituitaric syndrome.
