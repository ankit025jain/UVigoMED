{"id":84740,"title":"A prospective, randomized comparison of posterior stabilized versus cruciate-substituting total knee arthroplasty: a preliminary report with minimum 2-year results.","abstract":"We compared 56 patients who received a PS post/cam tibial insert and 55 patients who received a more congruent anterior-lipped tibial insert. We hypothesized that clinical outcomes would be equivalent and that tourniquet time and intraoperative blood loss would differ. The mean follow-up is 45 months (30-57 months). Clinical and radiographic outcomes were equivalent for both groups, except that male PS patients received significantly more transfusions than male CS patients (P<.039) and tourniquet time was significantly longer for all patients in the PS group (P<.015). At the minimum 2-year follow-up in this ongoing study, the results demonstrate equivalent functional and radiographic outcomes of the 2 devices, and significant differences in the perioperative findings of transfusion rates and tourniquet times.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25047457","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.587247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.555634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.252852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0711915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tourniquet","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourniquet"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Congruence (geometry)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry)"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
