{"id":41833,"title":"Interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and interleukin-10 in estimating the severity of acute pancreatitis: an updated meta-analysis.","abstract":"Early identification of severe AP can decrease the mortality rate and complications of SAP. The performance of IL-6 and IL-8 and IL-10 can act as markers of the severity of acute pancreatitis. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in estimating the severity of acute pancreatitis.MEDLINE and PubMed were searched from Jan 1990 to Nov 2012 for relevant studies. We calculated pooled sensitivities and specificities using the Dersimonian-Laird random-effect methods and generate the summary receiver operating curve and area under the curve was reported.Twelve studies were eligible; 9 reports including 462 patients assessed the accuracy of IL-6 on day 1 of hospital admission, 5 reports including 208 patients on day 2, and 5 reports including 188 patients on day 3. Five studies (n = 299 patients) assessed the accuracy of IL-8 on day 1, and 4 (n = 182 patients) on day 2. They are 4 studies including 284 patients of IL-10 on day 1.IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 may be the predictive markers of SAP. But the best cut-off values and the controversial results of different research may be the largest problem. Therefore, multi-center research and large samples should be done to solve the present problem.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895824","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.725164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.376707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.322886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.306626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.15119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.149266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.0527282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"SAP AG","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_AG"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"284","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/284"},{"name":"208","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/208"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Admission note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
