{"id":74102,"title":"[Feedback on service provision in cancer patients using the Ward Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ)--testing a new tool].","abstract":"Collecting information on patients' experiences and opinions is prerequisite to improving the quality of services at a ward. The Ward Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ) was developed for this purpose. We investigated its psychometric characteristics and percentage of missing values.Over a period of 4 months, all patients at an interdisciplinary and an oncology ward were asked to complete the WSQ. Concordant validity was assessed using the Patient Involvement in Care Scales (PICS).68 of 99 administered questionnaires were completed (response rate 69?%). The median of missing values per item was 6?% (0?-28?%). Internal consistency of the WSQ scales ranged from 0.68 (\"Accessibility of Doctors\") to 0.94 (\"Doctor Consultations\"). Cronbach's Alpha of the total score was 0.94. Scaling errors were 0?% (\"Ward Rounds\", \"Doctor Consulations\", \"Accessibility Nurses\") to 17?% (\"Accessibility Doctors\"). Variances of WSQ scales were relatively low. Correlation patterns of WSQ and PICS support the validity of WSQ.The WSQ facilitates systematic feedback on inpatient services. Psychometric characteristics are good and validation in a larger patient sample is warranted.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24870452","annotations":[{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.612963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.531755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Missing data","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Service (economics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics)"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"The Ward, Toronto","weight":0.015821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ward,_Toronto"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Computer security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Collecting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collecting"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Rounds (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounds_(album)"},{"name":"Platform for Internet Content Selection","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_for_Internet_Content_Selection"}]}
