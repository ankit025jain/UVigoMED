{"id":38787,"title":"Impaired bone metabolism in glycogen storage disease type 1 is associated with poor metabolic control in type 1a and with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy in type 1b.","abstract":"Glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD1) is a rare and genetically heterogeneous metabolic defect of gluconeogenesis due to mutations of either the G6PC gene (GSD1a) or the SLC37A4 gene (GSD1b). Osteopenia is a known complication of GSD1.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of poor metabolic control and/or use of GSD1-specific treatments on bone mineral density (BMD) and metabolism in GSD1 patients.In a multicenter, cross-sectional case-control study, we studied 38 GSD1 (29 GSD1a and 9 GSD1b) patients. Clinical, biochemical and instrumental parameters indicative of bone metabolism were analyzed; BMD was evaluated by dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry and quantitative ultrasound.Both GSD1a and GSD1b patients showed reduced BMD compared with age-matched controls. In GSD1a patients, these abnormalities correlated with compliance to diet and biochemical indicators of metabolic control. In GSD1b patients, BMD correlated with the age at first administration and the duration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy.Our data indicate that good metabolic control and compliance with diet are highly recommended to improve bone metabolism in GSD1a patients. GSD1b patients on G-CSF treatment should be carefully monitored for the risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401800","annotations":[{"name":"Glycogen storage disease","weight":0.831555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_storage_disease"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Glycogen","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gluconeogenesis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Osteopenia","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopenia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.663328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.626775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.577528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Instrumental","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Holotype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype"},{"name":"Conservative Government 1852","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Government_1852"},{"name":"Glycogen storage disease type I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_storage_disease_type_I"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"G8","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data storage device","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage_device"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
