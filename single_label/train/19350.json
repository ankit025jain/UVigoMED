{"id":19350,"title":"Trend in decline in leprosy disabilities of a LEPRA project in Malkangiri district, Odisha, India.","abstract":"This a retrospective analysis of the changes in 646 disabilities occurred amongst 3979 cases registered during 19 years from 1992 to 2010 in Malkangiri district. This amounted to 16.2% of cases with disability segregated to 310 (48%) Grade 1 and 336 (52%) Grade 2. In this project, managed by LEPRA India, POD care was in practice from the year 1992 and records were updated regularly. An analysis of the annual records showed that the next year-end balance increased up to the year 2001 followed by gradual decline. Within this period the total cases with disabilities declined by about 369 (57%) due to death by aging 204 (55%), migration from the area 77 (21%) and reversing to normal 88 (24%) in cases. Deletion due to recovery to normal especially with sensory impairment is fairly good with or without steroid. Disability percentage in new cases declined steadily especially Grade 2 from 30% to 1%, initial high rate attributed mostly to backlog cases. In later years the rate is erratic high amongst low number of new cases. Absolute number indicates the situation better. Such study helps to roughly extrapolate the existing disability load in a particular area and assists in planning for care and prevention.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724231","annotations":[{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"India","weight":0.4316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Orissa","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orissa"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.331231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"LEPRA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEPRA"},{"name":"Malkangiri","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malkangiri"},{"name":"Malkangiri district","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malkangiri_district"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"1992","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992"},{"name":"646","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/646"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Sensory deprivation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_deprivation"},{"name":"Extrapolation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"3979 Brorsen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3979_Brorsen"}]}
