{"id":63081,"title":"Congestion bleeding of the head and neck following myocardial infarction.","abstract":"We present an unusual case of congestion bleeding of the head and neck following myocardial infarction. A 51-year-old man presented with widespread facial petechiae and subconjunctival haemorrhages following a collapse associated with evolving electrocardiographic changes. Emergency coronary artery stent placement was undertaken. No cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed. We hypothesise that the presence of facial petechiae in our case following transient loss of consciousness due to a presumed ventricular arrhythmia in the setting of acute myocardial ischaemia, may have been precipitated by a Valsalva manoeuvre on regaining consciousness with sudden acute increase in venous pressure and consequent venous congestion of the head and neck, and that congestion bleeding of the face may occur in acute cardiac events without a history of CPR.
