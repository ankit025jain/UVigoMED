{"id":88350,"title":"Interventricular septal rupture after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: surgical and perioperative management.","abstract":"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with various complications, usually related to valve positioning or prosthesis delivery. We report the rare complication of an iatrogenic ventricular septal defect, secondary to aortic annulus disruption after TAVI-transfemoral procedure, generating a significant left-to-right shunt and cardiac failure. Open surgical procedures under cardiopulmonary bypass remain the best option for this lethal complication.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861676","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.534228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.492913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.326841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Cardiac skeleton","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_skeleton"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
