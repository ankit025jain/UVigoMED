{"id":36302,"title":"Large intrathoracic meningocele in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1.","abstract":"Intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 is quite rare. We report the case of a Chinese women with a 20-day history of right-sided chest pain and sense of pressure on the chest.
