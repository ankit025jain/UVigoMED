{"id":50907,"title":"Vintafolide (EC145) for the treatment of folate-receptor-? positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Seminal advances in the treatment of cancer have been achieved because of drug development in ovarian cancer; notably the developments of platinums and taxanes. However, no new drug has been FDA approved for ovarian cancer since 2006, and the approval of an antiangiogenic agent for ovarian cancer in the US has stalled. Predicting the next breakthrough is a high risk and highly expensive venture. One of the most promising prospects is folate-receptor (FR)-targeted therapy, given the high expression in FR ovarian cancer. We review the development of vintafolide (EC145), a folic acid-desacetylvinblastine conjugate, the predictive utility of a FR-targeted imaging agent, technetium-(99)m-etarfolatide (EC20), the challenges in proving survival advantage, and other approaches to exploiting FR as a target in ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742319","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.636415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.512388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.492058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.454902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.380041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.355612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.29772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Taxane","weight":0.273369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.0637772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Survival of the fittest","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest"},{"name":"Eurocopter EC 145","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocopter_EC_145"},{"name":"Imaging agent","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_agent"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"European Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Stall (flight)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(flight)"},{"name":"Sports agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_agent"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
