{"id":62187,"title":"?- and ?-papillomavirus infection in a young patient with an unclassified primary T-cell immunodeficiency and multiple mucosal and cutaneous lesions.","abstract":"Correlating human papillomavirus (HPV) type with the clinical and histopathological features of skin lesions (from genital and nongenital sites) can present a diagnostic challenge.In this study, HPV infection patterns were correlated with pathology and clinical presentation in lesional and nonlesional body sites from a young patient with a primary T-cell immunodeficiency.HPV infection was evaluated at both DNA and protein levels by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.The patient's genital lesions were caused exclusively by ?-genotypes (high-risk type HPV-51 in the anal and low-risk type HPV-72 in the penile condylomas). The opposite was true for the skin lesions, which were infected by ?-genotypes alone (HPV-8 and HPV-24). HPV-24 was the predominant type in terms of viral load, and the only one found in productive areas of infection. The patient had already developed high-grade dysplasia in the anal condyloma-like lesions, and showed areas of early-stage dysplasia in the lesions caused by the ?-genotype HPV-24.The basic origin of the immunodeficiency is not yet defined.These findings provide proof of principle that both ?- and ?-genotypes can cause overt dysplastic lesions when immunosurveillance is lost, which is not restricted to epidermodysplasia verruciformis.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612648","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Epidermodysplasia verruciformis","weight":0.761605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermodysplasia_verruciformis"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.492493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.463746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.259797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.252612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.223263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.139894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Proof of concept","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer immunotherapy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
