{"id":23585,"title":"A simplified sequence-based identification scheme for Bordetella reveals several putative novel species.","abstract":"The differentiation of Bordetella species, particularly those causing human infection, is problematic. We found that sequence analysis of an internal fragment of nrdA allowed differentiation of the currently named Bordetella species. Analysis of 107 \"Bordetella\" isolates recovered almost exclusively from human respiratory tract specimens identified several putative novel species.
