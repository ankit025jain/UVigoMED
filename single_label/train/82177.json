{"id":82177,"title":"Buccal mucosa tumour around the parotid papilla.","abstract":"We present a case of a 50-year-old male patient with a lump around the right parotid papilla. A 25Ã—20 mm soft pendulous lump was identified around the right parotid duct. After obtaining non-malignant results from a tissue biopsy, we resected the tumour to preserve the right parotid duct under local anaesthesia. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and maintained normal salivary secretion function. Based on the histopathological features, the lump was thought to have developed secondary to being repeatedly bitten. Several cases of parotid duct disease have been reported, but a literature search revealed that the present case is rare.
