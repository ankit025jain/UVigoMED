{"id":15093,"title":"[O3:K6 serogroup vibrio parahaemolyticus - the causative agent of food toxic infection outbreaks in Primorsky region of Russian federation].","abstract":"Comparative evaluation of biological properties of parahemolytic vibrios that had determined outbreaks and sporadic cases of food toxic infection in Primorsky Region in 2012 and previous years. Materials AND METHODS: 40 clinical strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated in 2012 were studied in comparison with 62 strains from this region that had been characterized by us previously. Virulence was evaluated by a complex method: hemolytic activitywas determined in Kanagawa test (KT), urease - in Kristensen medium. Serotyping was carried out by a commercial kit of O/K sera. PCR-genotyping was carried out by marker genes of 7 pathogenicity \"islands\" (VPaI-1-7).All the strains isolated from patients in 2012 had KT-positive and urease-negative phenotype, belonged to O3:K6 serogroup and contained marker genes of 7 VPal that allowed to consider them members of a \"pandemic\" clone as the other clinical strains from this region. However among 2012 strains an increase of number of antibiotic-resistant variants was established compared with 1997 isolates.The data obtained give evidence on the risk of spread of a \"pandemic\" clone of V. parahaemolyticus in the Far-Eastern region of Russia, a dangerous tendency of antibiotic-resistant variant formation and a necessity to monitor morbidity and the environment with mandatory PCR-detection of genes associated with virulence including integrated into pathogenicity \"islands\".","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286530","annotations":[{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.623892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.616912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.572261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.538274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.476917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.464248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.441017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.416672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.40787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.326696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.262776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Primorsky Krai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorsky_Krai"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Oklahoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"Russians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material"}]}
