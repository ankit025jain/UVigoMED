{"id":26305,"title":"Implant-based multiparameter telemonitoring of patients with heart failure (IN-TIME): a randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"An increasing number of patients with heart failure receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) or cardiac resynchronisation defibrillators (CRT-Ds) with telemonitoring function. Early detection of worsening heart failure, or upstream factors predisposing to worsening heart failure, by implant-based telemonitoring might enable pre-emptive intervention and improve outcomes, but the evidence is weak. We investigated this possibility in IN-TIME, a clinical trial.We enrolled 716 patients, of whom 664 were randomly assigned (333 to telemonitoring, 331 to control). Mean age was 65·5 years and mean ejection fraction was 26%. 285 (43%) of patients had NYHA functional class II and 378 (57%) had NYHA class III. Most patients received CRT-Ds (390; 58·7%). At 1 year, 63 (18·9%) of 333 patients in the telemonitoring group versus 90 (27·2%) of 331 in the control group (p=0·013) had worsened composite score (odds ratio 0·63, 95% CI 0·43-0·90). Ten versus 27 patients died during follow-up.Automatic, daily, implant-based, multiparameter telemonitoring can significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure. Such telemonitoring is feasible and should be used in clinical practice.Biotronik SE & Co.
