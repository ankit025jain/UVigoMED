{"id":37900,"title":"Nitric oxide therapy for post-laparoscopic surgery associated patent foramen ovale: incidence, mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy.","abstract":"Postoperative hypoxemia is a common clinical challenge. The diagnosis of an underlying cause of hypoxemia may not immediately be apparent. Clinically silent and non-functional intracardiac shunt may become apparent and pose significant management problems in the postoperative period.We describe a case where clinically significant hypoxemia resulted from a patent foramen ovale (PFO) after laparoscopic surgery due to changes in the intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures.This condition was effectively diagnosed by bedside echocardiography, and was effectively treated with nitric oxide.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462121","annotations":[{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.781457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.737452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.71617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.634672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.588649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.567121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Foramen ovale (heart)","weight":0.284061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen_ovale_(heart)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.276722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"}]}
