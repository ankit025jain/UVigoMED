{"id":53676,"title":"Evaluation of the relationship between weight change and glycemic control after initiation of antidiabetic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes using electronic medical record data.","abstract":"This study evaluates the relationship between HbA1c and weight change outcomes by anti-diabetic weight-effect properties in patients newly treated for type 2 diabetes; a relationship not previously characterized.Electronic medical records of patients with type 2 diabetes newly prescribed anti-diabetic monotherapy were assessed to identify HbA1c goal attainment [(<53 mmol/mol)] and weight change at 1-year. Anti-diabetics were categorized by weight-effect properties: weight-gain (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones) and weight-loss/neutral (metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists). Logistic regression analyses identified likelihood of attaining HbA1c goal or ?3% weight loss by anti-diabetic category controlling for baseline characteristics. MANOVA was used to identify correlation between changes in weight and HbA1c.The study included 28,290 patients. Mean age ± sd was 61 years ±11.8. Baseline HbA1c was 7.4% ± 1.6 (57 mmol/mol ± 17); 67.3% were prescribed a weight-loss/neutral anti-diabetic. At 1-year, more patients in the weight-loss/neutral anti-diabetic category lost weight (?3%) than in the weight-gain anti-diabetic category (40.4% vs. 24.2%, p<0.001) or had an HbA1c<7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) (71.1% vs. 63.8%, p<0.001). Those prescribed a weight-gain anti-diabetic were 53% less likely to lose weight and 29% less likely to be at HbA1c goal than those prescribed a weight-loss/neutral anti-diabetic (p<0.001). Weight loss and HbA1c outcomes were significantly correlated (p<0.001).Weight loss of ?3% was associated with better glycemic control in patients newly treated for type 2 diabetes. Anti-diabetics associated with weight-loss/neutrality were associated with greater weight loss and HbA1c goal attainment and may facilitate efforts to co-manage weight and glycemia in the ambulatory-care setting.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503045","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.744551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.61431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.550865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.414053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor","weight":0.381686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitor"},{"name":"Thiazolidinedione","weight":0.284004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazolidinedione"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.151538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sulfonylurea","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Electronic medical record","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Democratic Progressive Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"C (musical note)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(musical_note)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"FAA airport categories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAA_airport_categories"},{"name":"Weight transfer (dance move)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_transfer_(dance_move)"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Goal programming","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_programming"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
