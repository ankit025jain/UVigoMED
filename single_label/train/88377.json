{"id":88377,"title":"Arthroscopic stabilization for recurrent shoulder instability with moderate glenoid bone defect in patients with moderate to low functional demand.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional outcomes of arthroscopic Bankart repair for recurrent shoulder instability in the setting of moderate glenoid bone defect ranging from 20% to 30% in patients with moderate to low functional demand.This study included 36 patients with unilateral recurrent instability and glenoid bone defects of 20% to 30% treated with arthroscopic stabilization. Glenoid bone loss was estimated on the en-face view of preoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography. Joint laxity was assessed clinically by use of the Beighton and Horan criteria, and patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of excessive joint laxity, group L (n = 13), or absence of excessive joint laxity, group N (n = 23). Functional assessments were performed with the patient-reported activity level; subjective shoulder value; Rowe score; and University of California, Los Angeles shoulder score.The mean glenoid defect size was 25.1% (range, 20% to 29%), and the overall functional outcomes improved significantly after surgery. A return to greater than 90% of the premorbid activity level was reported by 72% of patients (26 of 36 patients), and patient satisfaction was 83% (30 of 36 patients). There was no significant difference in functional outcomes between groups L and N (subjective shoulder value, 85.0% for group L v 88.9% for group N, P = .397; Rowe score, 83.5 for group L v 92.8 for group N, P = .537; and University of California, Los Angeles shoulder score, 32.2 for group L v 31.9 for group N, P = .697). Recurrent instability occurred in 4 patients (11%), 3 patients in group L (3 of 13, 23%) and 1 patient in group N (1 of 23, 4%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = .125).Arthroscopic stabilization for recurrent shoulder instability in patients with moderate to low functional demand produced satisfactory outcomes despite the presence of moderate glenoid bone defects of 20% to 30%. For patients with excessive joint laxity, however, arthroscopic stabilization may not be reliable, with a recurrence rate of 23%.Level IV, therapeutic case series.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857422","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.719088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.541668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.529701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.458106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"University of California, Los Angeles","weight":0.443581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"California","weight":0.277528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.255984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0665281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Beighton","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beighton"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.0290314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Glenoid cavity","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"397","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/397"},{"name":"537","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/537"},{"name":"697","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/697"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"Group N","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_N"},{"name":"Horan","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horan"},{"name":"Dhaka-Chittagong Highway","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka-Chittagong_Highway"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Supply and demand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand"},{"name":"Rowe, Massachusetts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowe,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Dislocated shoulder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder"}]}
