{"id":69186,"title":"Role of microRNA-27a in down-regulation of angiogenic factor AGGF1 under hypoxia associated with high-grade bladder urothelial carcinoma.","abstract":"Hypoxia stimulates angiogenesis under a variety of pathological conditions, including malignant tumors by inducing expression of angiogenic factors such as VEGFA. Surprisingly, here we report significant association between down-regulation of a new angiogenic factor AGGF1 and high-grade urothelial carcinoma. The proportion of strong AGGF1 expression cases was significantly lower in the high-grade urothelial carcinoma group than that in the low-grade urothelial carcinoma group (P=1.40×10(-5)) or than that in the normal urothelium tissue group (P=2.11×10(-4)). We hypothesized that tumor hypoxia was responsible for differential expression of the AGGF1 protein in low- and high-grade urothelial carcinomas, and therefore investigated the molecular regulatory mechanism for AGGF1 expression under hypoxia. Under hypoxic conditions, AGGF1 protein levels declined without any change in mRNA levels and protein stability. Hypoxia-induced down-regulation of AGGF1 was mediated by miR-27a. Overexpression of miR-27a suppressed AGGF1 expression through translational inhibition, but not by RNA degradation. Moreover, the hypoxia-induced decrease of AGGF1 expression disappeared after miR-27a expression was inhibited. Furthermore, down-regulation of AGGF1 reduced hypoxia-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that (1) hypoxia down-regulates expression of the AGGF1 protein, but not AGGF1 mRNA, by inducing expression of miR-27a; (2) Down-regulation of AGGF1 had an apparent protective role for cancer cells under hypoxia; (3) Down-regulation of the AGGF1 protein confers a significant risk of high-grade human urothelial bladder carcinoma.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462738","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.628037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.548063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.510356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.408977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.168048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Hypoxia (environmental)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Tumor hypoxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_hypoxia"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"List of grape varieties","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_varieties"},{"name":"Adenosine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_receptor"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"}]}
