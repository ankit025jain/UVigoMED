{"id":43417,"title":"Prognostic significance of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in primary liver cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a useful biomarker that reflects systemic inflammation responses. However, the prognostic value of the NLR in patients with primary liver cancer (PLC) remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of 26 studies (comprising 4,461 patients) to evaluate the association between the pre-treatment NLR and clinical outcomes of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with PLC. The correlation between NLR and tumor characteristics or other inflammation-related parameters was also assessed. Data were synthesized using the random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird, and the hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate effect size. Our analysis indicated that a high NLR predicted poor OS (HR, 2.102; 95% CI: 1.741-2.538) and DFS (HR, 2.474; 95% CI: 1.855-3.300) for PLC. A high NLR was associated with the presence of tumor vascular invasion (OR: 1.889, 95% CI: 1.487-2.400; p<0.001) and an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level (OR: 1.536; 95% CI: 1.152-2.048; p = 0.003). Thus, we conclude that a high NLR indicates a poor prognosis for patients with PLC and may also be predictive for PLC invasion and metastasis. Subgroup analysis suggested that the predictive role of NLR in cholangiocarcinoma is limited, and a further large study to confirm these findings is warranted.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788770","annotations":[{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.917494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.86591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.817506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.663236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.445397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.386599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.336452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.199594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1522","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1522"},{"name":"536","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/536"},{"name":"538","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/538"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"889","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/889"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"North London Railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_Railway"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Laird","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
