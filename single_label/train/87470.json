{"id":87470,"title":"The role of angiography and embolization in blunt splenic trauma.","abstract":"The spleen is one of the most vulnerable organs in the event of an abdominal trauma. Preservation of the spleen and of course its functions has been a continuing challenge familiar not only for trauma surgeons but also for all those for whom the integrity of this organ was a well-founded goal. Therefore nonoperative management (NOM) of spleen trauma injury has faced a continuous development, gradually becoming an option of healing by first intention among Trauma Centers. Through the development of modern technology it has become possible to keep observation documents on the evolution of blunt splenic injuries and, also, minimally invasive therapeutic approach has become possible. Out of these approaches angiography and consecutive embolization are gaining more and more ground considering the increasing experience and the convincing results that have been constantly reported in the last few years.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149603","annotations":[{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.598141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.535711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.478737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.323435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.118306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.0540607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Well-founded relation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Keep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"White pulp","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_pulp"}]}
