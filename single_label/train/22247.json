{"id":22247,"title":"Proteomic analysis of differential protein expression in platelets of septic patients.","abstract":"Sepsis is one of the major health problems all over the world. Early diagnostic of sepsis is an attractive strategy to decrease the mortality of septic patients. However, an effective biomarker that fulfills all the necessary requirements for the accurate characterization of sepsis is still unavailable until now. In this study, the 2-DE technique followed by mass spectrometry and a database search was used for searching and identifying the differential expressed proteins in platelets between septic patients and paired healthy controls. Platelet 2-DE profiles of septic patients and paired healthy controls with high resolution and reproducibility were obtained. Differential platelet 2-DE profiles between septic patients and paired healthy controls were established. Differential protein spots between normal healthy volunteers and septic patients from platelet 2-DE profiles were identified by 2-DE followed with mass spectrometry and a database search. Five proteins with increased expression were identified between septic patients and healthy controls from platelet samples. These up-expressed proteins were EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing protein 7, actin, interleukin-1?, glycoprotein IX, and glycoprotein IIB. Sepsis induces a complex regulation of platelet protein changes. Our study highlights the important role of these differential expressed proteins in sepsis, which deserve further research as potential candidates for therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, our research is beneficial for the future developments of sepsis diagnosis and therapy.
