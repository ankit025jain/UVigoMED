{"id":62223,"title":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 deficiency ameliorates insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia but not bone loss in obese female mice.","abstract":"We previously demonstrated that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is involved in type 1 diabetic bone loss in female mice. PAI-1 is well known as an adipogenic factor induced by obesity. We therefore examined the effects of PAI-1 deficiency on bone and glucose and lipid metabolism in high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HF/HSD)-induced obese female mice. Female wild-type (WT) and PAI-1-deficient mice were fed with HF/HSD or normal diet for 20 weeks from 10 weeks of age. HF/HSD increased the levels of plasma PAI-1 in WT mice. PAI-1 deficiency suppressed the levels of blood glucose, plasma insulin, and total cholesterol elevated by obesity. Moreover, PAI-1 deficiency improved glucose intolerance and insulin resistance induced by obesity. Bone mineral density (BMD) at trabecular bone as well as the levels of osterix, alkaline phosphatase, and receptor activator of nuclear factor ?B ligand mRNA in tibia were decreased by HF/HSD in WT mice, and those changes by HF/HSD were not affected by PAI-1 deficiency. HF/HSD increased the levels of plasma TNF-? in both WT and PAI-1-deficient mice, and the levels of plasma TNF-? were negatively correlated with trabecular BMD in tibia of female mice. In conclusion, we revealed that PAI-1 deficiency does not affect the trabecular bone loss induced by obesity despite the amelioration of insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia in female mice. Our data suggest that the changes of BMD and bone metabolism by obesity might be independent of PAI-1 as well as glucose and lipid metabolism.
