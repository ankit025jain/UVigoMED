{"id":57661,"title":"[The diet in improving fertility in women].","abstract":"Fertility disorders and the resulting inability to reproduce constitute an increasingly common public health problem in contemporary society. The growing scale of this phenomenon has prompted the World Health Organization to recognize infertility as a social disease, which affects about 13-17% of couples of reproductive age. Recent studies have shown that lifestyle, and especially diet, can influence reproductive health and proper nutrition and nutritional status can decrease the risk of fertility disorders. A larger intake of monounsaturated fatty acids; of fruit and vegetable products that are a good source of protein and nonheme iron; and of high-fat dairy is recommended in order to improve women's fertility. The intake of trans fatty acids and carbohydrate products with a high glycaemic index should be reduced. Supplementing the diet with multivitamin products containing folic acid and iron is also advised. Complementing fertility therapy with modifying the diet and planning proper nutrition may result in increasing the effectiveness of the treatment.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095641","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Trans fat","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Multivitamin","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivitamin"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.722947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Monounsaturated fat","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monounsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.53907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.474772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Reproductive health","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_health"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Cis-trans isomerism","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis-trans_isomerism"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Modernity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
