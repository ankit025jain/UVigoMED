{"id":15027,"title":"Extensive rostral mandibulectomy for treatment of ameloblastoma in a horse.","abstract":"To report long-term outcome in a mare that had extensive rostral mandibulectomy to remove an ameloblastoma.Clinical report.A 21-year-old mare.An ameloblastoma, located in the rostral aspect of the mandible, was removed by complete en-bloc resection of the tumor, removing most of the mandibular symphysis.The day after surgery, the remaining mandibular symphysis (<5?mm) fractured causing marked instability of the hemi-mandibles. Partial wound dehiscence occurred 5 days after surgery; however, the mare was able to eat well and the incision healed within 2 weeks. At 18 months, there was bony fusion of the hemi-mandibles and mild protrusion of the tongue.Extensive rostral mandibulectomy (up to the caudal edge of the mandibular symphysis) can apparently be performed in a horse without internal or external stabilization, and yield a cosmetic and functional outcome.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392727","annotations":[{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.866901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.622162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symphysis menti","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphysis_menti"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symphysis","weight":0.241228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphysis"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Ameloblastoma","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameloblastoma"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Mare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Saab 21","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_21"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"}]}
