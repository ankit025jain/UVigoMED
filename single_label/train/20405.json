{"id":20405,"title":"[Clinical effect of triple therapy combined with Saccharomyces boulardii in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in children].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical effect of proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy combined with Saccharomyces boulardii in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection among children in terms of Hp eradication rate and incidence of adverse events.A prospective randomised controlled study was conducted on 240 children with a confirmed diagnosis of Hp infection. These patients were randomized into triple therapy (n=120) and probiotics groups (n=120). The triple therapy group received amoxicillin [40?mg/(kg·d), Tid], clarithromycin [15?mg/(kg·d), Bid] and omeprazole [0.7-0.8?mg/(kg·d), Qd], while the probiotics group received Saccharomyces boulardii (250?mg, Bid) in addition to triple therapy. The course of treatment was 14 days in both groups. The adverse events in subjects were recorded by their parents during treatment. Hp eradiation was evaluated by (13)C breath test at 4 weeks after treatment, and the eradication rate and incidence of adverse events were compared between the two groups.The Hp eradication rates were 75.8% (91/120) in the triple therapy group and 85% (102/120) in the probiotics group (P>0.05). Compared with the triple therapy group, the probiotics group had nonsignificantly lower incidence of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (P>0.05) and significantly lower incidence of stomatitis, constipation and diarrhea (P<0.05).Triple therapy combined with Saccharomyces boulardii cannot significantly increase Hp eradication rate, but can significantly reduce the incidence of stomatitis, constipation, and diarrhea during treatment.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661511","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Omeprazole","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Clarithromycin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarithromycin"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.785405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.666485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stomatitis","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomatitis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Saccharomyces boulardii","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_boulardii"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Carbon-13","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-13"},{"name":"Support group","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Breath test","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_test"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
