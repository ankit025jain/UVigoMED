{"id":43986,"title":"The PTEN/PI3K/Akt and Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathways are involved in the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on human colon cancer cell proliferation.","abstract":"Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the treatments for colon cancer have been developed substantially in the last decades, but there is still a great clinical need to explore new treatment regimens due to the undesirable prognosis. In this investigation, we demonstrated the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities of resveratrol (Res) in human colon cancer cells, and the possible mechanisms underlying these effects. We used crystal violet staining, flow cytometry and western blotting to validate the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of Res on HCT116 cells. A xenograft tumor model was used to confirm the anti-proliferative effects of Res. We employed polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, recombinant adenovirus and luciferase reporter assay to explore the possible mechanism(s) of action. We found that Res inhibits significantly the proliferation and promotes apoptosis in HCT116 cells, as well as inhibits the xenograft tumor growth of colon cancer. Res upregulates the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and decreases the phosphorylation of Akt1/2. The exogenous expression of PTEN inhibits the PI3K/Akt signal and promotes the anti-proliferative effects of Res in HCT116 cells, while knockdown of PTEN increases PI3K/Akt signal but reduces the anti-proliferative function of Res. The protein and mRNA expression of ?-catenin are all decreased by Res concentration-dependently. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of Res in human colon cancer cells may be mediated by regulating separately the PTEN/PI3K/Akt and Wnt/?-catenin signaling.
