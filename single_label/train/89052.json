{"id":89052,"title":"The horizontal Y-shaped graft with respective graft tension angles in anatomical two-bundle medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction.","abstract":"Various techniques for medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction have been described with two bundles of graft tensioned simultaneously. The present study was to introduce an anatomical reconstruction procedure using a horizontal Y-shaped graft with respective graft tension angles and report the preliminary results.A surgical technique for MPFL reconstruction using a horizontal Y-shaped semitendinosus tendon autograft with two bundles tensioned at 0° and 30° of knee flexion was described in detail. The patellar stability was evaluated with the apprehension test and an axial computed tomography (CT) scan at 30° of knee flexion. The knee function was evaluated using the Lysholm and Kujala scores.No recurrent dislocation or subluxation was reported for 45 patients at a mean of 33.7-month follow-up. On CT images, congruence angle, patellar tilt angle, lateral patellar angle and lateral displacement were restored to the normal range. At the last follow-up, the mean Lysholm score improved from 51.8±6.2 to 91.7±4.1 and mean Kujala score was from 53.4±5.3 to 90.9±6.6 (P<0.01).The present anatomical MPFL reconstruction technique with a horizontal Y-shaped two-bundle graft tensioned at respective knee flexion angles could not only recreate the fan-shape of MPFL but also mimic the function bundles of native ligament. Clinical follow-up confirms the good restoration of the patellar stability and significant improvement of knee function without special complications.Therapeutic, Level IV.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760161","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.739524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.69329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.643381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.550058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.530041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.474091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.454937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.18063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Semitendinosus muscle","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitendinosus_muscle"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
