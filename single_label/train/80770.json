{"id":80770,"title":"Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography appearance of a retinal nematode.","abstract":"A 65-year-old man presented with decreased visual acuity in his left eye of 10 days' duration. Ocular examination revealed visual acuity of 20/200 in the left eye caused by a visible retinal nematode (roundworm) located close to the fovea. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging showed the nematode in the retinal nerve fiber layer. The patient was followed up without treatment, and the nematode disappeared spontaneously after 5 weeks. Visual acuity in the affected eye improved to 20/25.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548761","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.873017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.663904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.641531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.506417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nerve fiber layer","weight":0.440396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber_layer"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.267613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"2025","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"}]}
