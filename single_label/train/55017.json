{"id":55017,"title":"Effect of anti-VEGF treatment on choroidal thickness over time in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"To evaluate change in subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) as measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD) undergoing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.Patients with a diagnosis of NVAMD were retrospectively reviewed to identify those who had at least 12 months of follow-up. The SCT was manually measured from Bruch membrane to the choroid-sclera junction at baseline and last follow-up. Only cases in which the choroid was fully visible were included in quantitative analyses. The SCT measurements were correlated with other characteristics including number and duration of treatments.Sixty eyes of 47 patients with a follow-up of 23.8 months (SD 7.3) met study inclusion criteria, and 49 eyes of 40 patients received anti-VEGF treatment. Mean age was 83.7 years, and 52% were female. Treated eyes received a mean of 7.8 (SD 7.3) intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. The SCT at baseline was 126.7 ?m (SD 50.6) for untreated and 136.2 ?m (SD 57.6) for treated eyes. The SCT showed a decrease over time in both groups, with a mean rate of reduction of 6.0 ?m (p&lt;0.0002) in treated eyes and 3.6 ?m (p = 0.3741) in untreated eyes. However, the change in SCT did not differ between the groups (p = 0.5113), and did not correlate with the number of re-treatments (p = 0.552), visual acuity at baseline (p = 0.618), or change in visual acuity over time (p = 0.429).Although choroidal thickness decreased over time in eyes with NVAMD, anti-VEGF therapy did not appear to accelerate or otherwise alter this decline.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25044137","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.862755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.66495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.661334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.413084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.393744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.330875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.302517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.258524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.220329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Bruch's membrane","weight":0.211412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruch's_membrane"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.126925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.124455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"South Dakota Highway 50","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_Highway_50"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"618","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/618"},{"name":"Max Bruch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Bruch"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Malagasy language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malagasy_language"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"California's 7th State Senate district","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_7th_State_Senate_district"}]}
