{"id":36933,"title":"Ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins in a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla).","abstract":"Conjoined twinning is rare in man and non-human primates. The current report describes a case of ischiopagus tripus conjoined Western Lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) twins. The female twins were joined at the umbilical and pelvic region, involving the liver, xiphoid, umbilicus, body wall and skin. Computed tomography revealed two complete spines. The combined pelvic space was formed by two sacra, each connected with two iliac bones. The twins were only conjoined by a common pubis. Cause of death was attributed to cardiac and circulatory collapse resulting from a large patent foramen ovale (8 mm in diameter) of one twin and neonatal asphyxia.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529511","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.736605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Body","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Navel","weight":0.673778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.603184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Conjoined twins","weight":0.578961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins"},{"name":"Pubis (bone)","weight":0.522162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.458261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Gorilla","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.358029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.334413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.250679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.178473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Fish anatomy","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_anatomy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Perinatal asphyxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_asphyxia"},{"name":"Western lowland gorilla","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla"},{"name":"Ischiopagi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischiopagi"},{"name":"Xiphoid process","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiphoid_process"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Foramen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen"}]}
