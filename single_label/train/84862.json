{"id":84862,"title":"Piezosurgery applied to implant dentistry: clinical and biological aspects.","abstract":"Piezosurgery is a new and modern technique of bone surgery in implantology. Selective cutting is possible for different ultrasonic frequencies acting only in hard tissues (mineralized), saving vital anatomical structures. With the piezoelectric osteotomy technique, receptor site preparation for implants, autogenous bone graft acquistition (particles and blocks), osteotomy for alveolar bone crest expansion, maxillary sinus lifting, and dental implant removal can be performed accurately and safely, providing excellent clinical and biological results, especially for osteocyte viability. The aim of this review was, through literature review, to present clinical applications of piezosurgery in implant dentistry and outline their advantages and disadvantages over conventional surgical systems. Moreover, this study addressed the biological aspects related to piezosurgery that differentiate it from those of bone tissue approaches. Overall, piezosurgery enables critical operations in simple and fully executable procedures; and effectively, areas that are difficult to access have less risk of soft tissue and neurovascular tissue damage via piezosurgery.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25020222","annotations":[{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.788896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.538962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.513981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.457443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.2922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.249696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Piezosurgery","weight":0.208333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezosurgery"},{"name":"Piezoelectricity","weight":0.190579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Osteocyte","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteocyte"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Biomineralization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomineralization"}]}
