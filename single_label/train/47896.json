{"id":47896,"title":"MACC1 expression correlates with PFKFB2 and survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"To validate the relationship between MACC1 and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2, 6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB2) expression as well as its clinicopathological features and prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma.By using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the MACC1 and PFKFB2 protein expression in 60 pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma and corresponding non-tumor tissues. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and Spearman analysis, we studied the relationship between MACC1 and PFKFB2 protein expression and postoperative overall survival (OS) of the HCC patients.MACC1 and PFKFB2 positive staining rates were significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinoma than in the corresponding nontumor tissues (P=0.012 and 0.04, respectively). The clinicopathological features evaluation revealed that positive expression of MACC1 was associated with a high Edmondson classification (P=0.007) and advanced TNM stage (P=0.027). Similar findings were evident for PFKFB2 expression (P=0.002 and P=0.027). MACC1 and PFKFB2 positive expression was associated with a lower OS rate (P=0.004 and 0.03, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses revealed MACC1 positive expression to be a prognostic factor for postoperative OS, but PFKFB was not.Highly expressed MACC1 and PFKFB2 protein were associated with TNM stage, Edmondson -Steier classification and overall survival. MACC1 may affect tumor metabolism partly through expression and phophorylation of PFKFB2.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568531","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.850641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.605737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.580374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.564358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.54967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.513761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.370755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.288198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.208685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Spearman's rank correlation coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Master of Accountancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Accountancy"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
