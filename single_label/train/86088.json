{"id":86088,"title":"Role of household exposure, dietary habits and glutathione S-Transferases M1, T1 polymorphisms in susceptibility to lung cancer among women in Mizoram India.","abstract":"A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the effect of household exposure, dietary habits, smoking and Glutathione S-Transferases M1, T1 polymorphisms on lung cancer among women in Mizoram, India.We selected 230 newly diagnosed primary lung cases and 460 controls from women in Mizoram. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate adjusted odds ratio (OR).Exposure of cooking oil fumes (p<0.003), wood as heating source for cooking (p=0.004), kitchen inside living room (p=0.001), improper ventilated house (p=0.003), roasting of soda in kitchen (p=0.001), current smokers of tobacco (p=0.043), intake of smoked fish (p=0.006), smoked meat (p=0.001), Soda (p<0.001) and GSTM1 null genotype (p=0.003) were significantly associated with increased risk of lung cancer among women in Mizoram. Significantly protective effect was observed for intake of bamboo shoots (p=<0.001) and egg (p<0.001). A clear increase in dose response gradient was observed for total cooking dish years. Risk for lung cancer tends to increase with collegial effect of indoor environmental sources (p=0.022). Significant correlation was also observed for interaction of GST polymorphisms with some of dietary habits.We confirmed the important role of exposure of cooking oil emission and wood smoke, intake of smoked meat, smoked fish and soda (an alkali preparation used as food additives in Mizoram) and tobacco consumption for increase risk of lung cancer among Women in Mizoram.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Respiratory Tract
