{"id":41508,"title":"Transoral incisionless fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.","abstract":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common and costly chronic medical condition affecting millions of patients. It is associated with substantial morbidity and negatively impacts quality of life. Reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus damages the esophageal mucosa and is associated with conditions including esophagitis and esophageal stricture. While GERD is most commonly seen in Western populations, changes in dietary patterns and the global increase in obesity have led to a pronounced increase in its prevalence worldwide. Medical and surgical GERD therapies are costly and pose considerable side effects, leading many to pursue effective endoscopic treatment options. Transoral incisionless fundoplication is an endoluminal procedure that offers patients a minimally invasive treatment option with the potential to eliminate the need for medical acid suppression with a low risk of side effects.
