{"id":52266,"title":"?-Glucosidase inhibitory activity of protein-rich extracts from extruded adzuki bean in diabetic KK-Ay mice.","abstract":"An extrusion process has been widely used for the development of many functional foods. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the extrusion process on the ?-glucosidase inhibitory properties of adzuki bean protein in type 2 diabetes model KK-A(y) mice. The extruded adzuki bean protein (EA) was prepared by adding 1% and 2% into the diet for 42 days. It was found that the fasting blood glucose concentration was significantly decreased with the EA-2 group compared with the control diabetic mice group. In addition, there was a significant decrease in serum triglyceride, blood urea nitrogen levels and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Meanwhile, hepatic lipids were improved and the content of ?-dicarbonyl compounds in the kidney were reduced in mice fed with EA. These results suggest that the intake of EA could moderate type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications.
