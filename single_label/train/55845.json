{"id":55845,"title":"Injection frequency and anatomic outcomes 1 year following conversion to aflibercept in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical, anatomic and functional effects of conversion to aflibercept following ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).A retrospective review of patients with neovascular AMD treated with intravitreal ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab who were switched to aflibercept was performed. The primary outcome was change in injection frequency in the year following the change. Secondary outcomes included change in central macular thickness (CMT) at 6?months and 1?year, presence of intraretinal and subretinal fluid at 6?months and visual acuity at 1?year.A total of 109 eyes with neovascular AMD were switched to aflibercept and met inclusion criteria. Overall, aflibercept injection frequency was unchanged with patients receiving 7.4 antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections the year prior to conversion compared with 7.2 aflibercept injections in the year following (p=0.47). However, the change to aflibercept was associated with improvement in CMT from 324 to 295??m (p=0.0001) at 6?months and 299??m (p=0.0047) at 1?year. There was no effect on visual acuity at 1?year. In a subgroup analysis, patients who had received ?10 anti-VEGF injections in the year prior had fewer injections (11.1 to 8.4, p<0.0001) and clinic visits (13.9 to 9.6, p<0.0001) as well as a significant decrease in CMT (-35??m, p=0.02).In our population, switching to aflibercept therapy was not associated with a change in injection frequency nor improved visual acuity, but was associated with improved CMT at 6?months and 1?year. In patients who received at least 10 anti-VEGF injections in the year prior, transitioning to aflibercept was associated with a reduced injection frequency and CMT, suggesting potential cost savings in this population.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795334","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.891685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.167499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.121183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Country Music Television","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Television"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"324","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/324"},{"name":"295","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/295"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Transitioning (transgender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_(transgender)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"}]}
