{"id":51802,"title":"Non-HDL cholesterol is an independent risk factor for aspirin resistance in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"We evaluated the prevalence of aspirin resistance and predictive factors for aspirin resistance in Korean type 2 diabetes patients.A total of 1045 type 2 diabetes patients from 11 hospitals who were taking aspirin (100 mg/day for ?2 weeks) and no other antiplatelet agents were studied to evaluate aspirin resistance. Aspirin resistance was measured in aspirin reaction units using VerifyNow(Â®). Aspirin resistance was defined as ?550 aspirin reaction units. Aspirin resistance was detected in 102 of the 1045 subjects (prevalence 9.8%). Aspirin resistance was associated with total cholesterol (P = 0.013), LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.028), and non-HDL cholesterol (P = 0.008) concentrations in univariate analysis. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only non-HDL cholesterol was associated with aspirin resistance in obese (BMI >25 kg/m(2)) type 2 diabetes patients (adjusted odds ratio 3.55, 95% CI: 1.25-10.05, P = 0.017).The prevalence of aspirin resistance in Korean type 2 diabetes patients is 9.8%. Non-HDL cholesterol is an independent risk factor for aspirin resistance, especially in obese type 2 diabetes patients.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657383","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.795798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.562133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.36461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.259376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.15263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Predictive inference","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"1045","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1045"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"}]}
