{"id":19622,"title":"Preventive measures for hospital infections in a \"nest\".","abstract":"The onset of an infectious complication in an infant leads to an increase in costs for the health of the newborn, psychological costs for the family, and economic costs for the hospital. Several studies have demonstrated that hospital infections are preventable in part: the adoption of \"safe\" care practices in fact involves the reduction of 35%. Essential principals for the prevention of nosocomial infections are: a particular attention to the care of the skin, of the umbilical stump and of the newborn's eyes, as well as of the tools for every-day use; the implementation of correct behaviors during washing of the hands; prevention of the spread of respiratory viruses; the environmental control; training courses for healthcare personnel and for infant's families.
