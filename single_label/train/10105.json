{"id":10105,"title":"Conservation of pathogenic TCR homology across class II restrictions in anti-ribonucleoprotein autoimmunity: extended efficacy of T cell vaccine therapy.","abstract":"T cells have been shown to mediate aspects of anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) autoimmunity, and are a potential target of therapy in lupus and related diseases. In this study, we assessed the relevance of a conserved class of anti-RNP T cells to autoimmune disease expression and therapy. Our data show that anti-RNP T cell selection induced a limited set of homologous CDR3 motifs at high frequency. Homologous CDR3 motifs have been reported in other autoimmune diseases. Vaccination with irradiated anti-RNP (but not anti-tetanus toxoid) CD4(+) cells induced remission of anti-RNP-associated nephritis in ? 80% of treated mice, even with donor/recipient MHC class II mismatch, and in both induced and spontaneous autoimmunity. Vaccine responder sera inhibited anti-70k T cell proliferation and bound hybridomas expressing the conserved CDR3 motifs. Our data indicate that a limited set of TCR CDR3 motifs may be important for the pathogenesis of anti-RNP lupus and other autoimmune diseases. The ability to target a consistent set of pathogenic T cells between individuals and across class II restrictions may allow for the more practical development of a standardized anti-RNP T cell vaccine preparation useful for multiple patients.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670800","annotations":[{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.834977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.782266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Hybridoma technology","weight":0.75392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridoma_technology"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.735738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.659865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Toxoid","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoid"},{"name":"Complementarity determining region","weight":0.571391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_determining_region"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.418003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Glomerulonephritis","weight":0.103779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequence motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
