{"id":74391,"title":"Science to practice: opening the blood-brain barrier with focused ultrasound-a potential treatment for Alzheimer disease?","abstract":"Burgess et al ( 1 ) present intriguing results of repetitive transient opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a transgenic mouse model of advanced Alzheimer disease (AD). The results underscore the potential of using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided focused ultrasound and microbubble ultrasonography (US) contrast agents for the disruption of the BBB as a potential long-term therapy to reduce amyloid plaque burden and improve cognitive performance. This daring conclusion that is based on an experimental animal model should now be confirmed in humans. Considering that the technology is commercially available and given the immense clinical need, clinical trials in this AD treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.","date":"2014-11-25","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420161","annotations":[{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.719171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.698359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.667691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.541587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.485558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.448425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.424008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Blood-brain barrier","weight":0.416632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"High-intensity focused ultrasound","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_focused_ultrasound"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Genetically modified mouse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_mouse"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
