{"id":29078,"title":"Populations at increased risk for HIV infection in Kenya: results from a national population-based household survey, 2012.","abstract":"Populations with higher risks for HIV exposure contribute to the HIV epidemic in Kenya. We present data from the second Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey to estimate the size and HIV prevalence of populations with high-risk characteristics.The Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey 2012 was a national survey of Kenyans aged 18 months to 64 years which linked demographic and behavioral information with HIV results. Data were weighted to account for sampling probability. This analysis was restricted to adults aged 18 years and older.Of 5088 men and 6745 women, 0.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03 to 0.14] were persons who inject drugs (PWID). Among men, 0.6% (CI: 0.3 to 0.8) had ever had sex with other men, and 3.1% (CI: 2.4 to 3.7) were males who had ever engaged in transactional sex work (MTSW). Among women, 1.9% (CI: 1.3 to 2.5) had ever had anal sex, and 4.1% (CI: 3.5 to 4.8) were women who had ever engaged in transactional sex work (FTSW). Among men, 17.6% (CI: 15.7 to 19.6) had been male clients of transactional sex workers (TSW). HIV prevalence was 0% among men who have sex with men, 6.3% (CI: 0 to 18.1) among persons who injected drugs, 7.1% (CI: 4.8 to 9.4) among male clients of TSW, 7.6% (CI: 1.8 to 13.4) among MTSW, 12.1% (CI: 7.1 to 17.1) among FTSW, and 12.1% (CI: 5.0 to 19.2) among females who ever had engaged in anal sex.Population-based data on high-risk populations can be used to set realistic targets for HIV prevention, care, and treatment for these groups. These data should inform priorities for high-risk populations in the upcoming Kenyan strategic plan on HIV/AIDS.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732821","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.735773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.650009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.543743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.528384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Kenya","weight":0.480374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.421447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.413399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.351152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.321874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.318048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sex worker","weight":0.314087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.200444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.168676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Transactional sex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_sex"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Strategic planning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_HIV/AIDS_adult_prevalence_rate"},{"name":"Realism (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
