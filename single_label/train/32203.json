{"id":32203,"title":"A novel dystrophin deletion mutation in a becker muscular dystrophy patient with early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a rare cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We present a 23-year-old patient with BMD and early-onset DCM in whom cardiovascular magnetic resonance showed extensive myocardial late gadolinium enhancement and previously unreported findings of subepicardial fat infiltration in the lateral wall. In addition, this patient carried a rare mutation of dystrophin gene that might be a new genetic predisposition to early-onset DCM in BMD.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996370","annotations":[{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.864532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.806372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.695561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.491718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.488225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Becker's muscular dystrophy","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becker's_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Dystrophin","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophin"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.120689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Theodor Becker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Becker"},{"name":"Membranous wall of tympanic cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membranous_wall_of_tympanic_cavity"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
