{"id":85722,"title":"Comparative efficacy of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist combinations in preventing COPD exacerbations: a Bayesian network meta-analysis.","abstract":"A combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) is recommended in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients experiencing frequent exacerbations. Currently, there are five ICS/LABA combination products available on the market. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the efficacy of various ICS/LABA combinations with a network meta-analysis.Several databases and manufacturer's websites were searched for relevant clinical trials. Randomized control trials, at least 12 weeks duration, comparing an ICS/LABA combination with active control or placebo were included. Moderate and severe exacerbations were chosen as the outcome assessment criteria. The primary analyses were conducted with a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method.Most of the ICS/LABA combinations reduced moderate-to-severe exacerbations as compared with placebo and LABA, but none of them reduced severe exacerbations. However, many studies excluded patients receiving long-term oxygen therapy. Moderate-dose ICS was as effective as high-dose ICS in reducing exacerbations when combined with LABA.ICS/LABA combinations had a class effect with regard to the prevention of COPD exacerbations. Moderate-dose ICS/LABA combination therapy would be sufficient for COPD patients when indicated. The efficacy of ICS/LABA combination therapy appeared modest and had no impact in reducing severe exacerbations. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of ICS/LABA combination therapy in severely affected COPD patients requiring long-term oxygen therapy.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872685","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.719202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.693902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Markov chain Monte Carlo","weight":0.637842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.635761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.575714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.565707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Monte Carlo method","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.494998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.431382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Bayesian network","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.286582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.24701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.216946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Bayesian probability","weight":0.200516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.12795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Markov chain","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Beta2-adrenergic agonist","weight":0.0528801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_agonist"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Beta distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution"},{"name":"Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-acting_beta-adrenoceptor_agonist"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"}]}
