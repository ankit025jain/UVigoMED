{"id":13136,"title":"Effects of melatonin on Wi-Fi-induced oxidative stress in lens of rats.","abstract":"Melatonin has been considered a potent antioxidant that detoxifies a variety of reactive oxygen species in many pathophysiological states of eye. The present study was designed to determine the effects of Wi-Fi exposure on the lens oxidant, antioxidant redox systems, as well as the possible protective effects of melatonin on the lens injury induced by electromagnetic radiation (EMR).Thirty-two rats were used in the current study and they were randomly divided into four equal groups as follows: First and second groups were cage-control and sham-control rats. Rats in third group were exposed to Wi-Fi (2.45 GHz) for duration of 60 min/day for 30 days. As in the third group, the fourth group was treated with melatonin. The one-hour exposure to irradiation in second, third and fourth took place at noon each day.Lipid peroxidation levels in the lens were slightly higher in third (Wi-Fi) group than in cage and sham control groups although their concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased by melatonin supplementation. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in Wi-Fi group than in cage and sham control groups although GSH-Px (P < 0.01) and reduced glutathione (P < 0.05) values were significantly higher in Wi-Fi + melatonin group than in Wi-Fi group.There are poor oxidative toxic effects of one hour of Wi-Fi exposure on the lens in the animals. However, melatonin supplementation in the lens seems to have protective effects on the oxidant system by modulation of GSH-Px activity.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492496","annotations":[{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Oxidizing agent","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.710553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Electromagnetic radiation","weight":0.691396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.67681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.676702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.627993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.54504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.452944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.414478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.408977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Lens (anatomy)","weight":0.401242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"}]}
