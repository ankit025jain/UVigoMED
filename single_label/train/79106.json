{"id":79106,"title":"Office-based injection laryngoplasty for the management of unilateral vocal fold paralysis.","abstract":"Office-based injection laryngoplasty (OBIL) is a common method of addressing glottal insufficiency. This retrospective chart review identifies the demongraphics, laterality, technique, success rate, injectates, and complications of OBIL performed over a 3-year period at a single institution.Retrospective chart review.All OBILs performed for the management of UVFP by the senior author over 3 years (2007-2009) were identified from billing records. The age, gender, laterality, underlying disease process, augmentation material, route of injection, and complications were recorded.Eighty-two OBILs were attempted on 57 patients. The most common route of access was transoral (85.6%). All OBILs were able to be completed. Injectates used were hyaluronic acid derivatives (57.3%), calcium hydroxyapatite (16%), and Cymmetra (16.5%). Three complications (3.7%) occurred. Thirty percent of patients ultimately elected for thyroplasty or ansa reinnervation, 22% found their condition to self-resolve, 14% died, and 25% were lost to follow-up.Using a variety of approaches, OBIL is possible in almost all patients. The single surgeon transoral route using a rigid angled telescope and curved injection needle was the most commonly used approach. Multiple injectates can be used and have good safety records. The final disposition of patients may be variable and warrants further investigation.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491502","annotations":[{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.541762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.335145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Hydroxylapatite","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Laterality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laterality"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Telescope","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Derivative (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Vince Foster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Foster"},{"name":"Tariff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"},{"name":"Warrant (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(finance)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Reinnervation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinnervation"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Disposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"}]}
