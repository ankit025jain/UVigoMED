{"id":43769,"title":"Predictive factors for lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer with signet ring cell histology and their impact on the surgical strategy: analysis of single institutional experience.","abstract":"The prognosis of early gastric cancer (EGC) with signet ring cell histology is more favorable than other undifferentiated gastric adenocarcinomas. An accurate assessment of potential lymph node metastasis is important for the appropriate treatment of EGC with signet ring cell histology. Therefore, this study analyzed the predictive factors associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with this type of EGC.A total of 136 EGC with signet ring cell histology patients who underwent D2 radical gastrectomy were reviewed in this study. The clinicopathologic features were analyzed to identify predictive factors for lymph node metastasis.The overall rate of lymph node metastasis in EGC with signet ring cell histology was 10.3%. Using a univariate analysis, the risk factors for lymph node metastasis were identified as the tumor size, depth of tumor invasion, and lymphovascular invasion. The multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size >2 cm, submucosal invasion, and lymphovascular invasion were independent risk factors of lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05).The risk of lymph node metastasis of EGC with signet ring cell histology was high in those with tumor sizes ?2 cm, submucosal tumors, and lymphovascular invasion. A minimally invasive treatment, such as endoscopic resection, might be possible in highly selective cases of EGC with signet ring cell histology with intramucosal invasion, tumor size <2 cm, and no lymphovascular invasion.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768142","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.914879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.711904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.61929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.588649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.247521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Signet ring cell","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring_cell"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.0113497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"}]}
