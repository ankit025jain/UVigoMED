{"id":13523,"title":"Translational realistic expectations of chronic cerebral hypoxemia in rat model after bilateral commom carotid artery ligation. Neurocognitive aspects.","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of chronic cerebral hypoxia on memory of rats submitted to bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCCL).Every each week, for 16 weeks, 31 rats were tested for memory using a water and land mazes and compared with 30 normal rats (control group A). The variables were expressed by their mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). p<0.05 was used for rejecting the null hypothesis. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for animal investigation.There was a significant increase in the latency time, in the survival water and land mazes, after four weeks (study group B) follow-up. However, without any medication or therapeutically induced measures, after 16 weeks (study group C) follow-up the latency mean times tend to be similar to control group (A) in the neurocognitive tests.Neurocognitive deficits after 16 weeks post-operative follow-up of rats that underwent bilateral common carotid artery ligation is a natural adaptive phenomenon. Thus, is not realistic to allow translational information from this animal model for therapeutically approaches aiming at to prevent, or to improve brain damage in human beings suffering from chronic deprivation of adequate blood supply.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474178","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Brain damage","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.786488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.711061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.573568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.403847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cerebral hypoxia","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hypoxia"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.316728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Null hypothesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis"},{"name":"Neurocognitive","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocognitive"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0259029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maze","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Philosophical realism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"}]}
