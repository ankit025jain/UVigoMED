{"id":46695,"title":"Amylase level in drains after pancreatoduodenectomy as a predictor of clinically significant pancreatic fistula.","abstract":"Amylase level in drains (ALD) has been proposed as a predictor for the development of a clinically significant pancreatic fistula (CS-PF) in patients undergoing a major pancreatic surgery. This study aimed to determine if the ALD in patients who developed a CS-PF after pancreatoduodenectomy is higher than that for patients with transient fistulae and to establish a threshold value as a predictor of a CS-PF.From January 2002 to December 2012, all patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy were enrolled. At least 1 ALD measurement on postoperative day 3 was obtained. Pancreatic fistula (PF) was defined according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula. Both grade B and C PFs were considered as a CS-PF. We determined the cutoff value with a receiver operating characteristic curve.A total of 135 patients were enrolled. Pancreatic fistula was diagnosed in 36 cases (26.7%). The ALD median values were the following: PF grade A, 1809 U/L; PF grade B, 19,710 U/L; and PF grade C, 27,590 U/L. A drain amylase value of 2820 U/L was determined to be the cutoff for the development of a CS-PF.Patients with CS-PF have higher values of ALD than patients who developed a mild/transient fistula. An ALD higher than 2820 U/L identifies patients likely to present a CS-PF.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622080","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Pancreatic fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_fistula"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.0257616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"1809","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1809"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"590","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/590"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Adrenoleukodystrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenoleukodystrophy"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"B movie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"GCE Advanced Level","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Study Group International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Group_International"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"}]}
