{"id":77697,"title":"Body pain in classical choral singers.","abstract":"To identify and characterize the presence of body pain related to voice usage in choral singers.A questionnaire investigating the occurrence of voice problems, vocal self-evaluation, and a report of body aches was given to 50 classical choral singers and 150 participants who were non-singers. Thirteen types of aches were investigated that were distributed into two groups: larynx proximal ache (temporomandibular joint, tongue, sore throat, neck, back of the neck, shoulder, and pain while speaking) and distal ache (headache, backache, chest, arms, hands, and ear ache).Classical choral singers had less presence of pain than the general population. The most related pain types reported in singers were sore throat, chest, and shoulder, respectively.Reduced vocal signs of pain in singers may suggest that singers can benefit from vocal training once they have better voice usage due to voice practice, offering a protective -effect to the development of voice disorders since voice training builds up a better musculoskeletal endurance.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24408480","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.791982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Otalgia","weight":0.645301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otalgia"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.637209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.593047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.540748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.492151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.349442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.260052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Vocal pedagogy","weight":0.235905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_pedagogy"},{"name":"List of voice disorders","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_voice_disorders"},{"name":"Choir","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Sore throat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Singing","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Endurance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"}]}
