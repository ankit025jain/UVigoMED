{"id":56538,"title":"Comparison of morphological and functional endothelial cell changes after cataract surgery: phacoemulsification versus manual small-incision cataract surgery.","abstract":"To compare the morphological (cell density, coefficient of variation and standard deviation) and functional (central corneal thickness) endothelial changes after phacoemulsification versus manual small-incision cataract surgery (MSICS).Prospective randomized control study.In this prospective randomized control study, patients were randomly allocated to undergo phacoemulsification (Group 1, n = 100) or MSICS (Group 2, n = 100) using a random number Table. The patients underwent complete ophthalmic evaluation and specular microscopy preoperatively and at 1and 6 weeks postoperatively. Functional and morphological endothelial evaluation was Noncon ROBO PACHY SP-9000 specular microscope. Phacoemulsification was performed, the chop technique and MSICS, by the viscoexpression technique.The mean difference in central corneal thickness at baseline and 1 week between Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically significant (P = 0.027). However, this difference at baseline when compared to 6 week and 1 week, 6 weeks was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The difference in mean endothelial cell density between groups at 1 week and 6 weeks was statistically significant (P = 0.016). The mean coefficient of variation and mean standard deviation between groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05, both comparisons).The central corneal thickness, coefficient of variation, and standard deviation were maintained in both groups indicating that the function and morphology of endothelial cells was not affected despite an initial reduction in endothelial cell number in MSICS. Thus, MSICS remains a safe option in the developing world.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669147","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.770092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.444734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.431022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.358524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.355957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.228042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.22199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.183187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.133981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Robo (musician)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo_(musician)"},{"name":"Coefficient of variation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Specular reflection","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Random number generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"}]}
