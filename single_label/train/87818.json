{"id":87818,"title":"Use of computed tomography for assessing bone mineral density.","abstract":"Assessing local bone quality on CT scans with Hounsfield unit (HU) quantification is being used with increasing frequency. Correlations between HU and bone mineral density have been established, and normative data have been defined throughout the spine. Recent investigations have explored the utility of HU values in assessing fracture risk, implant stability, and spinal fusion success. The information provided by a simple HU measurement can alert the treating physician to decreased bone quality, which can be useful in both medically and surgically managing these patients.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981903","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.745479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.496324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.462482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Spinal fusion","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_fusion"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.419673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.418034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.381232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.376251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.158871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hounsfield scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Godfrey Hounsfield","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Hounsfield"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
