{"id":23715,"title":"Nudging guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing: a randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"\"Nudges\" that influence decision making through subtle cognitive mechanisms have been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of applications, but there have been few experiments to improve clinical practice.To investigate the use of a behavioral \"nudge\" based on the principle of public commitment in encouraging the judicious use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections (ARIs).Randomized clinical trial in 5 outpatient primary care clinics. A total of 954 adults had ARI visits during the study timeframe: 449 patients were treated by clinicians randomized to the posted commitment letter (335 in the baseline period, 114 in the intervention period); 505 patients were treated by clinicians randomized to standard practice control (384 baseline, 121 intervention).The intervention consisted of displaying poster-sized commitment letters in examination rooms for 12 weeks. These letters, featuring clinician photographs and signatures, stated their commitment to avoid inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs.Antibiotic prescribing rates for antibiotic-inappropriate ARI diagnoses in baseline and intervention periods, adjusted for patient age, sex, and insurance status.Baseline rates were 43.5% and 42.8% for control and poster, respectively. During the intervention period, inappropriate prescribing rates increased to 52.7% for controls but decreased to 33.7% in the posted commitment letter condition. Controlling for baseline prescribing rates, we found that the posted commitment letter resulted in a 19.7 absolute percentage reduction in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing rate relative to control (P?=?.02). There was no evidence of diagnostic coding shift, and rates of appropriate antibiotic prescriptions did not diminish over time.Displaying poster-sized commitment letters in examination rooms decreased inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. The effect of this simple, low-cost intervention is comparable in magnitude to costlier, more intensive quality-improvement efforts.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474434","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.776043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.665631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.55895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.53624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.522338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.484048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.333641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.304526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0304399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Poster","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster"}]}
