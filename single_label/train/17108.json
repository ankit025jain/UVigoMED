{"id":17108,"title":"Immunoproteomic analysis of antibody response to cell wall-associated proteins of Candida tropicalis.","abstract":"This study was conducted to identify antigenic proteins of Candida tropicalis that are targeted by the host immune system.An immunoproteomic approach was used to discover antigens from cell wall of C. tropicalis that were recognized by sera from experimentally infected mice. This resulted in the identification of twelve distinct proteins, of which ten have been previously reported as antigens of Candida albicans. For the remaining two proteins, Idh2p has been described as an antigen of Candida parapsilosis, whereas Kgd2p is revealed for the first time as an antigenic protein for Candida species. These two antigens were expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and were shown to be specifically recognized by sera from infected host on Western blot.The present work investigated immunoproteome of C. tropicalis and identified several biomarker candidate antigens, with Kgd2p as a novel immunogenic protein that could be associated with pathogenesis of C. tropicalis.Findings from this study help to improve current understanding on host response to C. tropicalis infection and provide new insights into immune-pathogenesis of C. tropicalis. Besides, the immunogenic proteins could be considered as targets for the development of immunodiagnostic assay and/or vaccine.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909754","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.88416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.81888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell wall","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.727131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.706273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.634152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Candida tropicalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Immunodiagnostics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodiagnostics"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
