{"id":88057,"title":"Public bicycle share programs and head injuries.","abstract":"We evaluated the effect of North American public bicycle share programs (PBSPs), which typically do not offer helmets with rentals, on the occurrence of bicycle-related head injuries.We analyzed trauma center data for bicycle-related injuries from 5 cities with PBSPs and 5 comparison cities. We used logistic regression models to compare the odds that admission for a bicycle-related injury would involve a head injury 24 months before PBSP implementation and 12 months afterward.In PBSP cities, the proportion of head injuries among bicycle-related injuries increased from 42.3% before PBSP implementation to 50.1% after (P?<?.01). This proportion in comparison cities remained similar before (38.2%) and after (35.9%) implementation (P?=?.23). Odds ratios for head injury were 1.30 (95% confidence interval?=?1.13, 1.67) in PBSP cities and 0.94 (95% confidence interval?=?0.79, 1.11) in control cities (adjusted for age and city) when we compared the period after implementation to the period before.Results suggest that steps should be taken to make helmets available with PBSPs. Helmet availability should be incorporated into PBSP planning and funding, not considered an afterthought following implementation.","date":"2014-07-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922150","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.635569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.382248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.154971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Control city","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_city"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Bicycle sharing system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_sharing_system"},{"name":"Helmet","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Municipal corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation"},{"name":"Somnambulist (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnambulist_(Angel)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
