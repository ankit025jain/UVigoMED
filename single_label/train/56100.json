{"id":56100,"title":"Intravitreal dexamethasone implant for refractory macular edema secondary to vitrectomy for macular pucker.","abstract":"To study the efficacy of a single 0.7 mg dexamethasone intravitreal implant in vitrectomized eyes with refractory macular edema secondary to combined cataract extraction and macular pucker removal.In 8 eyes of 8 consecutive patients with refractory macular edema secondary to combined cataract extraction and 25-gauge vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling for macular pucker removal, the injection of the 0.7 mg dexamethasone implant was performed. Best-corrected visual acuity, central retinal thickness measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and intraocular pressure were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months.After a mean follow-up of 6.75 ± 0.71 months, best-corrected visual acuity was significantly increased (P < 0.0001) from 20/50 to 20/23 (P < 0.0001), mean central retinal thickness decreased significantly from 439 ± 45 ?m to 296 ± 49 ?m (P < 0.0001), and intraocular pressure changed significantly (P = 0.02) from 14.63 ± 1.19 to 16 ± 0.93. In no case postoperative hypotony or other complication was observed.A single injection of the 0.7 mg dexamethasone intravitreal implant resulted effective in the treatment of refractory macular edema secondary to combined cataract extraction and vitrectomy for macular pucker removal allowing a stable visual acuity recovery.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752008","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.869543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.698873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.663964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.571231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.470755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.354064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Epiretinal membrane","weight":0.298737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiretinal_membrane"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.11378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"2023","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"2050","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2050"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Pucker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pucker"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
