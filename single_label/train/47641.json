{"id":47641,"title":"[Research of the relationship of ubiquinone and beclin-1 and liver mitochondria].","abstract":"To study whether CO-Q10 can protect liver injury caused by acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) by autophagy.Rats were separated into three groups: control group, acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) and intervenient group, liver tissues were observed by optical microscopy and electron microscopy. The levels of Beclin-1 expression were determined by real-time PCR. And Western Blot.Areas of necrosis detected in intervenient group were alleviated than in ACLF significantly. Most mitochondrias had been degradated in ACLF group while alive in intervenient group. Real-time PCR and Western Blot revealed level of beclin-1 in ACLF was lower than control and intervenient group.Intervenient group may ameliorate rat liver injury by promoting autophagy.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579466","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Optical microscope","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_microscope"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Coenzyme Q10","weight":0.774293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.766623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.53705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.488031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.431504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.188519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
