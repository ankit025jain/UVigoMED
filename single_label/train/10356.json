{"id":10356,"title":"Pre-treatment with the NMDA receptor glycine-binding site antagonist L-701,324 improves pharmacosensitivity in a mouse kindling model.","abstract":"The glycine co-agonist binding site of the N-methyl-D-aspartat (NMDA) receptor is discussed as an interesting target for different central nervous system diseases. Antagonism at this co-agonist site has been suggested as an alternative to the use of non-competitive or competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, which are associated with a pronounced adverse effect profile in chronic epilepsy models and epilepsy patients. In the present study, we addressed the hypothesis that sub-chronic administration of the glycine-binding site antagonist L-701,324 might exert disease-modifying effects in fully kindled mice during a period with frequent seizure elicitation (massive kindling). Moreover, we analyzed whether L-701,324 exposure during this phase affects the subsequent response to an antiepileptic drug. L-701,324 treatment during the massive kindling phase did not affect ictogenesis. Mean seizure severity and cumulative seizure duration proved to be comparable between vehicle- and L-701,324-treated mice. Following withdrawal of L-701,324 seizure thresholds did not differ in a significant manner from those in animals that received vehicle injections. A low dosage of phenobarbital caused a significant increase of the generalized seizure threshold in the L-701,324 pre-treated group, whereas it did not exert a comparable effect in animals that received vehicle during the massive kindling phase. Analysis of P-glycoprotein in the hilus of the hippocampus revealed lower expression rates in L-701,324 pre-treated kindled mice. In conclusion, the data indicate that targeting of the NMDA receptor glycine-binding site does not result in anticonvulsant or disease-modifying effects. However, it might improve antiepileptic drug responses. The findings might be linked to an impact on P-glycoprotein expression. However, future studies are necessary to further evaluate the mechanisms and assess the potential of respective add-on approaches.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656981","annotations":[{"name":"Phenobarbital","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenobarbital"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Glycine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"NMDA receptor antagonist","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-D-aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.603714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.58524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.508151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Non-competitive inhibition","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-competitive_inhibition"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.279702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Seizure threshold","weight":0.0521591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure_threshold"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Kindling model","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_model"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
