{"id":71617,"title":"The role of texture analysis in imaging as an outcome predictor and potential tool in radiotherapy treatment planning.","abstract":"Predicting a tumour's response to radiotherapy prior to the start of treatment could enhance clinical care management by enabling the personalization of treatment plans based on predicted outcome. In recent years, there has been accumulating evidence relating tumour texture to patient survival and response to treatment. Tumour texture could be measured from medical images that provide a non-invasive method of capturing intratumoural heterogeneity and hence could potentially enable a prior assessment of a patient's predicted response to treatment. In this article, work presented in the literature regarding texture analysis in radiotherapy in relation to survival and outcome is discussed. Challenges facing integrating texture analysis in radiotherapy planning are highlighted and recommendations for future directions in research are suggested.
