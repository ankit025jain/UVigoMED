{"id":66241,"title":"The role of nanotechnology in prostate cancer theranostic applications.","abstract":"Recent advancements in cancer nanotechnology have facilitated a better way to diagnosis and provide therapy for prostate cancer. Nanotechnology has the potential to battle tumors at the site, where the cancer begins. There is a need to improve the therapeutic availabilities and the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapeutic agents for prostate cancer. Many therapeutic NPs have been developed with nanotechnology that can specifically target and deliver variety of agents including chemo drugs to destruct the prostate cancer cells without causing any damage to the healthy cells. Theranostic NPs have been developed to specifically target the prostate cancer cells using targeting ligands and to release the anticancer agents in a controlled and time-dependent manner for cancer therapy in combination with assisted imaging to monitor the effectiveness of the therapy in real time. The natural products and surface-modified polymers and metallic NPs have evolved as promising nanomaterials for targeted prostate cancer treatment. This review focuses on the role of alternative medicine, polymeric and metallic and metal oxide NPs in prostate cancer theranostics.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730302","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.507592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.394907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.351003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Nanomaterials","weight":0.280993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomaterials"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.185466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer therapy","weight":0.0516393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_therapy"},{"name":"Battle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
