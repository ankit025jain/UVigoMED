{"id":81126,"title":"Comparative evaluation of Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma intercalatum, and Schistosoma haematobium alkaline phosphatase antigenicity by the alkaline phosphatase immunoassay (APIA).","abstract":"To know if alkaline phosphatase (AP) from schistosomes other than Schistosoma mansoni can be used as diagnostic marker for schistosomiasis in alkaline phosphatase immunocapture assay (APIA), we comparatively tested n-butanol extracts of adult worm membranes from a Venezuelan (JL) strain of S. mansoni (Ven/AWBE/Sm); a Cameroonian (EDEN) strain of Schistosoma intercalatum (Cam/AWBE/Si) and a Yemeni strain of Schistosoma haematobium (Yem/AWBE/Sh). APIA was evaluated with sera of patients from Venezuela, Senegal, and Gabon infected with S. mansoni, from Gabon infected with S. intercalatum or S. haematobium, from Chine infected with Schistosoma japonicum and from Cambodian patients infected with Schistosoma mekongi. Results indicate that 92.5% (37/40) of Venezuela sera, 75% (15/20) of Senegal sera, 39.5% (17/43) of S. haematobium sera, and 19.2% (5/26) S. intercalatum sera were APIA-positive with the Ven/AWBE/Sm preparation. APIA with the Cam/AWBE/Si preparation showed that 53.8% of S. intercalatum-positive sera had anti-AP antibodies, and 51.2%?S. haematobium-positive sera cross-immunocapturing the S. intercalatum AP. APIA performed with Yem/AWBE/Sh showed that 55.8%?S. haematobium sera were positive. Only two out of nine S. japonicum sera were APIA-positive with the Ven/AWBE/Sm and Cam/AWBE/Si, and no reaction was observed with Cambodian S. mekongi-positive sera. AP activity was shown to be present in all the schistosome species/strains studied. The use of APIA as a tool to explore the APs antigenicity and the presence of Schistosoma sp. infections through the detection of anti-Schistosoma sp. AP antibodies in a host, allowed us to demonstrate the antigenicity of APs of S. mansoni, S. intercalatum, and S. haematobium.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452918","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.888734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Venezuela","weight":0.81416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela"},{"name":"Schistosoma haematobium","weight":0.796792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_haematobium"},{"name":"Schistosoma mansoni","weight":0.786017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_mansoni"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.675683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.65261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Senegal","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal"},{"name":"Gabon","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon"},{"name":"Yemen","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Cameroon","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"1743","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1743"},{"name":"1520","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1520"},{"name":"526","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/526"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Wireless access point","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point"},{"name":"Cambodia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Antigenicity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenicity"},{"name":"APIA Leichhardt Tigers","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APIA_Leichhardt_Tigers"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"}]}
