{"id":45174,"title":"Evaluation of the rapid test for human rotavirus A in Thai children with acute gastroenteritis.","abstract":"Rapid tests are widely used to detect rotavirus A; however, pediatricians are concerned whether the rapid test can still accurately detect the virus. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of the rotavirus rapid test by comparing it to the one-step RT-PCR method.Seven hundred fifty-five stool samples were collected from children with acute diarrhea. All samples were processed immediately after arrival with the SD BIOLINE rota rapid test and one-step RT-PCR method.The detection rates of rotavirus A were 40.79% and 41.91% for the rapid test and one-step RT-PCR, respectively. The rapid test had 93.57% sensitivity and 96.17% specificity. Most of the different genotypes of rotavirus A were detected with the SD rapid test.Although the rapid test is able to quickly give results, we found that it has high false positive and negative rates. Thus, other highly sensitive methods such as one-step RT-PCR are still required for true diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697131","annotations":[{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.784779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.673121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.470281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.448198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.366151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"False positive","weight":0.247773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Point-of-care testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-of-care_testing"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
