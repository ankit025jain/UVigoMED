{"id":28303,"title":"[Pharmacology of Raynaud's phenomenon].","abstract":"Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is characterised by transient ischaemia in the extremities in response to cold or emotions. It can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to an underlying disease. The pathophysiology of RP is multifactorial and complex. Microvascular impairment is a hallmark of the disease. The objective of this work is to review the different pharmacological treatments currently used in the management of RP, from their mechanism of action to the available evidence regarding their efficacy. We also propose to discuss potential pharmacological targets such as the potentiation of the nitric oxide pathway, or the inhibition of the RhoA-Rho kinase pathway. The last part of this review deals with drug-induced RP. Among various medications, beta-blockers, interferons, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors or cytotoxic agents such as bleomycin are involved.
