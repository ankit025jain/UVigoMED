{"id":18669,"title":"The association between blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier dysfunction and the therapeutic effect in tuberculous meningitis patients.","abstract":"To explore the correlation of blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCB) dysfunction with the therapeutic effect of antitubercular agents and their resistance, hoping to provide theoretical evidence for improvement of the therapeutic effect.Albumin in CSF and serum was assayed by IMMAGE. The CSF/serum albumin ratio (QALB) was used to evaluate the permeability of the BCB. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the amount of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA, and an MTBDRplus reagent kit was used to determine the type of drug resistance of the M. tuberculosis.The correlation analysis showed that significant correlation existed between the grade of severity of tuberculous meningitis and the QALB, and the grade of severity and the total leukocyte count in the CSF, for which the correlation coefficients were 0.366 (p < 0.05) and 0.365 (p < 0.05), respectively. The QALB in the group of patients who recovered was significantly higher than that in those patients who experienced disease progression (p = 0.019).Our study showed that the permeability of the BCB correlated with the cure rate in tuberculous meningitis. Specifically, in the treatment of tuberculous meningitis, it is of key importance to utilize the benefit of the permeability of the BCB to achieve a better outcome.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776964","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.805725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.745759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.714106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.679094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.643326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.568265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.516953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.243798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.121082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tuberculous meningitis","weight":0.0822457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculous_meningitis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0810573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"}]}
