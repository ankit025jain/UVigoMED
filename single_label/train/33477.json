{"id":33477,"title":"Atypical breakpoint in a t(6;17) translocation case of acampomelic campomelic dysplasia.","abstract":"Campomelic dysplasia (CD) is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), shortened and bowed long bones, airway instability, and the potential for sex reversal. A subtype of CD, acampomelic CD (ACD), is seen in approximately 10% of cases and preserves long bone straightness. Both syndromes are caused by alterations in SOX9, with translocations and missense mutations being overrepresented in ACD cases. We report a term infant with PRS, severe cervical spine abnormalities, eleven rib pairs, hypoplastic scapulae, and female genitalia. Chromosome analysis identified a 46,XY,t(6;17)(q25;q24) karyotype. FISH analysis with a series of BAC probes localized the translocation breakpoints to 6q27 and a region at 17q24.3 in the range of 459-379 kb upstream of SOX9. Therefore, this case extends the region classified as the proximal breakpoint cluster. In addition, the comorbidity of acampomelia, complete sex reversal, and severe spinal anomalies in our patient underscores the variability in the level of malformation in the CD/ACD family of disorders.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
