{"id":78664,"title":"[Clinical review of 33 cases of rhinitis medicamentosa by decongestant nasal spray].","abstract":"Long-term use of decongestant nasal spray (alpha adrenergic agonist) causes nasal congestion by rhinitis medicamentosa.We clinically reviewed the cases of 33 patients of rhinitis medicamentosa (23 men, 10 women; mean age, 44.4Â±15.6 years) treated with nasal steroid sprays instead of decongestant nasal sprays in our clinic from October, 2011 to December, 2012.Periods of drug use were generally long. Only 7 cases had a duration of use less than 1 year, and about half (48.5%) had a duration of use longer than 2 years. Causes of use included acute inflammation (n=6), chronic rhinosinusitis (n=2), and allergic rhinitis (n=20) and unknown cause (n=5). About two-third of the patients failed to answer questions concerning their use of decongestant nasal spray in a questionnaire prior to examination; therefore, careful observation was necessary. Among the 33 cases, 31 were followed up, all of whom showed improvement and stopped using decongestant nasal spays within 4 weeks. Periods for recovery were as follows: 3 days in 19 cases (61.3%) and 1 week in 25 cases (80.6%). Duration of drug use did not correlate with the period required for recovery; therefore, these results suggest that patients with long-term drug use are able to improve quickly.Rhinitis medicamentosa with nasal congestion appears readily reversible with suitable treatment.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608651","annotations":[{"name":"Rhinitis medicamentosa","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis_medicamentosa"},{"name":"Decongestant","weight":0.858226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decongestant"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.781123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Nasal spray","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.618477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.45351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Adrenergic agonist","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_agonist"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
