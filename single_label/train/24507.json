{"id":24507,"title":"[Use of infusion solution remaxol in the combination treatment of patients with leptospirosis].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficiency of using remaxol in the combination treatment of patients with leptospirosis.Thirty patients (29 men and 1 woman) with leptospirosis were treated with remaxol. The icteric and anicteric forms of the disease were diagnosed in 28 and 2 patients, respectively. Moderate, severe, and very severe leptospirosis were observed in 3, 24, and 3 cases, respectively. Remaxol was injected intravenously as a ready-to-use infusion solution 400 ml/day; the treatment duration was 3 to 9 days at the height of the disease.Clinical improvement and normalization of laboratory parameters were achieved in the course of the disease. There were no deaths. During early convalescence at 4-5 weeks of the disease, the patients taking remaxol at the height of the disease were substantially more rarely recorded to have general weakness, fever, anorexia, myalgia, leukocytosis, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hyperbilirubinemia than those untreated with this drug.The performed study established the clinical efficacy of remaxol when used in the combination treatment of patients with leptospirosis.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432601","annotations":[{"name":"Myalgia","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Leukocytosis","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.72815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Leptospirosis","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Hyperbilirubinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbilirubinemia"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Convalescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convalescence"}]}
