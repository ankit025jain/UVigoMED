{"id":76728,"title":"Associations between anxiety, depression, antidepressant medication, obesity and weight gain among Canadian women.","abstract":"Some mental illnesses have been suggested to be associated with obesity, although results are somewhat inconsistent and research has focused mainly on depression.Associations between anxiety, depression, medications for these illnesses, and obesity were investigated cross-sectionally among women aged 25-74 (n = 3004) who participated as population controls in a cancer case-control study. Participants self-reported information on anxiety, depression, height, current weight and weight at age 25.No association was observed between either anxiety or depression and either current overweight or obesity status. However, depressed women taking antidepressants were more likely to be obese [OR = 1.71 (95%CI ?=? 1.16-2.52) daily antidepressant use; OR = 1.89 (95% CI = 1.21-2.96) ever tricyclic antidepressant use]. In the full study sample consistent positive associations between anxiety, depression and obesity among women with a history of antidepressant use, and generally negative associations among women without, were suggested. Finally, weight gain was associated with history of anxiety [5-19 kg OR = 1.29 (95% CI = 1.06-1.57); ? 20 kg OR = 1.43 (95% CI = 1.08-1.88)] and depression [? 20 kg OR = 1.28 (95% CI = 0.99-1.65)].These results suggest depression and anxiety may be associated with weight gain and antidepressant use may be associated with obesity.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24932472","annotations":[{"name":"Tricyclic antidepressant","weight":0.908125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.800148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.561903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.525366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.30291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.128689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Tricyclic","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic"}]}
