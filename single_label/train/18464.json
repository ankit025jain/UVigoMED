{"id":18464,"title":"High-throughput characterization of Listeria monocytogenes using the OmniLog Phenotypic Microarray.","abstract":"High-throughput biochemical screening techniques are an important tool in phenotypic analysis of bacteria. New methods, simultaneously measuring many phenotype responses, increase the output of such investigations and allow a more complete overview of the bacterial phenotype, and how this may relate its genotype. This chapter describes the application of OmniLog Phenotype Microarray analysis, a high-throughput assay for the phenotypic characterization of bacterial strains across a variety of different traits, including nutrient utilization and antimicrobial sensitivity, to Listeria species.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792552","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.71151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.668899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.660471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.582474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.32345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.28576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.168519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.157007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Listeria monocytogenes","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Chapter (religion)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_(religion)"},{"name":"Output","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output"}]}
