{"id":65449,"title":"Estimating scenarios for survival time in men starting systemic therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised trials.","abstract":"We sought to estimate worst-case, typical and best-case scenarios for survival in men starting systemic therapies for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).We sought randomised phase 3 trials of systemic therapies for CRPC and recorded the following percentiles (represented scenario) from Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) curves: 90th (worst-case), 75th (lower-typical), 50th (median), 25th (upper-typical) and 10th (best-case). We determined the accuracy of using simple multiples of the median OS to estimate the other selected percentiles from each curve: 0.25 for 90th, 0.5 for 75th, 2 for 25th and 3 for 10th. Estimates were deemed accurate if within 0.75-1.33 times the actual value.We reviewed 23 trials (13,909 men) with 48 treatment groups including 28 of chemotherapy, and three of novel hormonal agents. In trials of first-line docetaxel, the mean (interquartile range) for median OS was 19 months (17-20), and for each scenario was: worst-case 7 months (6-8); lower-typical 12 months (11-13); upper-typical 29 months (27-31); and best-case 40 months (34-44). For trials of novel hormonal agents after chemotherapy the mean values were: median OS 17 months, worst-case 5 months, lower-typical 9 months, upper-typical 24 months and best-case not reported. Simple multiples of the median gave accurate estimates of the worst-case scenario in 72% of OS curves, lower-typical in 89%, upper-typical in 84% and best-case in 84%.Simple multiples of the median OS from randomised trials provided accurate estimates of worst-case, typical and best-case scenarios for survival time in men starting systemic therapies for CRPC.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825113","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.810658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.786648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.60715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.438789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.304081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.240727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"1720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1720"},{"name":"1113","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1113"},{"name":"909","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Actual cash value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_cash_value"},{"name":"90th United States Congress","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90th_United_States_Congress"},{"name":"75th United States Congress","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"WCWA World Heavyweight Championship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCWA_World_Heavyweight_Championship"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
