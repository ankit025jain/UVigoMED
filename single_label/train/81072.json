{"id":81072,"title":"A new species of Rhabdias Stiles et Hassall, 1905 (Nematoda: Rhabdiasidae) from Blommersia domerguei (Guibé) (Amphibia: Mantellidae) in Madagascar.","abstract":"Rhabdias blommersiae sp. n. (Nematoda: Rhabdiasidae) is described from the lungs of Domergue's Madagascar frog, Blommersia domerguei (Guibé) (Amphibia: Mantellidae), in Madagascar. The new species differs from congeners parasitizing amphibians in having a smaller body and buccal capsule, six equal lips, large excretory glands of unequal length and a posteriorly inflated body vesicle. A combination of characters distinguishes it from Afromalagasy species of Rhabdias Stiles et Hassall, 1905. Rhabdias blommersiae is the third species of the genus described from amphibians in Madagascar. Close similarities in the number and shape of circumoral structures in two Rhabdias species described from mantellid hosts in Madagascar suggest a close relationship and common origin of the two species, with subsequent adaptation to separate hosts within the Mantellidae.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471289","annotations":[{"name":"Frog","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.789093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Amphibian","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Speciation","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation"},{"name":"Madagascar","weight":0.7371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Common descent","weight":0.458217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.317115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.249844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Mantellidae","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantellidae"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"1905","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Congener","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congener"},{"name":"Hassall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassall"}]}
