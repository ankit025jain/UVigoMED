{"id":556,"title":"[Bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems and perspectives for their application in medicine: a review].","abstract":"The structure of various toxin-antitoxin (TA) families and the principles of their action are reviewed. TA loci are widely distributed in the genomes of eubacteria and archaea. Most TA systems are two-component and function in a similar way: a stable toxin alters vitally important cell functions and can be inactivated by a labile antitoxin.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434177","annotations":[{"name":"Archaea","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.757092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.638002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.337219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Antitoxin","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitoxin"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Territorial Army (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
