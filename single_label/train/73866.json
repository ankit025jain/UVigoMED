{"id":73866,"title":"Adjuvant exemestane with ovarian suppression in premenopausal breast cancer.","abstract":"Adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor improves outcomes, as compared with tamoxifen, in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.In two phase 3 trials, we randomly assigned premenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer to the aromatase inhibitor exemestane plus ovarian suppression or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression for a period of 5 years. Suppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of the gonadotropin-releasing-hormone agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation. The primary analysis combined data from 4690 patients in the two trials.After a median follow-up of 68 months, disease-free survival at 5 years was 91.1% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group and 87.3% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group (hazard ratio for disease recurrence, second invasive cancer, or death, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 0.85; P<0.001). The rate of freedom from breast cancer at 5 years was 92.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, as compared with 88.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group (hazard ratio for recurrence, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.80; P<0.001). With 194 deaths (4.1% of the patients), overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (hazard ratio for death in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.51; P=0.37). Selected adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported for 30.6% of the patients in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group and 29.4% of those in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group, with profiles similar to those for postmenopausal women.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881463","annotations":[{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Aromatase inhibitor","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Exemestane","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exemestane"},{"name":"Oophorectomy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oophorectomy"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.866597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Triptorelin","weight":0.771229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptorelin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.709619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.626864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.465028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Postmenopausal","weight":0.371182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmenopausal"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.17036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
