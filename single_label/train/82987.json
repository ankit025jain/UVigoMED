{"id":82987,"title":"Effect of maleic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid on the shear bond strength of RealSeal SE sealer to root canal dentin.","abstract":"Aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 7% maleic acid and 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the shear bond strength of RealSeal SE sealer to root canal dentin. Twenty incisors were split into coronal, middle and apical third and were treated in the following manner: Group 1: 5 ml of saline (1 minute). Group 2: 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (5 ml/min) followed by 79% maleic acid (5 ml/min). Group 3: 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (5 ml/min) followed by 17% EDTA (5 ml/min). Sealer was the placed on the root dentin and samples were subjected to bond strength measurement. There was no significant difference in bond strength between maleic acid and 17% EDTA in coronal & middle third. However, in apical third, 7% maleic acid showed higher bond strength. Least bond strength was observed with saline. Bond strength was maximum in apical third for both 7% maleic acid and 17% EDTA.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479211","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium hypochlorite","weight":0.75393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.6267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.523819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Salinity","weight":0.261032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity"},{"name":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid","weight":0.165579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid"},{"name":"Hypochlorite","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorite"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Maleic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleic_acid"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Seal hunting","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Bond strength","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_strength"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"}]}
