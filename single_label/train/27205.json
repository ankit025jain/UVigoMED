{"id":27205,"title":"[Factors significant for clinical-and-labor prognosis in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease after surgical myocardial revascularization].","abstract":"Factors significant for clinical-and-labor prognosis in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease after surgical myocardial revascularization are considered. It is demonstrated that each level of the problem in consideration has its own significant factors. Besides, the most essential correlations between investigated factors are marked out. The results obtained would allow determining clinical-and-labor prognosis for patients with ischemic heart disease more correctly and develop the efficient programs aimed at their rehabilitation.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051768","annotations":[{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.653261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.644641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.283876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.140456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
