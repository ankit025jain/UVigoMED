{"id":53932,"title":"High GMFG expression correlates with poor prognosis and promotes cell migration and invasion in epithelial ovarian cancer.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical significance of GMFG, a novel ADF/cofilin superfamily protein, and investigate its role in cell migration and invasion in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).The expression of GMFG in EOC tissues and ovarian cancer cell lines was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting respectively. The data were statistically analyzed for the associations of GMFG expression with clinicopathologic parameters and survival. In vitro cell migration and invasion assays were performed to determine the role of GMFG in cell migratory behaviors. The effect of GMFG on reorganization of actin cytoskeleton was investigated by immunostaining.GMFG was overexpressed in EOC. Up-regulated GMFG expression was closely correlated with advanced FIGO stage and chemoresistance of the disease. EOC patients with higher GMFG expression showed poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In vitro cellular assays revealed that GMFG promoted cell migration and invasion. GMFG expression altered actin cytoskeleton organization probably by interacting with the Arp2/3 complex.GMFG expression independently predicts poorer prognosis in patients with EOC. Ectopic overexpression of GMFG contributes to the malignant biological behavior of ovarian cancer cells.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486602","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.662436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.421762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.221984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.164951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Gynecology_and_Obstetrics"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"}]}
