{"id":32596,"title":"In vitro approaches to pharmacological screening in the field of atopic dermatitis.","abstract":"In vitro models are valuable for evaluating potential active ingredients and other molecules used in medications for atopic dermatitis (AD). However, finding appropriate in vitro models can be problematic. Our strategy was to set up different in vitro models that would mimic the pathomechanisms of AD. We describe five such models - the AD keratinocyte model, the AD reconstructed human epidermis model, the adaptive immunity model, the innate immunity model and the pruritus model - which we have used to evaluate a new ingredient for emollients derived from a biological extract. The models chosen provide useful data for the pharmacological characterization of active ingredients in adjunctive treatments for AD.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930566","annotations":[{"name":"Itch","weight":0.86097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.822029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.754943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.738704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.709484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.536827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.534903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Moisturizer","weight":0.288043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.287874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.268507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Active ingredient","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"}]}
