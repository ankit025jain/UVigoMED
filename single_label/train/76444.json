{"id":76444,"title":"Hepatic ABCA1 expression improves ?-cell function and glucose tolerance.","abstract":"Low HDL is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Hepatic ABCA1 is the rate-limiting protein in HDL biogenesis, and mice lacking hepatic ABCA1 (ABCA1(-l/-l)) have very low plasma HDL concentrations. To investigate the role of hepatic ABCA1 in glucose tolerance and ?-cell function, we used ABCA1(-l/-l) mice, which showed impaired glucose tolerance without changes in insulin sensitivity. Insulin secretion was reduced following glucose gavage. Ex vivo, glucose stimulated insulin secretion from ?-cells from wild-type (WT) and ABCA1(-l/-l) mice was similar. Insulin secretion was, however, reduced upon addition of ABCA1(-l/-l) serum to the medium compared with WT serum, whereas islets lacking ?-cell ABCA1 were not affected differently by ABCA1(-l/-l) or WT serum. After high-fat feeding, WT and ABCA1(-l/-l) mice showed no difference in glucose tolerance or insulin secretion, and serum from ABCA1(-l/-l) and WT mice fed a high-fat diet did not affect insulin secretion differently. We conclude that hepatic ABCA1 improves glucose tolerance by improving ?-cell function through both HDL production and interaction with ?-cell ABCA1. The beneficial effect of hepatic ABCA1 is decreased under metabolic stress. Increasing hepatic ABCA1 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for improving glucose homeostasis in diabetes.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028523","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.840688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.755171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Pulsatile insulin","weight":0.737987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsatile_insulin"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.70037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.684374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.639811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.224121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"ABCA1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCA1"},{"name":"Biogenesis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenesis"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Islet","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islet"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
