{"id":47619,"title":"Inflammatory bowel disease in women of reproductive age.","abstract":"Management of inflammatory bowel disease in women of reproductive age requires special attention. Even though fertility in women without previous pelvis surgery is similar to the general population, active disease at conception and during pregnancy can lead to unfavorable pregnancy and fetal outcomes. In general, most medications needed to treat inflammatory bowel disease are low risk during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Achieving and maintaining disease remission, patient education, and a multidisciplinary team approach is the key to a successful pregnancy.
