{"id":59283,"title":"Endometrial stromal sarcomas: immunoprofile with emphasis on HMB45 reactivity.","abstract":"We describe the morphologic and immunohistochemical features of 17 endometrial stromal neoplasms, 16 sarcomas, and one stromal nodule.We reviewed 35 cases interpreted as endometrial stromal neoplasms, but 17 high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) and one case of mixed endometrial sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma were excluded from the study. Data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program on low- and high-grade ESS for 1973 through 2003 were obtained.One uterine primary ESS had collections of clear cells (20%), while a metastatic ESS contained predominantly clear cells (90%). CD10 (88.2%) and smooth muscle actin (70.5%) were the most common positive immunohistochemical markers. The latter marker was located in the cytoplasm in 47% of the ESS and in the nucleus in 23.5%, a previously unreported feature. HMB45 was detected in 23.5% of the ESS, which contrasts with the 2% reported by other authors.The presence of clear cells and HMB45 reactivity does not justify the term perivascular epithelioid cell tumors for these neoplasms. Two of 17 patients with ESS died of metastatic disease. However, among 274 cases of ESS (all stages included) collected by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute during a 30-year period, the 10-year survival rate was 94%.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838330","annotations":[{"name":"National Cancer Institute","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Leiomyosarcoma","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyosarcoma"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.785592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.708685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.561564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.40156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Neprilysin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neprilysin"},{"name":"Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_Epidemiology_and_End_Results"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"}]}
