{"id":90963,"title":"A case of delayed presentation of thigh compartment syndrome.","abstract":"Thigh compartment syndrome is a rare and devastating process. It generally occurs within hours to days of a traumatic event, although cases have been reported nearly 2 weeks after the initial event.To evaluate the literature describing the timing between inciting event and presentation of thigh compartment syndromes, with a focus on delayed presentations of this rare condition. To describe the unique properties of thigh compartments, and finally, to review the anatomy and techniques needed to measure the compartment pressures of the thigh.A case of a 54-year-old man is presented. He sustained trauma to his thigh 17 days prior to presenting to our ED with severe, sudden-onset pain in his right thigh. Compartment pressures were measured and confirmed the diagnosis of compartment syndrome caused by two large intramuscular hematomas. No other contributing events were identified.Compartment syndrome in the thigh should be considered in patients with a concerning examination and a history of recent trauma. This particular case represents the longest reported time between injury and development of a thigh compartment syndrome.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560014","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.330597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Compartment syndrome","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_syndrome"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.0171701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
