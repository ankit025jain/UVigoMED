{"id":87661,"title":"Gene expression analysis in patients with traumatic anterior shoulder instability suggests deregulation of collagen genes.","abstract":"Shoulder dislocation occurs in 1-2% of the population. Capsular deformation is a key factor in shoulder dislocation; however, little is known about capsule biology. We evaluated, for the first time in literature, the expression of COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1 and COL5A1 in the antero-inferior, antero-superior and posterior regions of the glenohumeral capsule of 31 patients with anterior shoulder instability and eight controls. The expression of collagen genes was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The expression of COL1A1, COL3A1 and the ratio of COL1A1/COL1A2 were increased in all three portions of the capsule in patients compared to controls (p?<?0.05). COL1A2 expression was upregulated in the antero-superior and posterior sites of the capsule of patients (p?<?0.05). The ratio of COL1A2/COL3A1 expression was reduced in capsule antero-inferior and posterior sites of patients compared to controls (p?<?0.05). In the capsule antero-inferior site of patients, the ratios of COL1A1/COL5A1, CO1A2/COL5A1 and COL3A1/COL5A1 expression were increased (p?<?0.05). In patients, COL1A1/COL5A1 was also increased in the posterior site (p?<?0.05). We found deregulated expression of collagen genes across the capsule of shoulder instability patients. These molecular alterations may lead to modifications of collagen fibril structure and impairment of the healing process, possibly with a role in capsular deformation.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25042113","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.852729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.196515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.180988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.120328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Fibril","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril"},{"name":"Collagen, type I, alpha 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen,_type_I,_alpha_1"},{"name":"Collagen, type III, alpha 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen,_type_III,_alpha_1"},{"name":"Collagen, type V, alpha 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen,_type_V,_alpha_1"},{"name":"COL1A2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COL1A2"},{"name":"Deregulation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation"},{"name":"Dislocated shoulder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"CYP1A2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP1A2"}]}
