{"id":27670,"title":"Association of carotid intima-media thickness with leptin and apoliprotein b/apoliprotein a-I ratio reveals imminent predictors of subclinical atherosclerosis in psoriasis patients.","abstract":"Psoriasis patients are often susceptible to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including atherosclerosis. Traditional markers (biochemical and inflammatory) and diagnostic tools could detect occlusive but not subclinical atherosclerosis. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), has recently been recognised as a non invasive diagnostic tool for identification of premature atherosclerosis. Therefore we evaluated 80 psoriasis patients and 80 age sex matched healthy controls for serum leptin levels and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio (apoB/apoA-I ratio) in relation with CIMT of carotid artery. Carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaques were simultaneously measured by carotid sonography. Serum concentration of leptin and apolipoprotein were measured using enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) and nephelometry respectively. Raised CIMT correlated to age of onset of the disease, serum leptin and apoB/apoA-I ratio in psoriasis patients. Taking into account, values that were above the 75 percentile of the three markers (leptin, apoB/apoA-I ratio and CIMT) the odds ratio was 4.26 (2.06-8.80 CI). Leptin and apoB/apoA-I ratio showed significant cumulative association with CIMT. Results of predictive analysis supports measurement of CIMT along with estimation of serum leptin and apoB/apoA-I ratio for prediction of premature atherosclerosis in psoriasis patients.
