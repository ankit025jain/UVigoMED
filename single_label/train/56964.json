{"id":56964,"title":"[Endometrial vasculature in women with hydrosalpinx].","abstract":"To study the endometrial vasculature in women with hydrosalpinx and to determine a possible correlation between its state and the morphometric parameters of other structural components of the uterine mucosa.The endometrium was studied in 20 patients with primary tubal infertility in hydrosalpinx. A control group included 20 women with established fertility and a regular menstrual cycle with a good obstetric and gynecological history. The spectrum of morphometric parameters included the relative volumes occupied by the endometrial glands and glandular epithelium; the height of the integumentary epithelium; and the number of stromal cells per mm2. Stereometric (glandular-stromal, epithelial-stromal) indices and epithelium/glandular lumen ratio were calculated. The endometrial vasculature was estimated by immunohistochemical assay of CD31- and CD34-expressing cells.There was a decrease in the specific volume occupied by positively stained vascular endotheliocytes and a predominance of the stromal component of the endometrium over its epithelial one. Correlations were found between the degree of development of the endometrial vasculature and endometrial glands, which reflects their normal relationships in the proliferation phase. In the study group, the correlation between the height of the integumentary epithelium and the development of the endometrial vasculature was moderately positive, which was absent in the control group where this correlation was strong and positive. The findings are evidence in favor of the negative impact of hydrosalpinx on the uterine mucosa. The found changes in the main endometrial structural components (vessels, glands, and stromal cells) reflect impaired mucosal maturation processes during the proliferation phase. The substantial negative impact of hydrosalpinx has an effect on the height of the integumentary epithelium of the endometrium.The given data suggest that there are significant and complex endometrial changes in hydrosalpinx. Suppressed angiogenesis is one of the key moments in the chain of impairments in the preparation of the uterine mucosa for implantation.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases
