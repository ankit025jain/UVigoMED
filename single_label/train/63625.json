{"id":63625,"title":"Helical tomotherapy in oncodermatology: case report of circumferential cutaneous lymphoma treated by this optimized radiotherapy.","abstract":"Helical tomotherapy is a recent modality of intensity-modulated, rotational irradiation being developed for treatment of an increasing number of malignancies. It allows delivering an accurate treatment while sparing critical organs thus optimizing the therapeutic ratio. In particular, it allows treating some tumour locations that could not be efficiently irradiated through more conventional irradiation devices. We report the usefulness of this approach for the treatment of complex lesions such as circumferential cutaneous lymphoma of the trunk.
