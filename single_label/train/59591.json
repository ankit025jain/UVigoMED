{"id":59591,"title":"Clinical significance of microcytosis in patients with primary myelofibrosis.","abstract":"Microcytosis is a relatively frequent finding in primary myelofibrosis (PMF); however its prognostic significance is unknown. We identified factors associated with microcytosis in PMF and measured its impact on outcomes. Among 725 patients with PMF, 140 (19%) showed microcytosis. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with microcytosis were absence of prior therapy, low iron, low transferrin saturation (satTF), and splenomegaly. Among 375 untreated patients, low satTF and splenomegaly were associated with microcytosis. Overall, microcytosis was associated with a higher risk of transformation to leukemia (p=0.03), but not shorter leukemia-free survival. Microcytosis in PMF may be related to dysregulation of iron homeostasis.
