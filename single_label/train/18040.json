{"id":18040,"title":"The impact of patellar resurfacing in two-stage revision of the infected total knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"Evidence for optimal management of the patellofemoral joint in revision surgery for the infected TKA is limited. We reviewed 69 infected TKAs undergoing two-stage revision. Fifty four patellae were resurfaced, 11 had patelloplasty performed, two were augmented with trabecular metal, one had impaction grafting, and one knee underwent patellectomy. Average follow-up was 4.5 years. The patients that received patellar resurfacing at re-implantation experienced statistically significant improvements in KSS pain score, functional KSS, and patellar score (P < 0.03). One further patient treated with impaction grafting improved significantly in terms of pain and function. Patients treated with patelloplasty, trabecular metal augmentation, or patellectomy did not have significant improvements in clinical or functional outcome. Patient age, use of dynamic vs. static spacer, use of extensor mechanism release, and differences in Charlson index did not seem to statistically affect outcome. We recommend that every effort should be made to minimize patellar bone loss in first stage resection, as inability to resurface the patella at time of reimplantation may adversely affect patient outcome.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824187","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.773806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.643318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.558091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.517672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.317809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0322089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"TKA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKA"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"White noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Impaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaction"},{"name":"Treatise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Geology of Venus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Venus"}]}
