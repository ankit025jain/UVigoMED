{"id":28849,"title":"Adolescents: which risks for their life and health?","abstract":"This paper reviews emerging research findings related to the biological, behavioral, psychological and social processes that occur during adolescence. New research makes it possible to identify interactions among brain structures, hormonal production and behavioral impulses, that underpin and explain the connections with serious problems emerging during adolescence: behavioral disorders, substance abuse, risky sexual conduct, violence and other social disorders.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779278","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Sociology","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.783879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.740915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.621318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.512392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.362149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Neuroanatomy","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomy"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
