{"id":83415,"title":"MicroRNAs in Tfh cells: micromanaging inflammaging.","abstract":"MicroRNA (miR)-146a-deficient mice develop low-grade, chronic, and systemic inflammation, similar to inflammaging. Hu et al. (2014) demonstrate that the lack of miR-155 prevents the accumulation of Tfh cells and inflammaging in miR-146a-deficient mice. They identify Fosl2 as a functionally important target of miR-155 in Tfh cells.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25367565","annotations":[{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.132628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Wu Hu","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Hu"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Micromanagement","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement"}]}
