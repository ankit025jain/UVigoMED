{"id":39015,"title":"Radiological interventions in portal hypertension.","abstract":"The role of radiologists in the management of portal hypertension (PHT) had been confined to its diagnosis and treatment planning. However, with the advancements in the field of interventional radiology various minimally invasive techniques have been evolved for the management of portal hypertension and its complications such as recanalisation techniques, shunt creation and variceal bleeding control. Thus, with these technical advances, there is shift in the role of radiologist from diagnosis to management of portal hypertension. In this review, we discuss the nuances of various radiological interventions available for the treatment of portal hypertension.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25276900","annotations":[{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.750883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.623827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.264614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.158378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Emergency bleeding control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_bleeding_control"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Time in the Philippines","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_the_Philippines"}]}
