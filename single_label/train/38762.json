{"id":38762,"title":"A rare case of Goldenhar syndrome with radial aplasia.","abstract":"Goldenhar syndrome (GS) is a well-recognised condition characterised by variable degree of uni- or bilateral involvement of craniofacial structures involving first and second branchial arches manifesting ocular and auricular anomalies and also vertebral defect. This syndrome presents at birth and its exact aetiology is still unknown. The affections of the neural crest cells may have some role in the multiple malformations of the GS. We present a teenaged female case who attended the Orthopaedic Outpatient Department to receive handicapped certificate in Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital. She had multiple skeletal abnormalities, which included hemifacial microsomia, vertebral malformations in the form of scoliosis, distorted pelvis, but the most striking feature was the absence of thumb and aplasia of radius of left side. She did not suffer from any ocular or auricular abnormalities, neither from any cardiological, urogenital or gastroenteric ones. Radial defects associated with GS might represent a subset within this spectrum. Our case probably belongs to this subset, therefore is a very rare one.
