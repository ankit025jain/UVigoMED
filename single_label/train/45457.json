{"id":45457,"title":"Does CEA and CA 19-9 combined increase the likelihood of 18F-FDG in detecting recurrence in colorectal patients with negative CeCT?","abstract":"The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the role of 2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with increased tumor markers and negative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CeCT) results.Forty-three patients (27 male; median age 66 years, range 31-93 years) with increasing tumor markers and negative CeCT during follow-up for treated CRC underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT examinations. The serum values of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (n=29) and CA 19-9 (n=20) were normal after completion of treatment, with subsequent increasing concentrations.Among the 43 patients, (18)F-FDG PET/CT was true positive in 32 (74.4%), false positive in two (4.7%), false negative in one (2.3%), and true negative in eight (1%) patients. On the patient-basis analysis, (18)F-FDG PET/CT had a sensitivity of 97% (confidence interval: 0.82-0.99), a specificity of 80% (0.44-0.96), a positive predictive value of 94% (0.78-0.98), and a negative predictive value of 88% (0.5-0.99). There was no statistically significant correlation between CRC recurrence and CEA and CA19-9 levels (P=0.561 and 0.55, respectively). Only in the group of patients (n=6) with both tumor markers increased did (18)F-FDG PET/CT have 100% accuracy in revealing recurrent disease.(18)F-FDG PET/CT is highly sensitive in the diagnosis of recurrent CRC in patients with increasing levels of tumor markers and negative CeCT regardless of the type or level of tumor marker; however, the combination of elevated CEA and CA 19-9 increases the likelihood of (18)F-FDG in detecting recurrence.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681767","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.904095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.870774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.862219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"False positive","weight":0.814798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.721059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.66249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.592413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.582767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.301893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.21971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.160236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
