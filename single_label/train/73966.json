{"id":73966,"title":"Induction of CD8+ T-cell responses against subunit antigens by the novel cationic liposomal CAF09 adjuvant.","abstract":"Vaccines inducing cytotoxic T-cell responses are required to achieve protection against cancers and intracellular infections such as HIV and Hepatitis C virus. Induction of CD8+ T cell responses in animal models can be achieved by the use of viral vectors or DNA vaccines but so far without much clinical success. Here we describe the novel CD8+ T-cell inducing adjuvant, cationic adjuvant formulation (CAF) 09, consisting of dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA)-liposomes stabilized with monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG)-1 and combined with the TLR3 ligand, Poly(I:C). Different antigens from tuberculosis (TB10.3, H56), HIV (Gag p24), HPV (E7) and the model antigen ovalbumin were formulated with CAF09 and administering these vaccines to mice resulted in a high frequency of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. CAF09 was superior in its ability to induce antigen-specific CD8+ T cells as compared to other previously described CTL-inducing adjuvants, CAF05 (DDA/trehalose dibehenate (TDB)/Poly(I:C)), Aluminium/monophosphoryl lipid-A (MPL) and Montanide/CpG/IL-2. The optimal effect was obtained when the CAF09-adjuvanted vaccine was administered by the i.p. route, whereas s.c. administration primed limited CD8+ T-cell responses. The CD4+ T cells induced by CAF09 were mainly of an effector-memory-like phenotype and the CD8+ T cells were highly cytotoxic. Finally, in a mouse therapeutic skin tumor model, the HPV-16 E7 antigen formulated in CAF09 significantly reduced the growth of already established subcutaneous E7-expressing TC-1 tumors in 38% of the mice and in a corresponding prophylactic model 100% of the mice were protected. Thus, CAF09 is a potent new adjuvant which is able to induce CD8+ T-cell responses against several antigens and to enhance the protective efficacy of an E7 vaccine both in a therapeutic and in a prophylactic tumor model.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24877765","annotations":[{"name":"Glycerol","weight":0.924245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis
