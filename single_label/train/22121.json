{"id":22121,"title":"Vacuum-assisted closure system in treatment of postoperative mediastinitis.","abstract":"Post-cardiac surgery mediastinitis is a serious complication with high morbidity and high financial costs. Using a vacuum-assisted closure system is the established line of treatment for mediastinitis, which improves outcome, especially in the high-risk group of patients.From January 2007 to April 2011, a retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the outcome of vacuum-assisted closure in the treatment of postoperative mediastinitis.There were 34 patients; 27 were male and 7 female. Mean time from infection to vacuum-assisted closure was 3.34?±?1.10 days. The duration of vacuum-assisted closure was 6.51?±?1.85 days (3-9 days). The mean amount of discharge was 759.60?±?175.28?mL (range, 354-990?mL). Of the 34 patients, 21 (61.76%) had direct surgical wound closure and 13 (41.16%) had re-wiring. Two patients had bilateral pectoral flaps. One patient had chronic fistula formation, and one had a tear in the right ventricle. Mean hospital stay was 11.28?±?2.09 days (range, 6-16 days).Vacuum-assisted closure therapy is a safe, reliable, and cost-effective modality of treatment for postoperative mediastinitis. It improves the outcome and can be combined with other modalities of conventional treatment, especially in high-risk groups such as the elderly or patients with diabetes.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569330","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.615797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.516104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Mediastinitis","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinitis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"759","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/759"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"341","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/341"},{"name":"Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Closure operator","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_operator"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Pectoralis major muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoralis_major_muscle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"}]}
