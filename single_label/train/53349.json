{"id":53349,"title":"[Diabetes mellitus and autoimmune neuropathy].","abstract":"The term \"diabetic neuropathy\" refers to many varieties of neuropathies, including diabetic peripheral neuropathies (DPNs). DPNs are categorized into generalized and focal/multifocal varieties. Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) and diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) are typical DPNs, and their development is clearly linked to hyperglycemia and subsequent metabolic and ischemic change. On the other hand, other forms of neuropathy, including multifocal diabetic neuropathies (e.g., lumbosacral, thoracic, and cervical radiculoplexus neuropathies) are thought to be associated with inflammatory or immune processes. Diabetic patients can also develop chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). CIDP in diabetic patients (DM-CIDP) should be ruled out, especially in patients with advanced DSPN. Recently, it was reported that diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies as well as CIDP respond favorably to immunotherapy. Thus, these immune-mediated diabetic neuropathies are treatable, and should be differentiated from advanced DSPN.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523312","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.807743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.734911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dysautonomia","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.687357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Myelin","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.55922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.353709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.169228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
