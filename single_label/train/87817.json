{"id":87817,"title":"Cement augmentation in vertebral burst fractures.","abstract":"As a result of axial compression, traumatic vertebral burst fractures disrupt the anterior column, leading to segmental instability and cord compression. In situations with diminished anterior column support, pedicle screw fixation alone may lead to delayed kyphosis, nonunion, and hardware failure. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty (balloon-assisted vertebroplasty) have been used in an effort to provide anterior column support in traumatic burst fractures. Cited advantages are providing immediate stability, improving pain, and reducing hardware malfunction. When used in isolation or in combination with posterior instrumentation, these techniques theoretically allow for improved fracture reduction and maintenance of spinal alignment while avoiding the complications and morbidity of anterior approaches. Complications associated with cement use (leakage, systemic effects) are similar to those seen in the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures; however, extreme caution must be used in fractures with a disrupted posterior wall.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981904","annotations":[{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.436565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.273272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.149224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.126925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Anterior horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Spinal cord compression","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_compression"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Hardware","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Instrumentation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(music)"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Human enhancement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
