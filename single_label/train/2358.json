{"id":2358,"title":"Soluble CD163, a specific macrophage activation marker, is decreased by anti-TNF-? antibody treatment in active inflammatory bowel disease.","abstract":"Activated macrophages shed the haemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger receptor CD163 into the circulation as soluble(s)-CD163. We measured sCD163 as an in vivo macrophage activation marker in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) receiving antitumour necrosis factor (TNF)-? antibody or prednisolone treatment. We also investigated the CD163 expression on circulating monocytes. 58 patients with CD, 40 patients with UC and 90 healthy controls (HC) were included. All patients had active disease at inclusion and were followed for 6 weeks of anti-TNF-? antibody or prednisolone treatment. We measured plasma sCD163 levels at baseline, 1 day, 1 week and 6 weeks after initiating treatment. CD163 expression on circulating CD14(+) monocytes was measured in 21 patients with CD receiving anti-TNF-? antibody treatment. Baseline sCD163 levels were elevated in patients with CD [1.99 (1.80-2.18) mg/l] and in patients with UC [2.07 (1.82-2.32) mg/l] compared with HC [1.51 (1.38-1.63) mg/l] (P < 0.001). Anti-TNF-? antibody treatment induced a rapid decrease in sCD163 levels in patients with CD and in patients with UC 1 day after treatment initiation (P < 0.05). One week of prednisolone treatment did not induce a reduction in sCD163 levels. Anti-TNF-? treatment normalized sCD163 levels in patients with UC, whereas patients with CD exhibited sustained increased sCD163 levels. In patients with CD, CD163 expression on CD14(+) monocytes was increased compared with HC. This study highlights that active CD and UC are associated with increased macrophage activation, as indicated by elevated sCD163 levels and monocytic CD163 expression. Anti-TNF-? antibody treatment induced a rapid decrease in sCD163 levels, suggesting a specific effect on macrophage activation in inflammatory bowel diseases.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25346048","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Scavenger receptor","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_receptor"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"CD14","weight":0.676142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD14"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.405489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.387785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Scavenger","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"}]}
