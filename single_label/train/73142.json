{"id":73142,"title":"The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with local recurrence or in-transit metastasis of melanoma.","abstract":"From January 2003 to March 2010, a prospective study was undertaken at the National Cancer Research Institute of Genoa in 15 patients with melanoma who had local recurrence (LR) or a few (? 3) in-transit metastases and clinically-negative regional lymph nodes with the aim of defining: i) the feasibility of sentinel node re-staging (r-sN) of the regional nodal basin; ii) the prognostic value of sentinel node status, and iii) the potential benefit in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with an histologically-positive sentinel node undergoing therapeutic regional lymph node dissection. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed to identify the r-sN: the radiotracer was intra-dermally injected around the LR or in-transit metastasis. Moreover, 10 min prior to the operative procedure, 0.5 ml intradermal injection of Patent-Blue-V dye was given around each LR or in-transit metastasis site, so that r-sN identification was achieved by both visualization of the nodal blue dye staining and the information supplied by gamma-detection probe. At least one sentinel node was intra-operatively identified in each patient, and a tumor-positive r-sN was required in four out of fifteen patients. The interval between the diagnosis of primary melanoma and the onset of recurrence was longer, although not significantly, in patients with tumor-negative r-sN, a compared to tumor-positive r-sN (49 ± 47 months vs. 25 ± 19 months, p=0.342). There was a trend toward an improved 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with tumor-negative r-sN a compared to tumor-positive r-sN. Hence, the r-sN proved to be a feasible and accurate staging procedure even in patients with a few localizations of LR or in-transit metastases (? 3). r-sN identified those with a more favorable prognosis, supporting an aggressive therapeutic approach in the natural history of their disease; moreover, an unnecessary regional lymph node dissection was safely avoided in 11 out of 15 73.3% patients because they had a tumor-negative r-sN.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922694","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.641092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.453887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.448635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.255405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.206031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cancer research","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research"},{"name":"Genoa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa"},{"name":"National Cancer Research Institute","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Research_Institute"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Sentinel (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_(comics)"},{"name":"342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/342"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Localization of a ring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_ring"},{"name":"Cobalt blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_blue"},{"name":"Natural history of disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history_of_disease"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Sentinel node","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_node"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
