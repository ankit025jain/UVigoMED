{"id":2942,"title":"Promoting preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum care following bariatric surgery: a best practice planning toolkit for patients and their physicians.","abstract":"Most bariatric procedures are performed in reproductive-aged women. Managing sequelae of postoperative anatomic and physiologic changes can be complex, particularly in women. Standardizing preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum management may limit practice variation and improve pore. We therefore provide a clinical toolkit consisting of physician checklists and corresponding written patient educational material to achieve these goals.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552132","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.835806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.168244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.128889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"List of toolkits","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_toolkits"},{"name":"Sweat gland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland"},{"name":"Pre-conception counseling","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-conception_counseling"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"}]}
