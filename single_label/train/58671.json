{"id":58671,"title":"Birth experience of women conceiving with assisted reproduction: a prospective multicenter study.","abstract":"To determine how infertility and subsequent assisted reproductive treatment (ART) affect a woman's childbirth experience.Prospective multicenter case-control study.We recruited women pregnant with a singleton fetus after either ART (n = 324) or spontaneous conception (n = 304) from five infertility clinics and one university maternity clinic in Finland.We studied their childbirth experience with the Delivery Satisfaction Scale. We compared how psychosocial and obstetric factors affected satisfaction and dissatisfaction with childbirth between and within the ART and the control group. Logistic regression was then used to analyse the most important contributors to the experienced dissatisfaction.Dissatisfaction with childbirth was as common in the ART group (11%) as in the control (10%) group. In the ART group, the women's education level, cesarean section (CS) and their partner's absence from the delivery were associated with dissatisfaction. In the control group, significant factors for dissatisfaction were nulliparity, severe pregnancy-related anxiety, emergency CS, recalled intense pain and the partner's absence from the delivery. According to adjusted logistic regression analysis of the whole sample, the independent risk factors were elective CS [odds ratio (OR) 5.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-14.1] and emergency CS (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.5), recalled intense pain (OR 6.8; 95% CI 3.3-16.2) and the partner's absence from the delivery (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.1-7.3).ART is not a risk factor for dissatisfaction with childbirth by itself. However, the contributors to an unsatisfactory childbirth differ partly between women conceiving with ART and those conceiving spontaneously.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909073","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.858291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.772356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.757634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.754497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.424789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.390373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.355867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"University","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesbian","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Tokophobia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokophobia"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
