{"id":63160,"title":"Inhibition of lymphoma vascularization and dissemination by estrogen receptor ? agonists.","abstract":"Most lymphomas show an increased incidence and poorer prognosis in males vs females, suggesting endocrine regulation. We have previously shown that tumor growth in vivo of a murine T-cell-derived lymphoma is repressed following activation of estrogen receptor ? (ER?, ESR2). By using ER?-deficient mice, we now demonstrate that this inhibition is mediated via a direct effect on the tumor cells and not on the microenvironment. Furthermore, we show that the growth-suppressing effects of ER? agonist are also valid for human B-cell lymphomas as demonstrated in tumors derived from Granta-519 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and Raji Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells. In Granta-519 MCL tumors, activation of ER? reduced expression of BAFF and GRB7, 2 important molecules involved in B-cell proliferation and survival. Importantly, activation of ER? inhibited angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, possibly mediated by impaired vascular endothelial growth factor C expression. Furthermore, using disseminating Raji BL cells, we show that ER? activation reduces dissemination of grafted Raji BL tumors. We also show by immunohistochemistry that ER? is expressed in primary MCL tissue. These results suggest that targeting ER? with agonists may be valuable in the treatment of some lymphomas, affecting several aspects of the malignant process, including proliferation, vascularization, and dissemination.
