{"id":64643,"title":"Levels of somatic hypermutations in B cell receptors increase during childhood.","abstract":"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is an important step in antigen-driven B cell development creating B lymphocytes expressing high-affinity antibody receptors. It is known that the peripheral B lymphocyte compartments of healthy children and adults differ considerably. However, the development of SHM with age has not been studied in detail previously. Therefore, we used the immunoglobulin (Ig)?-restriction enzyme hot-spot mutation assay (Ig?-REHMA) to gain an estimation of SHM levels in different age groups in order to relate this to the size of the memory B lymphocyte subpopulations. We show that the level of SHM increases rapidly during the first 2 years of life. This reflects the changes of the memory B cell subpopulations, but also changes in the SHM within memory B cell subsets, probably reflecting an increase of secondary memory B cell responses.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25039369","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.878524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Somatic hypermutation","weight":0.717907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Memory B cell","weight":0.432992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.330676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.281543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.168416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Hotspot (geology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_(geology)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"}]}
