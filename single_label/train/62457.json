{"id":62457,"title":"TGF-? upregulates CD70 expression and induces exhaustion of effector memory T cells in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","abstract":"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) has an important role in mediating T-cell suppression in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, the underlying mechanism responsible for TGF-?-mediated inhibition of effector memory T (Tm) cells is largely unknown. As reported here, we show that exhaustion is a major mechanism by which TGF-? inhibits Tm cells, and TGF-? mediated exhaustion is associated with upregulation of CD70. We found that TGF-? upregulates CD70 expression on effector Tm cells while it preferentially induces Foxp3 expression in naive T cells. CD70 induction by TGF-? is Smad3-dependent and involves IL-2/Stat5 signaling. CD70+ T cells account for TGF-?-induced exhaustion of effector Tm cells. Both TGF-?-induced and preexisting intratumoral CD70+ effector Tm cells from B-cell NHL have an exhausted phenotype and express higher levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 compared with CD70- T cells. Signaling transduction, proliferation and cytokine production are profoundly decreased in these cells, and they are highly susceptible to apoptosis. Clinically, intratumoral CD70-expressing T cells are prevalent in follicular B-cell lymphoma (FL) biopsy specimens, and increased numbers of intratumoral CD70+ T cells correlate with an inferior patient outcome. These findings confirm TGF-?-mediated effector Tm cell exhaustion as an important mechanism of immune suppression in B-cell NHL.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569779","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers_against_decapentaplegic_homolog_3"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.793471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor beta","weight":0.751686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor_beta"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.750836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Memory T cell","weight":0.661256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.59418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.526962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.422724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.396052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Naive T cell","weight":0.12173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_T_cell"},{"name":"R-SMAD","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-SMAD"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Nucleic acid thermodynamics","weight":0.0527294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"STAT5","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT5"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Signal (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(physiology)"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
