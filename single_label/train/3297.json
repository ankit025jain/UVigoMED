{"id":3297,"title":"[Demonstration of nested case-control study design in mechanisms research of allergic reaction of tanreqing injection].","abstract":"The paper is focused on the clinical applications of Tanreqing injection after listing, detecting and analyzing the related blood indicators of patients with allergic reactions based on prospective, multi-center, large sample, registration-type clinical safety monitoring nested case-control study (NCCS) to explore the possible mechanisms of allergic reaction of Tanreqing injection, 3 006 patients cases used with Tanreqing injection were monitored, including 3 cases of adverse reactions and 2 cases of allergic reactions. Each patient of allergic reactions, according to the ratio of 1:4 matches four cases of not adverse reactions as a control group of patients, while 5 healthy and 5 cases of volunteers into the healthy group. We examined the correlation detection of cases of allergic reactions among groups such as T-IgE, IgA, IgG, C3, C4, IFN-g, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10. Allergic reactions of Tanreqing injection may be mediated by IgE as type I based on existing research data. This results and conclusions will promote the justifiability and safety of clinical applications.","date":"2014-12-23","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25532397","annotations":[{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.729321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.657446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.588286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.533837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.408914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.248859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.240554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.229709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.102124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"C4 carbon fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Safety monitoring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_monitoring"},{"name":"Complement component 3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_3"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Demonstration (people)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(people)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"National Center for Constitutional Studies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Constitutional_Studies"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Type I hypersensitivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_hypersensitivity"}]}
