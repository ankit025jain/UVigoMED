{"id":22019,"title":"[The hazards of hospitals and selected public buildings of Legionella pneumophila].","abstract":"The registered infection and outbreaks of epidemic tend to monitor potential reservoirs of Legionella infection. According to the Act of 29 March 2007 on the requirements for the quality of water intended for human consumption are required to test for the presence and number of Legionella in the water system of hospitals. In case of detection of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (SG 1) or increased above normal number other serogroups of bacteria it is necessary to eradicate these bacteria from the water system. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of contamination of the water supply system of selected public buildings and analyze the effectiveness of disinfection methods for the elimination of L. pneumophila in hot water systems.The materials for this study were hot and cold water samples which were collected from the water supply system of 23 different objects. Enumeration of Legionella bacteria in water samples was determined by membrane filtration (FM) and/or by surface inoculation methods according to the standards: PN-ISO 11731: 2002: \"The quality of the water. Detection and enumeration of Legionella\" and PN-EN ISO 11731-2: 2008: \"Water quality--Detection and enumeration of Legionella--Part 2: Methodology of membrane filtration for water with a small number of bacteria\".L. pneumophila was present in 164 samples of hot water, which accounted for 76.99%. In all tested water samples L. pneumophila SG 2-14 strains were detected. The most virulent strain--L. pneumophila SG 1 was not detected. In examined 23 objects in 12 of L. pneumophila exceed acceptable levels > 100 CFU/100 ml.The presence of L. pneumophila SG 2-14 demonstrated in all examined objects, indicating the risk of infection, and the need for permanent monitoring of the water system supply. The thermal disinfection is the most common, inexpensive, and effective method of control of L. pneumophila used in examined objects, but does not eliminate bacterial biofilm. Disinfection using the filters stopped of L. pneumophila, and was the method of complementary thermal disinfection. Chlorine dioxide is a very effective biocide for large numbers of L. pneumophila in water systems.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575645","annotations":[{"name":"Biocide","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocide"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Chlorine dioxide","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_dioxide"},{"name":"Legionella","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionella"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.794493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.534623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.508556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.480046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Legionella pneumophila","weight":0.403889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionella_pneumophila"},{"name":"Water quality","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Water supply network","weight":0.312672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_network"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.29479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.232977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Water filter","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_filter"},{"name":"Water supply","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.202068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cross-flow filtration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-flow_filtration"},{"name":"International Organization for Standardization","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization"},{"name":"Building","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building"},{"name":"Water heating","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_heating"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Elimination reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_reaction"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"}]}
