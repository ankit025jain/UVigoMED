{"id":85191,"title":"Outcome of ultrasound-guided small-bore catheter drainage in exudative pleural effusions.","abstract":"To evaluate the outcome and safety of ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage of exudative pleural effusion.The present study was a retrospective analysis of 412 pleural effusions from 373 patients that underwent ultrasound-guided small-bore catheter drainage in exudative pleural effusions between 2004 and 2009.The two most common causes for drainage were parapneumonic effusion or empyema (52.2%) and malignant effusion (30.3%), while the remains were trauma, iatrogenic, and others. Overall clinical success rate was 76.5%. The success rate was lower among malignant pleural effusion (p = 0.003). Causes of effusion were the only independent predictors related to success. Only five (1.2%) patients developed complication during the procedure. Seventy-five of 412 effusions (15.8%) developed complication during the period of drainage; the majority were drain blockage (9%) and accidental dislodgment (4.1%).Ultrasound-guided small-bore catheter drainage was a safe and efficient procedure for exudative pleural effusions.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065096","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.578049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.493174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.359945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.211293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.0704441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Empyema","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyema"},{"name":"Computational complexity theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"}]}
