{"id":89492,"title":"The Hartford Consensus to improve survivability in mass casualty events: Process to policy.","abstract":"The Joint Committee to Create a National Policy to Enhance Survivability from Mass Casualty Shooting Events was formed to make recommendations to improve survival from intentional mass casualty incidents. This article describes the development of the Hartford Consensus and the process used to disseminate and implement its findings.Members of the Committee included individuals from select public safety organizations. The first meeting of the Committee was held on April 2, 2013, and a second meeting was held on July 11, 2013. Attendance at the second meeting was enlarged and included representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Security Staff of the Office of the President. The results of these meetings became known as the Hartford Consensus.The ideas generated at the meetings produced two documents, one from each meeting. These are referred to as Hartford Consensus I and II. Hartford Consensus I is a concept document and Hartford Consensus II is a call to action that no one should die from uncontrolled bleeding. The recommendations are being incorporated into training programs and have been endorsed by many organizations whose members are involved in the response to mass casualty incidents.The Joint Committee to Create a National Policy to Enhance Survivability from Mass Casualty Shooting Events was successful in stimulating policy to bring about change. Training and resources including tourniquets and hemostatic dressing are being directed to help ameliorate the unfortunate reality of intentional mass injury.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Wounds
