{"id":92335,"title":"Advances in small joint arthroplasty of the hand.","abstract":"Substantial effort has been directed at the development of small joint prostheses for the hand. Despite advances in prosthetic joint design, outcomes have been relatively unchanged over the past 60 years. Pain relief and range of motion achieved after surgery have yet to mirror the success of large joint arthroplasty. Innovations in biotechnology and stem cell applications for damaged joint surfaces may someday make prostheses obsolete. The purpose of this review is to describe the current status, ongoing advances, and future of small joint arthroplasty of the hand.","date":"2014-11-22","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415093","annotations":[{"name":"Biotechnology","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.153857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.150192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0617798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Mirror","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Substantial (rapper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_(rapper)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Obsolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsolescence"}]}
