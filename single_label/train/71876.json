{"id":71876,"title":"Promising rationally derived combination therapy with PI3K and CDK4/6 inhibitors.","abstract":"In this issue of Cancer Cell, Vora and colleagues demonstrate that persistent CDK4 and pRB activation underlie acquired resistance to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that clinical evaluation of rational combination therapy with PI3K and CDK4/6 inhibitors to mitigate resistance to PI3K inhibition is warranted.
