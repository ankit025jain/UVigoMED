{"id":45691,"title":"[Expression of miR-146a in colon cancer and its significance].","abstract":"To investigate miR-146a expression in colonic cancer and its clinical implications.Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to detect the levels of miR-146a expression in colonic cancer tissues, pair-matched adjacent normal tissues and different colonic cancer cell lines. MTT essay was used to evaluate the proliferation of colonic cancer SW260 cells transfected with miR-146a mimics, and the cell cycle and apoptosis of the cells were analyzed with flow cytometry.Compared with the normal tissues, 38 of the 43 colonic cancer samples showed down-regulated miR-146a expression, which was associated with poor tumor differentiation. The expression of miR-146a in the tumor tissues was significantly correlated with tumor size and clinical stages. The patients with high miR-146a expression levels had significantly longer total survival time than those with low expression of miR-146a. In SW260 cell cultures, transfection with miR-146a mimics significantly inhibited cell growth (P<0.05) and increased the cell apoptosis rate (11.9% vs 5.9%) but produced no obvious effect on cell cycle.miR-146a may serve as a potential therapeutic target for colonic cancer for its role in inhibiting colonic cancer cell proliferation.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670457","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.736829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.654832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.59798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.273369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.229215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Essay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"}]}
