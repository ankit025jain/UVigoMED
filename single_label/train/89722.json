{"id":89722,"title":"A prospective study to assess the outcomes of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.","abstract":"Continuously increasing numbers of primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions invites a parallel increase in graft failures and need for revision ACL reconstruction surgery. High failure rates has previously stigmatised the revision surgery. We performed this study using multiple outcome measures together with clinical examination to offer a full assessment of the outcomes of this procedure.Twenty patients, with mean age of 29.4 years (17-50 years), were included in this study prior to their revision ACL reconstruction surgery. All patients were followed prospectively collecting the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Tegner-Lysholm scores pre- and post-operatively together with clinical assessment of the antero-posterior knee laxity.After a mean follow up interval of 30 months (16-60 months) significant post-operative improvement of IKDC, Tegner-Lysholm scores and knee antero-posterior laxity together with the Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of Life (QOL) components of the KOOS score was noticed (P < 0.05). However, there was no similar improvement in pain and sports components of the KOOS score (P > 0.05). There was no difference in the outcomes of different graft types.Good outcomes of revision ACL reconstruction surgery are achievable. The use of different graft types did not affect the outcome of the procedure. Most of the patients opted to less aggressive sports participation after the revision procedure.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687269","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.763577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.620321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.409985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.368125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.229839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.0291129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"1750","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1750"},{"name":"1660","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1660"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Comparison of birth control methods","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_birth_control_methods"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Anti-Defamation League","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
