{"id":66140,"title":"The effect of combination therapy with rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin on the progression of chronic antibody mediated rejection in renal transplant recipients.","abstract":"The treatment for chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR) remains controversial. We investigated the efficacy of rituximab (RTX) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) for CAMR. Eighteen patients with CAMR were treated with RTX (375?mg/m(2)) and IVIg (0.4?g/kg) for 4 days. The efficacy of RTX/IVIg combination therapy (RIT) was assessed by decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate per month (?eGFR) before and after RIT. Patients were divided into responder and nonresponder groups based on decrease and no decrease in ?eGFR, respectively, and their clinical and histological characteristics were compared. Response rate to RIT was 66.7% (12/18), and overall ?eGFR decreased significantly to 0.4 ± 1.7?mL·min(-1) ·1.73?m(-2) per month 6 months after RIT compared to that observed 6 months before RIT (1.8 ± 1.0, P < 0.05). Clinical and histological features between the 12 responders and the 6 nonresponders were not significantly different, but nonresponders had a significantly higher proteinuria levels at the time of RIT (2.5 ± 2.5 versus 7.0 ± 3.5 protein/creatinine (g/g), P < 0.001). The effect of the RIT on ?eGFR had dissipated in all patients by 1 year post-RIT. Thus, RIT delayed CAMR progression, and baseline proteinuria level was a prognostic factor for response to RIT.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741626","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.628986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.50711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"}]}
