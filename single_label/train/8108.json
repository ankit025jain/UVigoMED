{"id":8108,"title":"Mechanisms involved in spinal cord central synapse loss in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy.","abstract":"Motoneuron (MN) cell death is the histopathologic hallmark of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), although MN loss seems to be a late event. Conversely, disruption of afferent synapses on MNs has been shown to occur early in SMA. Using a mouse model of severe SMA (SMN?7), we examined the mechanisms involved in impairment of central synapses. We found that MNs underwent progressive degeneration in the course of SMA, with MN loss still occurring at late stages. Loss of afferent inputs to SMA MNs was detected at embryonic stages, long before MN death. Reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis were present in the spinal cord of diseased animals after the onset of MN loss. Ultrastructural observations indicate that dendrites and microglia phagocytose adjacent degenerating presynaptic terminals. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase was upregulated in SMN?7 MNs, and there was an increase in phosphorylated myosin light chain expression in synaptic afferents on MNs; these observations implicate nitric oxide in MN deafferentation and suggest that the RhoA/ROCK pathway is activated. Together, our observations suggest that the earliest change occurring in SMN?7 mice is the loss of excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs to MNs; reduced excitability may enhance their vulnerability to degeneration and death.
