{"id":16227,"title":"Helicobacter pylori infection in children in Madagascar: risk factors for acquisition.","abstract":"The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence, risk factors for acquisition and the clinical characteristics of H. pylori infection in Malagasy children.A 2 year prospective study was conducted among 434 children from a rural (group A) and an urban area (group B). H. pylori status was evaluated by an ELISA serological test. Various demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded and subjected to statistical analysis.The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 39.6% and increased significantly from 18.1% for children <1 year old to 61.5% for children >10 years old. It was significantly higher in group B (46.9%) than in group A (26.4%). Using multivariate logistic regression modelling, a significant association was found between H. pylori infection and drinking spring water. Exposure to antibiotics during the previous year had no observable effect on H. pylori.The overall prevalence of H. pylori infection among Malagasy children was 39.6%. A significant association between H. pylori infection and drinking spring water was found.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046887","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.760458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.62352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.357338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.307444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.238822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.238326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Madagascar","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Spring (hydrosphere)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"A and an","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_and_an"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_2"},{"name":"A26 autoroute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A26_autoroute"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
