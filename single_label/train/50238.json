{"id":50238,"title":"Glycoprotein 130 receptor signaling mediates ?-cell dysfunction in a rodent model of type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Dysregulated glucagon secretion accompanies islet inflammation in type 2 diabetes. We recently discovered that interleukin (IL)-6 stimulates glucagon secretion from human and rodent islets. IL-6 family cytokines require the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) receptor to signal. In this study, we elucidated the effects of ?-cell gp130 receptor signaling on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. IL-6 family cytokines were elevated in islets in rodent models of this disease. gp130 receptor activation increased STAT3 phosphorylation in primary ?-cells and stimulated glucagon secretion. Pancreatic ?-cell gp130 knockout (?gp130KO) mice showed no differences in glycemic control, ?-cell function, or ?-cell mass. However, when subjected to streptozotocin plus high-fat diet to induce islet inflammation and pathophysiology modeling type 2 diabetes, ?gp130KO mice had reduced fasting glycemia, improved glucose tolerance, reduced fasting insulin, and improved ?-cell function. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps revealed no differences in insulin sensitivity. We conclude that in a setting of islet inflammation and pathophysiology modeling type 2 diabetes, activation of ?-cell gp130 receptor signaling has deleterious effects on ?-cell function, promoting hyperglycemia. Antagonism of ?-cell gp130 receptor signaling may be useful for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812426","annotations":[{"name":"Glucagon","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.73545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.678518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.625145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.608726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.554904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.460295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.123702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Glycoprotein 130","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein_130"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
