{"id":87882,"title":"PET/CT study of temporal variations in blood flow to the femoral head following low-energy fracture of the femoral neck.","abstract":"Earlier studies on femoral neck fractures have assessed the blood flow in either the pre- or postoperative period and information is lacking regarding changes in vascular flow to the femoral head after injury. Sixty-two adults with low-energy intracapsular femoral neck fractures were studied prospectively. Mean patient age was 57.2 years (range, 45-82 years). All patients underwent positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) prior to surgical intervention and 6 weeks after internal fixation. Internal fixation was done using cannulated cancellous titanium screws and serial follow-up radiographs were obtained (at monthly intervals for the first 3 months followed by 3 monthly intervals between radiographs up to 2 years). On the preoperative PET/CT, 13 patients showed intact vascularity, 31 showed total loss of vascularity, and 18 showed partial loss of vascularity of the femoral head. The 6-week postoperative PET/CT scan showed recovery of blood supply in 23 of the 31 patients with total loss of vascularity and 15 of the 18 patients with partial loss of vascularity of the femoral head. Eleven of 62 patients had total or partial avascularity at the 6-week postoperative PET/CT scan and all 11 patients showed evidence of avascular necrosis on plain radiographs at the end of 2 years. The association between the vascular status of the femoral head at 6 weeks and avascular necrosis at the end of 2 years was statistically significant (P<.001). This study shows that the femoral head undergoes temporal variations in blood flow following femoral neck fracture. Decreased or absent vascularity is seen in approximately 75% of the fractures and 80% of the femoral heads with initial vascular compromise seem to regain blood flow within 6 weeks. Thus, prognostication about vascularity based on single-point preoperative imaging is difficult. The 6-week postoperative PET/CT scan seems to be reliable in predicting the future status of the femoral head. However, decision making regarding hemiarthroplasty or internal fixation at the time of injury may have to depend on factors other than the preoperative vascular status of the femoral head.
