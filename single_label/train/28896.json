{"id":28896,"title":"DSM-IV antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder: evidence for taxonic structures among individuals with and without substance use disorders in the general population.","abstract":"The categorical-dimensional status of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) conduct disorder (CD) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a source of controversy. This study examined whether the underlying structure of DSM-IV CD and ASPD was dimensional or categorical (taxonic) among individuals with and without substance use disorders.Using a national large representative survey of U.S. adults (n = 43,093), taxometric analyses of DSM-IV CD and ASPD diagnostic criteria were conducted on the total sample and among those with and without substance use disorders.Results of three taxometric procedures were consistent in showing that the structures underlying DSM-IV CD and ASPD were clearly taxonic in the total sample and among individuals with and without substance use disorders. Comparison curve fit indices exceeded 0.57 for each model.Taxonic findings of the present study were in contrast to the dimensional results of prior taxometric research among incarcerated samples with substantial comorbidity of antisocial syndromes and substance use disorders. Results supported the categorical representation and diagnostic thresholds of ASPD and CD as defined in DSM-IV and DSM-5. That the structure of ASPD and CD may be taxonic suggests that further research on these disorders use group comparative designs in which samples with and without these disorders are compared in terms of sociodemographic and clinical correlates, comorbidity, and treatment utilization. The taxonic structure of ASPD and CD may contribute to future research on causal processes through which these antisocial syndromes develop.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766762","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"},{"name":"Conduct disorder","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduct_disorder"},{"name":"Antisocial personality disorder","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Personality disorder","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.717209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Incarceration","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.12882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
