{"id":77798,"title":"[The results of the multicenter observational program \"GLOBUS\" on the study of the prevalence of vertigo and treatment schemes in outpatient clinics].","abstract":"To study the prevalence of vertigo and treatment schemes in outpatient clinics.Six hundred and six physicians of different specialties from 59 regions of the Russian Federation participated in the program, 6065 patients with vertigo were enrolled. The program included the first screening visit and 2 visits after 30 and 60 days. Patients received cavinton forte in dose 10 mg 3 times a day. Assessment of complaints and analysis of the changes in physiological parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) were performed.A significant decrease of complains was noted in most cases. The treatment resulted in a significant (p<0,05) reduction of complaints on non-systemic and systemic vertigo, headache, buzzing in the ears, gait disturbance, asthenia, anxiety. The cardiological safety and absence of side-effects have been demonstrated. Cavinton forte cab be recommended for treatment of vertigo and gait instability.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988956","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.757949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.69103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.532881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.339386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.330124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.26907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.174002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.172547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gait abnormality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_abnormality"},{"name":"Vinpocetine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinpocetine"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Russians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians"},{"name":"Dynamics (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Scheme (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Taxicab","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab"}]}
