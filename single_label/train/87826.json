{"id":87826,"title":"Anaesthesia considerations in penetrating trauma.","abstract":"Trauma and penetrating injury, mostly in the form of assault and self-inflicted gunshot and stab wounds, is a major contributor to mortality and morbidity in the modern world, specifically among younger populations. While the prevalence of this form of injury is drastically lower in the UK and Europe in comparison with the USA, it is still common enough to necessitate practising anaesthetists to have a good understanding and working knowledge of the principles in treating victims with penetrating injury. This review article aims to cover basic principles of attending to penetrating trauma victims starting at the pre-hospital level and continuing into the emergency department (ED) and the operating theatre. We will highlight major issues with regard to airway control, severe bleeding treatment, and emergency scene and ED procedures. We also suggest a work flow for treating life-threatening penetrating injury and review the major controversies in this field. Our perspective is based on the experience and procedures used at the University of Washington's Harborview Medical Center, the only level 1 trauma centre covering the states of Washington, Alaska, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming in the USA. This region contains almost 11 000 000 persons over a surface area of more than 2 700 000 km(2).
