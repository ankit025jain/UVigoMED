{"id":77614,"title":"Risk factors for nonwork-related adult-onset asthma and occupational asthma: a comparative review.","abstract":"To identify the similarities and differences between nonwork-related adult-onset and occupational asthma from various literature sources published between 2010 and 2013, with respect to the epidemiology, phenotypic manifestations, and risk factors for the disease.The incidence of adult-onset asthma from pooled population studies is estimated to be 3.6 per 1000 person-years in men and 4.6 cases per 1000 person-years in women. In adults with new-onset asthma, occupational asthma is a common asthma phenotype. Work-related factors are estimated to account for up to 25% of adult cases of asthma and occupational asthma comprising about 16% of adult-onset asthma cases. The review finds that nonwork-related adult-onset asthma is a heterogenous entity and that environmental exposure factors (aside from occupational exposures) appear to have a lesser role than host factors when compared with occupational asthma.Large-scale general population studies are needed to identify the similarities and differences between nonwork-related adult-onset and occupational asthma, which may enable a better understanding of these entities and promote efforts towards holistic management approaches for these asthma phenotypes.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535141","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Holism","weight":0.776284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.636901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.529635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.411544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.244178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.206572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.171192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Occupational asthma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_asthma"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Fisheries management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheries_management"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
