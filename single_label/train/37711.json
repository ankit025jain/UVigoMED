{"id":37711,"title":"Dietary intake, plasma homocysteine, and repetitive element DNA methylation in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).","abstract":"DNA methylation of repetitive elements may explain the relations between dietary intake, hyperhomocysteinemia, and cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated associations of methyl micronutrient intake and plasma total homocysteine with LINE-1 and Alu methylation in a cross-sectional study of 987 adults aged 45-84 y who participated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Stress Study.DNA methylation was estimated using pyrosequencing technology. A 120-item food frequency questionnaire was used to ascertain daily intake of folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, zinc, and methionine. Plasma total homocysteine was quantified using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Associations of micronutrient intake and homocysteine with LINE-1 and Alu methylation were examined using linear regression. Adjusted differences in %5-methylated cytosines (%5 mC) were examined by categories of predictors using multivariable linear regression models. Intake of methyl-donor micronutrients was not associated with DNA methylation. After adjustment for covariates, each 3 ?mol/L increment of homocysteine corresponded with 0.06 (-0.01, 0.13) %5 mC higher LINE-1 methylation. Additionally, BMI was positively associated with LINE-1 methylation (P trend = 0.03). Participants with BMI ? 40 kg/mÂ² had 0.35 (0.03, 0.67) %5 mC higher LINE-1 than those with normal BMI. We also observed a 0.10 (0.02, 0.19) %5 mC difference in Alu methylation per 10 cm of height. These associations did not differ by sex.Dietary intake of methyl-donor micronutrients was not associated with measures of DNA methylation in our sample. However, higher BMI was related to higher LINE-1 methylation, and height was positively associated with Alu methylation.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477006","annotations":[{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.835741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.739164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hyperhomocysteinemia","weight":0.622669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhomocysteinemia"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.45022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"}]}
