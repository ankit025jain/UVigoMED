{"id":68036,"title":"Pathological patterns of primary nephrotic syndrome in Central China: a retrospective study of 627 cases.","abstract":"The pathological patterns underlying PNS in adult are poorly studied in Central China.This is a retrospective analysis of the clinical and pathologic data involving 627 adult patients with PNS who have been finished the renal biopsies from January 2009 to September 2012 in XiangYa 2nd Hospital of Central South University. Patients enrolled in our study were all from Central China.There were 379 males and 248 females, formed the ratio of 1.53:1. There existed three main sorts of pathological patterns underlying PNS: membranous nephropathy (MN) 26.63%, minimal change disease (MCD) 23.60%, IgA nephropathy (IgAN) 23.39%. Among all biopsies, the proportion of FSGS underlying PNS increased from 5.8% during the period from 2009 to 2010 to 14.7% during the period from 2011 to 2012. The most common complication of PNS was infectious diseases, and MCD underlying PNS ran a higher risk of encountering acute renal injury. IgAN had the highest incidence of hematuresis. The common pathological patterns of PNS differed in age-brackets: IgAN and MCD were the main pathological lesions in patients aged from 16 to 30 years; MN mostly occurs in patients over 30. MCD was the dominating pathological lesions underlying IgAN which expressed as PNS.(1) MN was the most frequent pathological pattern underlying PNS, the proportion of FSGS underlying PNS increased during the last 2 years. (2) The common pathological patterns of PNS differed in age-brackets and pathological patterns correlated to the complications or comorbidities of PNS to some extent.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564431","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.793129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.702637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.544953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"China","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Membranous glomerulonephritis","weight":0.359328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membranous_glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.314732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Minimal change disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_change_disease"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"IgA nephropathy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA_nephropathy"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"}]}
