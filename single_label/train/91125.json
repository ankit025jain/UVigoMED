{"id":91125,"title":"Tendon transfers in the treatment of Achilles' tendon disorders.","abstract":"The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the human body and, as such, has its share of problems. Although many conditions affecting this tendon can be treated nonoperatively, surgical intervention is often necessary. Local, regional, distant, and allograft tendon can be used to supplement or enhance reconstruction or repair of the Achilles tendon. Specific techniques are explored and described and the published results from the literature summarized. This article explores the use of tendon transfers and supplementation in the treatment of insertional and noninsertional Achilles tendinosis as well as in cases of neglected or chronic ruptures of the tendoachilles.
