{"id":91197,"title":"Risk factors for severe perineal lacerations during childbirth.","abstract":"Severe perineal lacerations represent a significant complication of normal labor with a strong impact on quality of life.To identify factors that lead to the occurrence of severe perineal lacerations.We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar and reference lists from all included studies.We included prospective and retrospective observational studies.Predetermined data were collected and analyzed with the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects model or the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.The meta-analysis included 22 studies (n=651,934). Women with severe perineal tears were more likely to have had heavier infants (mean difference 192.88 g [95% CI, 139.80-245.96 g]), an episiotomy (OR 3.82 [95% CI, 1.96-7.42]), or an operative vaginal delivery (OR 5.10 [95% CI, 3.33-7.83]). Epidural anesthesia (OR 1.95 [95% CI, 1.63-2.32]), labor induction (OR 1.08 [95% CI, 1.02-1.14]), and labor augmentation (OR 1.95 [95% CI, 1.56-2.44]) were also more common among women with perineal lacerations.Various factors contribute to the occurrence of perineal lacerations. Future studies should consistently evaluate all examined parameters to determine their possible interrelation.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529800","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.663973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.657634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.496147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Episiotomy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"Google Scholar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"ClinicalTrials.gov","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClinicalTrials.gov"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"632","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/632"},{"name":"967","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/967"},{"name":"651","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/651"},{"name":"337","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/337"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"934","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/934"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Scholar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Area code 562","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_562"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
