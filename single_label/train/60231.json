{"id":60231,"title":"Clinicohaematological profile of aplastic anaemia in a rural medical college of Northern West Bengal.","abstract":"There is a scarcity of clinical data in the field of aplastic anaemia from rural India. Present study was conducted in North Bengal Medical College to find out the clinicohaematological profile and the possible aetiological factors in patients with aplastic anaemia. The study population (n = 83) included 21 children with male to female ratio 4.93:1. Weakness was present in all cases and pallor was present in 74.70% cases. Fever, bleeding episodes and localised infection were found in 55.42%, 48.19% and 27.71% cases respectively. There was no difference in clinical manifestations between children and adult except occurrence of fever (p = 0.0365). We identified possible aetiological factors in 32.53% cases as relevant drug intake in 10.84%, exposure to chemicals in 13.25% and hepatitis in 8.43% cases. We found low mean haemoglobin (3.81 +/- 1.71 g/dl), leucocyte and platelet (3.05 +/- 1.3 and 37.30 +/- 35 x 10(3)/cmm), neutrophil (30.28 +/- 21.76%) and high lymphocyte (67.27 +/- 22.50%) in peripheral blood. At the time of presentation, aplastic anaemia was moderate in 59.04% cases, severe in 48.19% cases and mild in 4.82% cases. We estimated the prevalence of aplastic anaemia in 4 districts of West Bengal including tea garden areas was 2.98/million populations per year. It was concluded that aplastic anaemia is a major non-malignant haematological disease in this part of India, and an increasing use of chemicals in agricultural and tea garden areas might be the responsible factor. Larger population based study is suggested.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
