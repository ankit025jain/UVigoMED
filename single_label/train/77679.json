{"id":77679,"title":"[Circadian rhythm sleep disorder].","abstract":"Primary pathophysiology of circadian rhythm sleep disorders(CRSDs) is a misalignment between the endogenous circadian rhythm phase and the desired or socially required sleep-wake schedule, or dysfunction of the circadian pacemaker and its afferent/efferent pathways. CRSDs consist of delayed sleep phase type, advanced sleep phase type, free-running type, irregular sleep-wake type, shift work type and jet lag type. Chronotherapy using strong zeitgebers (time cues), such as bright light and melatonin/ melatonin type 2 receptor agonist, is effective when administered with proper timing. Bright light is the strongest entraining agent of circadian rhythms. Bright light therapy (appropriately-timed exposure to bright light) for CRSDs is an effective treatment option, and can shift the sleep-wake cycle to earlier or later times, in order to correct for misalignment between the circadian system and the desired sleep-wake schedule. Timed administration of melatonin, either alone or in combination with light therapy has also been shown to be useful in the treatment of CRSDs.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437262","annotations":[{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm sleep disorder","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm_sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Jet lag","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_lag"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.695645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.519626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.450489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"},{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.159054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Free-running sleep","weight":0.0574438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-running_sleep"},{"name":"Chronotherapy","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotherapy"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Cue (theatrical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_(theatrical)"},{"name":"Entrainment (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_(engineering)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Lag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Jet aircraft","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft"}]}
