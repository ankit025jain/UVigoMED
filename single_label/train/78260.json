{"id":78260,"title":"Nasal symptoms in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and their impact on therapeutic compliance with continuous positive airway pressure.","abstract":"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first line treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Despite the high effectiveness of this treatment, its use is often limited by suboptimal compliance and/or intolerance. Nasal side effects are considered a major cause of low therapeutic compliance. At present, there are no data to predict which patients will develop CPAP intolerance caused by nasal symptoms and only few studies looked at the effect of treatment of nasal symptoms on CPAP compliance. The first section of this review focuses on the impact of nasal symptoms (pre-existing or as a side effect of CPAP) on CPAP compliance/intolerance. The second section deals with the effect of nasal symptom treatment on CPAP compliance.
