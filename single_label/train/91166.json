{"id":91166,"title":"Validation of GAITRite and PROMIS as high-throughput physical function outcome measures following ACL reconstruction.","abstract":"New healthcare demands for quality measures of elective procedures, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery, warrant the establishment of high throughput outcomes for high volume clinics. To this end, we evaluated the PROMIS and GAITRite as physical function outcome measures to quantify early healing and post-operative complications in 106 patients at pre-operative and 3, 10, 20 and 52 weeks post-ACL reconstruction with bone-tendon-bone autograft, and compared the results to the current IKDC validated outcome measure. The results showed that both PROMIS and GAITRite were significantly quicker to administer versus IKDC (p<0.0001). Additional advantages were that PROMIS and GAITRite detected a significant decrease in physical function at 3 weeks post-operative, and a significant improvement at 10 weeks post-operative versus pre-operative (p<0.001), which were not detected with IKDC. GAITRite was limited by a low ceiling that could not detect improvement of physical function beyond 20 weeks, while both PROMIS and IKDC detected significant improvement out to 52 weeks post-operative (p<0.001). Linear regressions demonstrated a significant relationship between IKDC and PROMIS, with a combined correlation value of 0.8954 (p<0.001) for all time points. Finally, ROC curve analysis demonstrated that PROMIS is a diagnostic test for poor outcomes.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532421","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.692953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.332903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.232652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.178079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Throughput","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Warrant (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)"},{"name":"Ceiling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiling"},{"name":"High-throughput screening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"}]}
