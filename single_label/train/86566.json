{"id":86566,"title":"Expression of ERCC1, MSH2 and PARP1 in non-small cell lung cancer and prognostic value in patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.","abstract":"To evaluate the prognostic value of the expression of excision repair cross-complementation group l (ERCC1), MutS protein homolog 2 (MSH2) and poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) in non-small-cell lung cancer patients receiving platinum-based postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect the expression of ERCC1, MSH2 and PARP1 in 111 cases of non-small cell lung cancer paraffin embedded surgical specimens. Through og-rank survival analysis, we evaluated the prognostic value of the ERCC1, MSH2, PARP1 and the related clinicopathological factors. COX regression analysis was used to determine whether ERCC1, MSH2 and PARP1 were independent prognostic factors.In the enrolled 111 non-small cell lung cancer patients, the positive expression rate of ERCC1, MSH2 and RARP1 was 33.3%, 36.9% and 55.9%, respectively. ERCC1 (P<0.001) and PARP1 (P=0.033) were found to be correlated with the survival time while there was no correlation for MSH2 (P=0.298). Patients with both ERCC1 and PARP1 negative cancer had significantly longer survival time than those with ERCC1 (P=0.042) or PARP1 (P=0.027) positive alone. Similalry, the survival time of patients with both ERCC1 and PARP1 positive cancer was shorter than those with ERCC1 (P=0.048) or PARP1 (P=0.01) positive alone.Patients with ERCC1 or PARP1 negative non-small cell lung cancer appear to benefit from platinum-based postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761869","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.929752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.72332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.685582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.538822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.468172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.321041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.285637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"ERCC1","weight":0.117191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCC1"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Surgical pathology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_pathology"},{"name":"Reverse Address Resolution Protocol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Address_Resolution_Protocol"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"MSH2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSH2"},{"name":"PARP1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARP1"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"298","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/298"},{"name":"Polyphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly"},{"name":"Melanocyte-stimulating hormone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Excision repair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excision_repair"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"}]}
