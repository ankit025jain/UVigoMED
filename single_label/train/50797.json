{"id":50797,"title":"Night eating in patients with type 2 diabetes. Associations with glycemic control, eating patterns, sleep, and mood.","abstract":"Night eating is a complex behavior associated with disruptions in eating, sleep, and mood regulation. While night eating has been associated with alterations in neuroendocrine functioning, night eating and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are not well understood in patients with prevalent metabolic conditions, such as diabetes. In this study, 194 adults with Type 2 diabetes completed questionnaires assessing night eating symptoms as well as eating, sleep, and depressive symptoms. Glycemic control data, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), were gathered from patient medical charts. Results indicated that 7% of participants met criteria for NES. Increased symptoms of night eating were associated with poorer glycemic control and disruptions in eating, sleep, and mood, including significantly increased likelihood of having HbA1c levels >7% and endorsing clinical levels of depressive symptoms. Increasing understanding of the relationship between night eating and metabolic and psychosocial functioning in patients with diabetes may provide new avenues for treatment of these patients.
