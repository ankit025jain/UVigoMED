{"id":83780,"title":"Evaluation of premenstrual syndrome and quality of life in university students.","abstract":"To determine the frequency of premenstrual syndrome, review associated factors and evaluate quality of life in university students.The cross-sectional study was conducted at Sakarya University, Turkey, between October 25, 2012, and April 25, 2013. Premenstrual Syndrome Scale was used based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III and IV (revised) for the evaluation of premenstrual syndrome. Short Form-36 was used to evaluate quality of life. Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyse the data.The median age of the 1008 students in the study was 21 (range: 17-25). Frequency of premenstrual syndrome was found to be lower in overweight/obese students (p < 0.05). Average scores of students with PMS were lower in all domains of quality of life (p < 0.05 for each domain).As an important health problem among university students, premenstrual syndrome adversely affects quality of life.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252518","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.589692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.450189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","weight":0.0813771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Premenstrual syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_syndrome"},{"name":"Sakarya University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakarya_University"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"April 25","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_25"},{"name":"October 25","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_25"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"1725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1725"},{"name":"1008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1008"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Sakarya Province","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakarya_Province"}]}
