{"id":62508,"title":"Hepatic cysts treated with percutaneous ethanol sclerotherapy: time to extend the indications to haemorrhagic cysts and polycystic liver disease.","abstract":"To describe the long-term clinical and morphological outcome of symptomatic hepatic cysts treated with percutaneous ethanol sclerotherapy (PES).From December 2003 to September 2011, all patients with hepatic cysts undergoing PES with a follow-up after 12 months were included. Evolution of the volume of the cysts and clinical and biological data were recorded. Features of the cyst were evaluated in each patient: simple, haemorrhagic or developed on underlying polycystic liver disease (PCLD).Fifty-eight cysts (median volume 666 mL) were treated in 57 patients (52 women, mean age 58 years (18-80)). Twenty-two patients (39 %) had simple hepatic cysts, 19 (33 %) had dominant cysts on PCLD and 20 had haemorrhagic cysts (34.5 %), including 4 with PCLD. After a mean 27.3 months of follow-up, the final median cystic volume was 13.5 mL (p?<?0.0001), and the median reduction in cyst volume was 94 % (58-100 %). Treatment was satisfactory in 95 % of the patients (54/57) (symptoms disappeared in 45/57 (79 %), decreased in 9/57 (16 %)). There was no clinical or morphological difference between patients with PCLD, haemorrhagic cysts or simple cysts.The clinical and morphological efficacy of a single session of PES is very high, regardless of the presence of intracystic haemorrhage or underlying PCLD.• The clinical efficacy of percutaneous ethanol sclerotherapy is very high. • Haemorrhagic content should not be a contraindication for percutaneous sclerotherapy. • Dominant cysts on polycystic liver disease should be treated with PES. • Imaging follow-up should not be performed shortly after the procedure.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563160","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.758968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.705147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.606021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.554434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.375104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.243798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.23351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.221947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.19474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Polycystic liver disease","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"1880","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1880"},{"name":"957","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/957"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Party of European Socialists","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_European_Socialists"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Biological data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_data"}]}
