{"id":21592,"title":"Nickel free-diet enhances the Helicobacter pylori eradication rate: a pilot study.","abstract":"The Helicobacter pylori eradication rate with standard triple therapy is very low. H. pylori is known to require the nickel-containing metalloenzymes urease and NiFe-hydrogenase to survive at the low pH environment in the stomach.To compare the H. pylori eradication rate of a nickel free-diet associated with standard triple therapy and standard triple therapy alone as the first-line regimen.Fifty-two sex- and age-matched patients at the first diagnosis of H. pylori infection were randomized 1:1 into two different therapeutic schemes: (1) standard LCA (26 patients): lansoprazole 15 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid and amoxicillin 1,000 mg bid for 7 days with a common diet; (2) standard LCA plus a nickel free-diet (NFD-LCA) (26 patients). Patients followed 30 days of a nickel-free diet plus a week of lansoprazole 15 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid and amoxicillin 1,000 mg bid starting from day 15 of the diet.All patients completed the study. A significantly higher eradication rate was observed in the NFD-LCA group (22/26) versus LCA group (12/26) (p < 0.01). Only a few patients (9 of 52) reported the occurrence of mild therapy-related side effects, without any significant differences between the two groups.The addition of a nickel-free diet to standard triple therapy significantly increases the H. pylori eradication rate. The reduction of H. pylori urease activity due to the nickel-free diet could expose the bacterium to gastric acid and increase H. pylori's susceptibility to amoxicillin. Further studies are necessary to confirm this preliminary result.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595654","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Clarithromycin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarithromycin"},{"name":"Gastric acid","weight":0.859022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.520478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Nickel","weight":0.492733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.426823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Lansoprazole","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansoprazole"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.268146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metalloprotein","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloprotein"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Pest control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_control"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"}]}
