{"id":23267,"title":"[Outbreak with Ralstonia pickettii caused by contaminated magnesium vials].","abstract":"In February 2013, 5 patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) were found to have positive blood cultures with Ralstonia pickettii within one week. Because all patients got intravenous therapy, improper work of a staff member was suspected. Some days later, a 6th patient was found with a positive blood culture of Ralstonia pickettii in another department of the hospital.Hygienic investigations showed no evidence of failures in preparation of intravenous therapy. All patients were on different intravenous drugs, but every patient had received glucose 5?% and magnesium. We examined samples of glucose and magnesia as well as samples from environment. RESULTS AND COURSE: Glucose and magnesium samples were examined by membrane filter method. Ralstonia pitteckii was detected in some Magnesium vials. We concluded, that contamination of Magnesium vials might have been the reason for blood stream infection of patients. Pharmacists and authorities were informed and all vials were collected and replaced by vials from another company. Later a nationwide recall of Magnesium vials was performed by the producing company. No further Ralstonia pickettii was found in blood cultures in our hospital.Unusual pathogens in blood cultures should lead to reflection of rarer causes such as contamination of medicines.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496893","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.836512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.762222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.719693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.673986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.573664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.541068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.441259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.400789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.331648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Microfiltration","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfiltration"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Magnesium oxide","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_oxide"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Vial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vial"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
