{"id":68077,"title":"[Guidelines concerning urinary incontinence in elderly: construction and validation of GRAPPPA algorithm].","abstract":"Provide guidelines presented as an algorithm for practical evaluation and first line therapy of urinary incontinence in elderly.Guidelines using formalized consensus guidelines method. These guidelines have been validated by a group of 40 experts quoting proposals, subsequently reviewed by an independent group of multidisciplinary experts (urologist, general practitioner, neurologist, gynecologist, geriatrist, specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation).By means of 3 rounds of interrogation of the expert panel, GRAPPPA algorithm was constructed. This algorithm take in account both evaluation and first line therapeutic options in the different type of incontinences observed in this population (urge, stress and mixed incontinence). Initial evaluation consists to track down urinary retention (and subsequently fecal stool impaction, use of anticholinergic or morphinic drugs), urinary tract infection and cognitive impairment. Haematuria, bladder-pelvic pain, history of radiotherapy or recent pelvic surgery, lead to refer the patient to a specialized unit. First line therapy is in all the cases pelvic floor training, use of local oestrogenotherapy and dietetic measures. In urge incontinence, anticholinergic drugs may be used.Implementation of this algorithm may promote best practice in management of urinary incontinence in elderly.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital
