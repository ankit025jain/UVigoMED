{"id":61730,"title":"Fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics (FICTION) detects BCL6 abnormalities, including gene amplification, in most cases of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"BCL6 translocations are a frequent finding in B-cell lymphomas of diverse subtypes, including some cases of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). However, reliable analysis of BCL6 rearrangements using fluorescence in situ hybridization is difficult in NLPHL because of the relative paucity of neoplastic cells. Combined immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization, or fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics as a tool for the investigation of neoplasms (FICTION), permits targeted analysis of neoplastic cells.To better define the spectrum of BCL6 abnormalities in NLPHL using FICTION analysis.We performed an optimized FICTION analysis of 24 lymph nodes, including 11 NLPHL, 5 follicular hyperplasia with prominent progressive transformation of germinal centers, and 8 follicular hyperplasia without progressive transformation of germinal centers.BCL6 rearrangement was identified in 5 of 11 cases of NLPHL (46%). In addition, BCL6 gene amplification, with large clusters of BCL6 signals in the absence of chromosome 3 aneuploidy, was detected in 3 of 11 cases of NLPHL (27%). One NLPHL showed extra copies of BCL6 present in conjunction with multiple copies of chromosome 3. Altogether, we detected BCL6 abnormalities in 9 of 11 cases of NLPHL (82%). None of the progressive transformation of germinal centers or follicular hyperplasia cases showed BCL6 abnormalities by FICTION.To our knowledge, this is the first report of BCL6 gene amplification in NLPHL. Our optimized protocol for FICTION permits detection of cytogenetic abnormalities in most NLPHL cases and may represent a useful ancillary diagnostic technique.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678684","annotations":[{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Immunophenotyping","weight":0.861037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunophenotyping"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.831559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Interphase","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphase"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.651422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.648511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Chromosome 3 (human)","weight":0.647143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_3_(human)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.568532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.540761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.531197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.37494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.294467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Germinal center","weight":0.270796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinal_center"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
