{"id":62660,"title":"Characteristics of endobronchial primitive tumors in children.","abstract":"Primary endobronchial tumors are rare in children and they include a broad spectrum of lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristic features, treatments and outcomes of these tumors. We report a retrospective analysis of all patients treated for endobronchial tumor in nine French hospitals between 1990 and 2010 and a comparison of the results with those reported in the medical literature. Twelve tumors were reported: five low grade muco epidermoid carcinomas, two inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, two hemangiomas, one anaplastic large cell lymphoma, one carcinoid tumor, and one juvenile xanthogranuloma. The mean age of the patients was 7.5?Â±?3.5 years. The most common sign revealing the disease was persistent atelectasis or recurrent pneumonia (eight cases). The other revealing signs were a persistent bronchospasm (three cases) and hemoptysis (one case). The clinical presentation, biology, serum tumor markers, and chest X-ray abnormalities were not specific to a particular histological diagnosis. Chest CT scan revealed the presence of an endobronchial tumor in 11 cases. Nine tumors could be diagnosed from a biopsy obtained by video endoscopy. Complete surgical resection was performed in seven patients. Bronchoscopic removal was performed in five cases and was successful in three. There were no deaths. Endobronchial tumors are rare in childhood and their histology is diverse. Chest CT scan and per-endoscopic endobronchial biopsies are required for diagnosis, when possible. Surgical or endoscopic treatment should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team. Despite the multiple etiologies, the prognosis of these tumors is good if diagnosis is early and if resection is complete. Long-term recurrences have been described, so long-term follow-up of these children is recommended.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
