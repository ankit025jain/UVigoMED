{"id":54615,"title":"Effect of anterior corneal surface asphericity modification on fourth-order zernike spherical aberrations.","abstract":"To evaluate the theoretical influence of the change in corneal asphericity (?Q) on the change in fourth-order Zernike spherical aberration coefficient (?C(4)0) with customized aspheric refractive correction of myopia and hyperopia.The initial anterior corneal surface profile was modeled as a conic section of apical radius of curvature R0 and asphericity Q?. The postoperative corneal profile was modeled as a conic section of apical curvature R1 and asphericity Q1, where R1 was computed from defocus D, and Q? selected for controlling the postoperative asphericity. The corresponding change in fourth-order spherical aberration (?C(0)4) was computed within a 6-mm optical zone using inner products applied to the incurred optical path changes. These calculations were repeated for different values of D, R?, Q?, and various intended ?C(4)0 values.Increasing negative spherical aberration (?C(4)(0) < 0) requires a change toward more negative values of asphericity (increased prolateness; ?Q < 0) for hyperopic and low myopic corrections, but more positive values (?Q < 0) for high myopic correction. The larger the intended change in corneal spherical aberration (?C(4)(0)), the more myopic the threshold value for which the required change in asphericity, ?Q, becomes positive. The influence of the magnitude of paraxial defocus correction is less pronounced when larger changes in C(4)(0) are intended.These results provide a basis for controlling the direction (sign) and the magnitude of spherical aberration changes when using customized aspheric profiles of ablation.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291755","annotations":[{"name":"Conic section","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section"},{"name":"Hyperopia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia"},{"name":"Spherical aberration","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.842079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Radius of curvature (optics)","weight":0.797146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_curvature_(optics)"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.712152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Paraxial approximation","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraxial_approximation"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Aspheric lens","weight":0.644328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspheric_lens"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.339412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Defocus aberration","weight":0.299983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defocus_aberration"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Frits Zernike","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frits_Zernike"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Gyration tensor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyration_tensor"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Dot product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product"},{"name":"Mod (video gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Optical path","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_path"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Theoretical physics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"C4","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Corrections","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections"},{"name":"Hexagonal crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_crystal_system"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
