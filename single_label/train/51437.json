{"id":51437,"title":"Living with diabetes: a group-based self-management support programme for T2DM patients in the early phases of illness and their partners, study protocol of a randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"The present article presents the protocol for a randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a group-based self-management support programme for recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (one to three years post-diagnosis) and their partners. The course aims to support T2DM patients and their partners in successfully integrating diabetes care into their daily lives and hereby enhance self-management and diabetes-specific health-related quality of life. The content of the course is based on the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM). Furthermore, principles from the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and social support theories are integrated.We aim to recruit 160 recently diagnosed T2DM patients and their partners from general practices in six different regions in the Netherlands. Patients need to be diagnosed with T2DM for one to three years and have to experience some degree of diabetes-related difficulties, as measured with a three-item screener. Participating patients and their partners are randomly allocated to the intervention or control condition. Participants in the intervention condition receive three monthly group sessions and a booster session three months later. Participants in the control condition receive a single information meeting. Data will be collected at baseline (T0), directly after the programme (T1) and six months post-programme (T2), including: self-management, diabetes-specific health-related quality of life, illness perceptions, attitudes, social support and empowerment. A three-level multilevel model will be used to compare change-scores between the conditions (intervention/control) on each outcome.Our study will be the first to determine whether a group-based support programme based on the CSM is effective in enhancing self-management and diabetes-specific health-related quality of life in recently diagnosed T2DM patients. The important role of patients' partners in effective diabetes care is also acknowledged in the study.Netherlands National Trial Register (NTR) NTR3302.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690511","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.801965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.700953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.598665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.597669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.351152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Social cognitive theory","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognitive_theory"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.30719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Social cognition","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition"},{"name":"Empowerment","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Multilevel model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Treaty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Kolmogorov space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_space"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Screener","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screener"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Netherlands national football team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
