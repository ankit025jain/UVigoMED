{"id":82115,"title":"Dental and skeletal components of Class II open bite treatment with a modified Thurow appliance.","abstract":"Due to the lack of studies that distinguish between dentoalveolar and basal changes caused by the Thurow appliance, this clinical study, carried out by the School of Dentistry--State University of SÃ£o Paulo/Araraquara, aimed at assessing the dental and skeletal changes induced by modified Thurow appliance.The sample included an experimental group comprising 13 subjects aged between 7 and 10 years old, with Class II malocclusion and anterior open bite, and a control group comprising 22 subjects similar in age, sex and mandibular plane angle. Maxillary/mandibular, horizontal/vertical, dental/skeletal movements (ANS, PNS, U1, U6, Co, Go, Pog, L1, L6) were assessed, based on 14 landmarks, 8 angles (S-N-ANS, SNA, PPA, S-N-Pog, SNB, MPA, PP/MPA, ANB) and 3 linear measures (N-Me, ANS-Me, S-Go).Treatment caused significantly greater angle decrease between the palatal and the mandibular plane on the experimental group, primarily due to an increase in the palatal plane angle. ANB, SNA and S-N-ANS angles significantly decreased more in patients from the experimental group. PNS was superiorly remodeled. Lower face height (ANS-Me) decreased in the experimental group and increased in the control group.The modified Thurow appliance controlled vertical and horizontal displacements of the maxilla, rotated the maxilla and improved open bite malocclusion, decreasing lower facial height.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713556","annotations":[{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.67719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.656307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.633844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.357527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.220199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0919796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0825297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0682928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Open bite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_bite"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Go (game)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"TV Asahi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Asahi"},{"name":"Rattlesnake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattlesnake"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Pogs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogs"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"U1 spliceosomal RNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U1_spliceosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Beechcraft Model 18","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_Model_18"},{"name":"Landmark","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark"},{"name":"IBM Systems Network Architecture","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Systems_Network_Architecture"},{"name":"U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U6_(Berlin_U-Bahn)"},{"name":"Barcelona Metro line 6","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_6"}]}
