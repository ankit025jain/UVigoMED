{"id":50187,"title":"Elevated intraocular pressure in patients with acromegaly.","abstract":"To evaluate central corneal thickness (CCT) and intraocular pressure (IOP) in a cohort of acromegalic patients, and to correlate CCT with serum levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).Consecutive patients affected by acromegaly underwent a comprehensive endocrinological and ophthalmological evaluation, including serum GH and IGF-1 levels, CCT measured with ultrasonic pachymetry and IOP assessed with Goldmann applanation tonometry.Fourteen patients with acromegaly and 28 healthy controls were included in the study. Acromegalic patients had a statistically higher median CCT (570 ?m [range 551.5-638] vs 542.7 ?m [range 461.5-610]; p?<?0.01) and higher median IOP (17.2 mm Hg [range 14-21] vs 13.7 mm Hg [range 10.5-19]; p?<?0.01) than healthy controls. No statistically significant correlation was found among CCT and GH, CCT and IGF-1, IOP and GH, IOP and IGF-1 in the acromegalic group, whereas a statistically significant correlation was documented between CCT and IOP in the entire cohort (Spearman's correlation coefficient: 0.56, p?<?0.01). However, when IOP was corrected for CCT no significant difference was found between the two study groups (p?=?0.07).Our results suggest that acromegaly is associated with an increased CCT, which could lead to an overestimation of IOP readings as determined with Goldmann applanation tonometry.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817254","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.725683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Acromegaly","weight":0.703668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.54628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.293063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tonometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonometry"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"1421","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1421"},{"name":"570","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/570"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Goldmann (publisher)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldmann_(publisher)"},{"name":"Corneal pachymetry","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_pachymetry"}]}
