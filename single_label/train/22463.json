{"id":22463,"title":"Necrotizing fasciitis secondary to bevacizumab treatment for metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.","abstract":"Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor and it is used in metastatic colorectal patients. We present here a case of fatal necrotizing fasciitis in a patient during bevacizumab treatment for colorectal cancer. In our review of the literature, necrotizing fasciitis was not reported before or during bevacizumab treatment.
