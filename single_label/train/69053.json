{"id":69053,"title":"Identification of tissue microRNAs predictive of sunitinib activity in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"To identify tissue microRNAs predictive of sunitinib activity in patients with metastatic renal-cell-carcinoma (MRCC) and to evaluate in vitro their mechanism of action in sunitinib resistance.We screened 673 microRNAs using TaqMan Low-density-Arrays (TLDAs) in tumors from MRCC patients with extreme phenotypes of marked efficacy and resistance to sunitinib, selected from an identification cohort (n = 41). The most relevant differentially expressed microRNAs were selected using bioinformatics-based target prediction analysis and quantified by qRT-PCR in tumors from patients presenting similar phenotypes selected from an independent cohort (n = 101). In vitro experiments were conducted to study the role of miR-942 in sunitinib resistance.TLDAs identified 64 microRNAs differentially expressed in the identification cohort. Seven candidates were quantified by qRT-PCR in the independent series. MiR-942 was the most accurate predictor of sunitinib efficacy (p = 0.0074). High expression of miR-942, miR-628-5p, miR-133a, and miR-484 was significantly associated with decreased time to progression and overall survival. These microRNAs were also overexpressed in the sunitinib resistant cell line Caki-2 in comparison with the sensitive cell line. MiR-942 overexpression in Caki-2 up-regulates MMP-9 and VEGF secretion which, in turn, promote HBMEC endothelial migration and sunitinib resistance.We identified differentially expressed microRNAs in MRCC patients presenting marked sensitivity or resistance to sunitinib. MiR-942 was the best predictor of efficacy. We describe a novel paracrine mechanism through which high miR-942 levels in MRCC cells up-regulates MMP-9 and VEGF secretion to enhance endothelial migration and sunitinib resistance. Our results support further validation of these miRNA in clinical confirmatory studies.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475095","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.849819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.845535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.700638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.6891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.676473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.65789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Paracrine signalling","weight":0.624831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracrine_signalling"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.515061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.500029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.418952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Sunitinib","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunitinib"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.167804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0340852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
