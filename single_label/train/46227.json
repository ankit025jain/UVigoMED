{"id":46227,"title":"Motivating underserved Vietnamese Americans to obtain colorectal cancer screening: evaluation of a culturally tailored DVD intervention.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death among Vietnamese Americans, yet screening remains underutilized. We investigated the effectiveness of a culturally tailored DVD intervention in promoting CRC screening among unscreened Vietnamese Americans age 50 and over.Using a community-based participatory research approach, we conducted a trial comparing twenty-eight subjects who received a mailed DVD in Vietnamese, with twenty-eight subjects who received a mailed brochure in Vietnamese. Subjects completed telephone surveys at baseline, One-month, and one-year. The primary outcome was receipt of screening. Secondary measures were participants' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about CRC screening. Two focus groups explored the intervention's acceptability and effectiveness.At one year, CRC screening rates of 57.1% and 42.9% were observed in experimental and control group respectively (p=0.42), Subjects in both groups showed increased knowledge about CRC after one month. Focus group findings revealed that the DVD was an effective method of communicating information and would help promote screening.The findings suggest that culturally tailored, linguistically appropriate content is more important than the type of media used. This relatively low intensity, low cost intervention utilizing a DVD can be another useful method for outreach to the often hard-to-reach unscreened population.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641410","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.590777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.50524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.321325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"DVD","weight":0.320616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.282524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Linguistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.230914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Participation (decision making)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_(decision_making)"},{"name":"Vietnam","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Data type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type"},{"name":"Low intensity conflict","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_intensity_conflict"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Vietnamese American","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_American"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Organization development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_development"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"},{"name":"Brochure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brochure"},{"name":"Participatory action research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_action_research"},{"name":"Outreach","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outreach"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
