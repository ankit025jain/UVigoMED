{"id":37222,"title":"Peroxisomes: a nexus for lipid metabolism and cellular signaling.","abstract":"Peroxisomes are often dismissed as the cellular hoi polloi, relegated to cleaning up reactive oxygen chemical debris discarded by other organelles. However, their functions extend far beyond hydrogen peroxide metabolism. Peroxisomes are intimately associated with lipid droplets and mitochondria, and their ability to carry out fatty acid oxidation and lipid synthesis, especially the production of ether lipids, may be critical for generating cellular signals required for normal physiology. Here, we review the biology of peroxisomes and their potential relevance to human disorders including cancer, obesity-related diabetes, and degenerative neurologic disease.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508507","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.813417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Ether","weight":0.800688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Organelle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.669155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.6665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.282159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Fatty acid metabolism","weight":0.210309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_metabolism"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.0506369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Gap junction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
