{"id":81429,"title":"Periodontal disease in general practice--an update on the essentials.","abstract":"Periodontal disease has a wide spectrum of presentation, any of which can have an effect on the patient's dental well-being and overall quality of life. This sporadic but sometimes rapidly progressing condition can easily be missed in a busy general practice setting. It is essential that the correct diagnosis is made and our duty of care to the patient fulfilled. If the condition, along with the treatment options and appropriate advice, is not explained to the patient, the individual may well feel that he/she has been let down by the professional person trusted over many years. Clinical Relevance: This article discusses the screening and referral of periodontal patients, taking into account the medico-legal challenges that are currently faced by general dental practitioners (GDPs).","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073230","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.285295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.122478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Duty of care","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Medical law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_law"}]}
