{"id":84137,"title":"The microtubule-associated protein EB1 links AIM2 inflammasomes with autophagy-dependent secretion.","abstract":"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that regulate chronic inflammation-associated diseases by inducing interleukin-1 ? (IL-1?) secretion. Numerous components involved in inflammasome activation have been identified, but the mechanisms of inflammasome-mediated IL-1? secretion have not yet been fully explored. Here, we demonstrate that end-binding protein 1 (EB1), which is required for activation of AIM2 inflammasome complex, links the AIM2 inflammasome to autophagy-dependent secretion. Imaging studies revealed that AIM2 inflammasomes colocalize with microtubule organizing centers and autophagosomes. Biochemical analyses showed that poly(dA-dT)-activated AIM2 inflammasomes induce autophagy and IL-1? secretion in an LC3-dependent fashion. Furthermore, depletion of EB1 decreases autophagic shedding and intracellular trafficking. Finally, we found that the 5'-AMP activated protein kinase may regulate this EB1-mediated autophagy-based inflammasome-induced secretion of IL-1?. These findings reveal a novel EB1-mediated pathway for the secretion of IL-1?.
