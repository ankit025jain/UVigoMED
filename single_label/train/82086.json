{"id":82086,"title":"Calcium enriched mixture cement for primary molars exhibiting root perforations and extensive root resorption: report of three cases.","abstract":"In primary molars with root perforations of endodontic origin, tooth extraction and space maintainer are recommended. Calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) cement is a new biomaterial demonstrating favorable sealability/biocompatibility. This report presents a novel treatment modality for cases of primary molar teeth with root perforations associated with a periodontal lesion due to extensive inflammatory root resorption, whereby CEM was used as a perforation repair/pulpotomy biomaterial. Three cases of primary molar root perforations due to inflammatory resorption were selected; all cases were associated with furcal lesions of endodontic origin. Pulp chambers were accessed/irrigated with NaOCl; the root canal orifices were filled with CEM and restored with stainless steel crowns. Clinical/radiographic examinations up to 17 months revealed that all teeth were functional and free of signs/symptoms of infection and all had complete bone healing. Further trials are suggested to confirm CEM use for management of root perforations in primary molars exhibiting root perforation.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717704","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.768517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Stainless steel","weight":0.701504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.618146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.552922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.547315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Endodontics","weight":0.38729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics"},{"name":"Biomaterial","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomaterial"},{"name":"Sodium hypochlorite","weight":0.203316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite"},{"name":"Root resorption","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_resorption"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Steel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Computational electromagnetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_electromagnetics"},{"name":"Software maintainer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintainer"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Pulp (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(band)"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Bicameralism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"},{"name":"Body orifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_orifice"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
