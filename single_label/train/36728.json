{"id":36728,"title":"Frequency of the transthyretin Val30Met mutation in the northern Swedish population.","abstract":"By genotyping a large number of samples from the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study cohort, a carrier frequency could be determined for the Skellefte책 and Lycksele populations. A previous study of the amyloidogenic transthyretin mutation TTRV30M in Northern Sweden's endemic area has shown a large variation in carrier frequency and penetrance of the trait within the area. However, the estimations have been based on a small sample size within the different regions in the area and therefore, the wide variation in TTRV30M carrier frequency observed between the Lycksele and Skellefte책 populations are uncertain. Based on a total of 3460 samples, the estimated overall carrier frequency in the two regions was 1.82% with a carrier frequency in the Skellefte책 and Lycksele population of 1.63% and 2.02%, respectively. Thus, the previously reported extremely high frequency in the Lycksele region compared to that of the Skellefte책 region could not be substantiated. However, it does not change the previous finding of a surprisingly higher carrier frequency in the population from endemic area of Northern Sweden compared to that reported from endemic areas in Portugal.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555660","annotations":[{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.580555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.534964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Penetrance","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Extremely high frequency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency"},{"name":"Transthyretin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin"},{"name":"Lycksele","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycksele"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Aircraft carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Valine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valine"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Norrland","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norrland"}]}
