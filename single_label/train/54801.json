{"id":54801,"title":"Genome-wide homozygosity mapping in families with leber congenital amaurosis identifies mutations in AIPL1 and RDH12 genes.","abstract":"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) causes severe visual impairment and blindness very early in life. Mutant alleles of several genes acting in different pathways, of which all have critical roles for normal retinal function, were involved in LCA development. The purpose of this study was to use genome-wide genotyping to identify LCA-causing loci in two Turkish families. Genome-wide genotyping and haplotype analysis were performed for prioritization of candidate genes for mutation screening in families with LCA. Identified informative critical choromosomal regions obtained by homozygosity mapping from the families were searched for overlapping of any LCA causative genes. Corresponding clinical phenotypes of the patients with identified mutations were evaluated. In this study, two families were shown to be linked to two different LCA loci covering retinol dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12) and aryl-hydrocarbon-interacting protein-like1 (AIPL1) genes. Mutation screening revealed a novel p.Gln141* mutation in the AIPL1 gene and a previously described p.Thr49Met mutation in the RDH12 gene in a homozygous state. Our patients with the RDH12 mutation had the distinct macular coloboma sign, and the patient with the AIPL1 mutation developed microphthalmia and severe widespread retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, in contrast to previously reported cases. It is currently evident that mutation screening needs to be done in at least 18 genes known to be associated with LCA. Thus, homozygosity mapping is an alternative technique to improve the molecular diagnosis in LCA, which is a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous diseases causing retinal degeneration. The patients without mutation in known genes may further be analyzed by using next-generation sequencing.
