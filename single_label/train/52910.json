{"id":52910,"title":"Outcomes of pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic malignancy in octogenarians: an American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program analysis.","abstract":"Most series analyzing outcomes of pancreaticoduodenectomy in octogenarians are limited by a small sample size. The investigators used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for an analysis of the impact of advanced age on outcomes after pancreatic cancer surgery.The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2005 to 2010 was accessed to study the outcomes of 475 pancreaticoduodenectomies performed in patients ?80 years of age compared with 4,102 patients <80 years of age using chi-square and Student's t tests. A multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with 30-day mortality and the occurrence of major complications.Octogenarians had significantly more preoperative comorbidities compared with patients <80 years of age. On multivariate analysis, age ?80 years was associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing 30-day mortality and major complications compared with patients <80 years of age. On subgroup analysis, septuagenarians had a similar odds ratio of experiencing mortality or complications compared with octogenarians, whereas patients <70 years of age were at lower risk.Although octogenarians have an increased risk for mortality and major complications compared with patients <80 years of age, on subgroup analysis, they do not differ from septuagenarians.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560585","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.812764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.53263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.393516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.277041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.227267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.219609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.211657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"American College of Surgeons","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Surgeons"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Program analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis"},{"name":"Royal College of Surgeons of England","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England"},{"name":"Quality management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"The National (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(band)"}]}
