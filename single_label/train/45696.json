{"id":45696,"title":"Risk analysis for the surgical treatment of colorectal cancer in elderly patients undergoing scheduled and urgent interventions.","abstract":"Due to recorded growth both in living standards and latest researches in medicine, proportion of people in old age has significantly improved all over the world. Although old age people are several percent of the entire society, number of surgeries within the group does not exceed 40%. Also risk of malignant neoplasms among old age people, significantly grows. Malignant neoplasm of colon appears to be most visible problem in group of people in age over 75 years old. The aim of the study was a retrospective analysis of results in treatment of the sick over 75 years old, suffering from Malignant neoplasm of colon. Therapy was performed in the I Unit of General Surgery and Surgical Oncology in Provinical Hospital in Jelenia GÃ³ra.Subject to analysis were 63 patients that went under operations in years from 2006 to 2010 due to the colorectal cancer, who have been divided now into two groups. First group included 49 patients treated as per schedule, and the second stood for 14, who required urgent treatment. Reference group has involved 20 younger patients, treated in urgent and scheduled courses, due to the colon cancer. There are no contradictions to emergencies and scheduled surgeries for patients in advanced years, suffering from colon cancer. Complications after colon cancer emergencies are far more frequent than in case of scheduled surgeries. Death rates among patients over 75 years old are far more frequent after emergencies than after scheduled surgeries. Concomitant diseases occur the same frequent during emergenices as during scheduled operations. During emergencies, it was left side of the colon that occured to be infected with cancer more frequent.There is no significant diversity in hospitalization time frames after emergencies and scheduled surgeries. Dangerous surgical complications within group of older patients, those after emergencies and scheduled surgeries too, are far more frequent in comparison to the reference group.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670335","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"General surgery","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_surgery"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.380612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.370794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.196588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Standard of living","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.0229109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Natural satellite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Contradiction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction"}]}
