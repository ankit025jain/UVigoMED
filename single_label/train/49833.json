{"id":49833,"title":"Primary hyperparathyroidism: a case report.","abstract":"Primary hyperparathyroidism results from the excessive secretion of PTH and typically produces frank hypercalcaemia. With the advent of multiphasic screening of serum chemistries, it has been recognized that primary hyperparathyroidism is not an uncommon disorder. Here, a 32 years old lady with burning to colicky recurrent upper abdominal pain, polyuria, polydipsia associated with anorexia, dyspepsia, generalized body ache, joint pain, constipation and weight loss has been described. An initial abdominal ultrasound was performed at hospital and revealed features of cholelithiasis and bilateral nephrocalcinosis. Serum biochemistries revealed that her serum calcium was 12.60mg/dl, serum PTH was 222.80ng/dl, serum creatinine was 0.90mg/dl, 99 Tc-sestamibi scanning for parathyroid evaluation revealed features suggestive of parathyroid adenoma adjoining the lower pole of right lobe of thyroid gland. Bone densitometry of femur and spine by DEXA showed osteoporosis with T score value <-3.5 SD. Right hemithyroidectomy with parathyroid adenoma excision was performed. Patient was closely monitored. Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were markedly reduced near to the normal range within two weeks of surgery. Following five months after surgery, serum PTH was 29.59ng/dl, six months after surgery serum calcium was 9.2mg/dl. Patient is now in good physical condition and under regular follow up.
