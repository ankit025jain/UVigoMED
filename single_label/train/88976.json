{"id":88976,"title":"Revision hip arthroplasty using a modular revision hip system in cases of severe bone loss.","abstract":"We sought to identify outcomes of the Restoration Modular Hip System in cases of severe femoral bone stock deficiency. We performed a retrospective review of 55 revTHAs with a mean follow-up of 32 months (24-60 months). Outcomes included the WOMAC and HHS. Preoperative bone loss was categorized as Paprosky 3A (n = 13), 3B (n = 14), and 4 (n = 17). Periprosthetic fractures were classified as Vancouver B2 (n = 6) and B3 (n = 5). 53 of 55 stems were in situ at time of final review. WOMAC improved from 46 ± 18 to 70 ± 22 and HHS improved from 47 ± 15 to 78 ± 15. Complications were identified in 9 patients, which included dislocation (3), subsidence (2), infection (2), and periprosthetic fracture (2). In cases of significant proximal femoral bone deficiency, this stem demonstrated improvement in clinical outcomes with good results at short-term follow up.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768500","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.829799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.757228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.599758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.599321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.568255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.429714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Spaceflight osteopenia","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Subsidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidence"},{"name":"Vancouver","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver"},{"name":"United States Department of Health and Human Services","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Third baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Vitamin B12 deficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12_deficiency"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Restoration (England)","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_(England)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
