{"id":36368,"title":"Acquired autistic behaviors in children with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA.","abstract":"To assess autism spectrum disorder (ASD) behaviors in children with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA) using a standard measure, understand the behavioral evolution of the disease, and provide specific guidelines for diagnosis.Children (n = 21) with documented enzyme deficiency and SGSH gene mutations, cognitive age-equivalent >12 months, and early onset were administered the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (module 1) and Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Third Edition. ADOS Social Affect and Restricted Repetitive Behavior total scores, as well as Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Third Edition cognitive age-equivalent scores, are reported using descriptive statistics and graphic presentations.Thirteen of the 21 children evaluated met the ADOS criteria for ASD/autism. ADOS score was strongly associated with age; all 11 children aged >46 months met the criteria, compared with only 2 of 10 aged <46 months. Social and affective abnormalities were most frequent; restricted interests and repetitive behaviors were largely absent. Lack of cognitive growth paralleled ADOS score.An increased incidence of ASD-like social behaviors was seen at age 3-4 years in children with early-onset MPS IIIA. Although more frequent in the severely impaired children, ASD-like behaviors were observed across the entire range of cognitive impairment. Clinicians must be aware that when a child acquires ASD-like behaviors, MPS IIIA should be included in the differential diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582005","annotations":[{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.62656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.574279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.562484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule","weight":0.228079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Diagnostic_Observation_Schedule"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.167041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Mucopolysaccharidosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucopolysaccharidosis"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Modularity of mind","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_of_mind"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Acquired disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_disorder"}]}
