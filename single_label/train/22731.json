{"id":22731,"title":"[Paradoxical reaction during tuberculosis treatment in immunocompetent children: case report].","abstract":"Tuberculosis is an important public health problem. It is estimated that around 5-10% of patients with tuberculosis present with central nervous system involvement; meningitis and tuberculoma being two of the most frequent manifestations. The paradoxical reaction in patients undergoing antituberculosis treatment is infrequent, nevertheless it is an important consideration in patients, who after an appropriate initial response to specific treatment, present with worsening clinical and radiological signs or the appearance of new lesions.
