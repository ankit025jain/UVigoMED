{"id":78552,"title":"Prediction of frequency-specific hearing threshold using chirp auditory brainstem response in infants with hearing losses.","abstract":"To investigate the clinical usefulness of the LS-chirp auditory brainstem response for estimation of behavioral thresholds in young children with mild to severe hearing losses.68 infants (136 ears) aged 6-12 months (mean age=9.2 months) with bilateral mild to severe hearing losses were studied at Children's Hospital of Fudan University. In all cases, the children were referred for LS-chirp ABR and visual reinforcement audiometric (VRA) measurements. The low-frequency band chirp (LF-chirp) thresholds (frequency band=0.1-0.85kHz) were compared to the average VRA thresholds (frequency band=0.25-0.5kHz), whereas the high-frequency band chirp (HF-chirp) thresholds (frequency band=1-10kHz) were compared to the average VRA thresholds (frequency band=1-4kHz) using statistical correlation coefficient values.The LS-chirp ABR thresholds are very close to behavioral hearing levels. The mean differences between chirp-ABR and VRA thresholds were within 5dBHL for all measurements. The smallest mean threshold difference (<3dBHL) was obtained for the severe hearing loss group. The correlation coefficient values (r) were 0.97 at low-frequency and high-frequency bands. For each carrier frequency, the best correlations between chirp-ABR thresholds and VRA thresholds were obtained at VRA frequency of 0.25kHz/LF-chirp (r=0.98) and VRA frequency of 1kHz/HF-chirp (r=0.98).This study demonstrates the effectiveness using chirp-ABR predicted frequency-specific thresholds, especially of low and middle frequencies. LS-chirp ABR thresholds determined behavioral thresholds in patients with severe hearing losses were better than for mild hearing losses. The use of a chirp-ABR testing ensures higher sensitivity and accuracy than that of auditory stead-state evoked response (ASSR) for measuring frequency-specific thresholds in young children.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630052","annotations":[{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.712907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.628967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.598102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.488031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Absolute threshold of hearing","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold_of_hearing"},{"name":"Equal-loudness contour","weight":0.47031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.421073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.397581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Auditory brainstem response","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_brainstem_response"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.114072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Chirp","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Carrier wave","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_wave"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"}]}
