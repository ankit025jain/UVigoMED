{"id":81365,"title":"Dentist supply and children's oral health in the United States.","abstract":"We evaluated the relationship between dentist supply and children's oral health and explored heterogeneity by children's age and urbanicity.We obtained data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (>27,000 children aged 1-10 years; >23,000 children aged 11-17 years). We estimated the association between state-level dentist supply and multiple measures of children's oral health using regression analysis adjusting for several child, family, and population-level characteristics.Dentist supply was significantly related to better oral health outcomes among children aged 1 to 10 years. The odds of decay and bleeding gums were lower by more than 50% (odds ratio [OR]=0.46; 95% CI=0.23, 0.95) and 80% (OR=0.18; 95% CI=0.05, 0.76), respectively, with an additional dentist per 1000 population. The odds of a worse maternal rating of child's dental health on a 5-category scale from poor to excellent were lower by about 50% in this age group with an additional dentist per 1000 population (OR=0.51; 95% CI=0.29, 0.91). We observed associations only for children in urban settings.Dentist supply is associated with improved oral health for younger children in urban settings.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122013","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.500052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.246458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.222269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.0590835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"1117","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1117"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0164971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
