{"id":88838,"title":"Intra-articular lidocaine for reduction of shoulder dislocation.","abstract":"Anterior shoulder dislocation is the most common joint dislocation seen in the emergency department. Although emergency medicine providers use several techniques for reduction, each method is associated with potential discomfort for the patient. In addition, pain from the dislocated shoulder causes muscle spasm that impedes reduction. Therefore, both analgesia and procedural sedation are often used to reduce pain and enable reduction. Intra-articular injection of lidocaine has demonstrated efficacy in reduction of pain and facilitation of shoulder reduction compared with analgesia and sedation. Intra-articular lidocaine may also reduce time to successful reduction of shoulder dislocations.
