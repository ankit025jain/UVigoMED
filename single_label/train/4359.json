{"id":4359,"title":"[Research on competency building standards of institutions of schistosomiasis prevention and control in Hubei Province I Investigation of institution management].","abstract":"To investigate the current situation of management of institutions of schistosomiasis prevention and control in Hubei Province, so as to explore the probable competency building standards for these institutions at the county and township levels.By using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, the institutions of schistosomiasis prevention and control at county and township levels were investigated for the institutional setup, staffing and fulfillment functions since the reform of 2004.Among 63 schistosomiasis endemic counties (cities, districts) of Hubei Province, there were 26 independent schistosomiasis control institutions (41.27%), there were 24 institutions which were incorporated into CDC (38.10%), and there were no institutions in 13 counties (20.63%). Among 518 endemic towns, there were 299 institutions (57.72%). The total staffing size were 1 932, but there were 1 586 (82.09%) people actually working in the post, and therefore there were 346 (17.91%) empty positions. The average rates of carrying out the six functions were 91.48%-71.19%, but only 19.23% of the institutions participated in the comprehensive schistosomiasis control management project and its effect assessment.According to the management model for schistosomiasis control institutions under the current institutional mechanisms, we need a rigorous industry standard to constrain, guide and standardize the management and capacity-building of the institutions in different historical periods.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434148","annotations":[{"name":"Industry","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"History","weight":0.411913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.277517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"City","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.104308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.0633088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Municipal corporation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"346","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/346"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"932","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/932"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Wiktionary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary"},{"name":"Territorial authorities of New Zealand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_authorities_of_New_Zealand"},{"name":"Building code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_code"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Township","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Reform","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Prussian P 8","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_P_8"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"}]}
