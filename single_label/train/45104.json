{"id":45104,"title":"Five right hepatic vein reconstructions using the autologous saphenous vein in the right lobe living-donor liver transplant: a case report.","abstract":"In living-donor liver transplant, hepatic venous anomalies are not rare. Despite numerous techniques developed over the years, the best way of establishing a patent and durable hepatic drainage system remains controversial. We present a case where we successfully reconstructed 5 hepatic venous structures with a combination of direct anastomosis and saphenous vein interposition. Careful planning before surgery, and a customized approach for the patient on the back table, brought about successful results.
