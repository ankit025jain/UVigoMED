{"id":90074,"title":"[Comparison of internal fixation and semi-shoulder arthroplasty in treating proximal humerus comminuted fractures in elderly].","abstract":"To explore clinical effectiveness of internal fixation and semi-shoulder arthroplasty in treating proximal humerus comminuted fractures in elderly.From October 2009 and October 2011, 32 patients aged over 60 years old with three and four-part fractures of proximal humeral were treated with internal fixation (20 cases) and semi-shoulder arthroplasty (12 cases). In internal fixation group, there were 6 males and 14 females aged from 63 to 82 years old (ranged, 71.50 +/- 5.45), 8 cases with three-part fracture and 12 cases with four-part fracture, and treated with open reduction and locking plate internal fixation. While in semi-shoulder arthroplasty group, there were 4 males and 8 females aged from 61 to 85 years old (ranged, 72.80 +/- 6.80), 5 cases with three-part fracture and 7 cases with four-part fracture, and treated with semi-shoulder arthroplasty. Postoperative complications were observed, EQ-5D was used to evaluate quality of life, and Constant-Murley score was used to assess functional outcomes.All patients were followed up from 12 to 24 months with an average of 18 months. All injuries were healed at stage I . Two cases in internal fixation group occurred severe complications, including 1 case with screw fracture, 1 case with avascular necrosis of humeral head. EQ-5D in interal fixation group and semi-shoulder arthroplasty group were respectively 0.65 +/- 0.12, 0.67 +/- 0.12, Constant-Murley score respectively was 63.20 +/- 11.35 and 66.80 +/- 11.96, and with no statistical meaning between two goups (P>0.05).There is no difference in qulity of life and functional recovery for the treatment of proximal humerus comminuted fractures by open reduction and internal fixation and semi-shoulder arthroplasty. However, the complication rate in semi-shoulder arthroplasty was lower than that of internal fixation group.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654513","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.783403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.772743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.691531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.307246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.11984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0875014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0390912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Stage (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Equalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"}]}
