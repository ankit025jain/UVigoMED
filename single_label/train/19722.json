{"id":19722,"title":"Left ventricular assist device exchange for persistent infection: a case series and review of the literature.","abstract":"Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) exchange for control of infection may be an option for the treatment of persistent and severe infections of the LVAD. Data are limited regarding the indications for device exchange, methods for exchanging infected devices, post-exchange antimicrobial management, and outcomes of such patients. We report a series of cases in which an exchange was performed for persistent LVAD infection, review the literature on LVAD exchange and surgical techniques for these infectious complications, and suggest management strategies from a multidisciplinary perspective.
