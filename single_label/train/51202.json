{"id":51202,"title":"Ten years of the national genetic diabetes nurse network: a model for the translation of genetic information into clinical care.","abstract":"Increasing technological advances have resulted in the recognition of a range of genetic conditions not traditionally seen by clinical genetics teams. This has implications for the education of other healthcare professionals who may have insufficient knowledge to identify or support families with these conditions. The national genetic diabetes nurse (GDN) project, which trains diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs), was started in 2002 to increase awareness of monogenic diabetes among healthcare professionals across the UK. This paper describes the development and evaluation of the first 10 years of this project, indicating that GDNs have increased diagnostic referral rates and supported local families through diagnosis and treatment changes across the UK. The GDN project has proved an effective, innovative means of disseminating new genetic information from a centre of excellence and is suggested as a model for the successful and rapid dissemination of genetic information into routine clinical care in other conditions.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715120","annotations":[{"name":"Medical genetics","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_genetics"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.706065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.336834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.311427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0823991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Maturity onset diabetes of the young","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_young"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dissemination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissemination"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
