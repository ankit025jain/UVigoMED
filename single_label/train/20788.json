{"id":20788,"title":"[The experimental evaluation with flow cytofluorimetry technique of the level of cellular immunologic memory in persons vaccinated against plague and anthrax].","abstract":"The article deals with experimental evaluation with flow cytofluorimetry technique of the level of cellular immunologic memory in persons vaccinated with plague and anthrax live dry vaccines. It is established that the introduction of plague and anthrax live dry vaccines into organism of vaccinated persons ignites immunologic rearrangement manifested by reliable increase of level of blood concentration of Th1-lymphocytes (immunologic memory cells) against the background of vaccination. The higher correlation coefficient is detected between leucocytes lysis coefficient and stimulation coefficient according blood concentration level of T-lymphocytes predominantly at the expense of Th1-lymphocytes. The values of stimulation coefficient were calculated for corresponding blood cells of vaccinated persons. This data testifies the effectiveness of application of vaccination against plague and anthrax.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640112","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.731134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.711222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.614434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.546629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Anthrax","weight":0.241348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.223833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Bubonic plague","weight":0.107555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Memory B cell","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
