{"id":72236,"title":"It's more than dollars and cents: the impact of childhood cancer on parents' occupational and financial health.","abstract":"Few studies have evaluated the impact of childhood cancer on parents' occupational/financial status. This study explored parents' occupational/financial experiences posttreatment. Semistructured interviews were administered to 78 parents (44 mothers) of childhood cancer survivors diagnosed in the preceding 5 years. Transcripts were organized into themes using QSR NVivo8. Parents reported familial, psychological, and practical factors affecting their ability to return to work. Prioritizing family, reinstigating career progression, and negative workplace attitudes were particularly challenging. Parents of children with cancer experience substantial work-family conflict after their child's physical recovery from cancer. Family friendly policies and further research are recommended.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988134","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.646275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.612904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"War","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.045444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"NVivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVivo"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Transcription (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Exhibition game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game"},{"name":"Business English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_English"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Fast food","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"}]}
