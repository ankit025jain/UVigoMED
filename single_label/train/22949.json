{"id":22949,"title":"Leptospirosis serodiagnosis by the microscopic agglutination test.","abstract":"The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the gold standard for sero-diagnosis of leptospirosis because of its unsurpassed diagnostic specificity. It uses panels of live leptospires, ideally recent isolates, representing the circulating serovars from the area where the patient became infected. A dilution series of the patient's serum is mixed with a suspension of live leptospires in microtiter plates. After incubating for about 2 hr at 30Â°C, results are read under the dark-field microscope. The titer is the last dilution in which ? 50% of the leptospires have remained agglutinated. Seroconversion or ? 4-fold titer rise in paired sera is consistent with current leptospirosis. The significance of a titer in a single sample depends on the frequency of residual titers due to past infections and cross-reacting other diseases in the population. Full standardization of the MAT is not possible, but quality assurance can be achieved by participation in the international MAT proficiency testing scheme.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510846","annotations":[{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.445726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.307942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.217447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Leptospirosis","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Dark field microscopy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_field_microscopy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0842719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Agglutination (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination_(biology)"},{"name":"Serial dilution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_dilution"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Monoamine transporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_transporter"},{"name":"Microtiter plate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtiter_plate"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
