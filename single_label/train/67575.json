{"id":67575,"title":"Salvage surgical resection for isolated locally recurrent inguinal lymph node metastasis of penile cancer: international study collaboration.","abstract":"We assessed the merit of performing salvage inguinal lymph node dissection in those infrequent cases of penile cancer with locally recurrent inguinal lymph node metastases in the absence of other suspected sites of disease.A total of 20 patients were retrospectively identified as having undergone salvage inguinal lymph node dissection for locally recurrent penile cancer. Patients were previously treated with primary inguinal lymph node dissection with curative intent. At the time of salvage inguinal lymph node dissection, superficial and deep inguinal lymph node dissection was performed with resection outside of the standardized surgical template if there was inguinal recurrence outside of this region.All cases were primary penile squamous cell carcinomas. Median time to recurrence from initial inguinal lymph node dissection was 7.7 months (range 3.1Â to 35.0). At salvage inguinal lymph node dissection a median of 3 lymph nodes (range 1 to 17) was resected with a median of 2 (range 1 to 7) nodes positive for malignancy. Median overall survival after salvage inguinal lymph node dissection was 10.1 months (95% CI 1.9-18.3) and median disease specific survival after salvage inguinal lymph node dissection was 16.4 months (95% CI 5.1-27.8). Of the initial 20 patients 9 have no evidence of disease (median followup 12.0 months, range 7.1 to 70.1). Postoperative complications developed in 11 patients, including wound infections in 6, postoperative severe (debilitating) lymphedema in 4 and seroma in 1.Salvage inguinal lymph node dissection is a potentially curative treatment in patients with penile cancer with locally recurrent inguinal lymph node metastases in the absence of occult disease. Patients undergoing such salvage surgery should be informed of the high likelihood of postoperative complications.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603104","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.915853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.80318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma of the penis","weight":0.770182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma_of_the_penis"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.515544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.494631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.429746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Inguinal lymph node","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_lymph_node"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Seroma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Deep inguinal lymph nodes","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inguinal_lymph_nodes"}]}
