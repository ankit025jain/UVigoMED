{"id":55825,"title":"[Atopic keratoconjunctivitis].","abstract":"It is useful to define atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) as a non-infectious inflammatory condition of the ocular surface, which is associated with atopy. The pathogenesis of the disorder is not completely understood. The diagnosis is based on the patient's history and the clinical manifestations. Successful management of AKC, which can become a serious condition, requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves prevention, dermatological care and an adequate ophthalmological treatment algorithm.
