{"id":20500,"title":"Spread of virulent group A Streptococcus type emm59 from Montana to Wyoming, USA.","abstract":"Full-genome sequencing showed that a recently emerged and hypervirulent clone of group A Streptococcus type emm59 active in Canada and parts of the United States has now caused severe invasive infections in rural northeastern Wyoming. Phylogenetic analysis of genome data indicated that the strain was likely introduced from Montana.
