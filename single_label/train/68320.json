{"id":68320,"title":"Pioglitazone prevents cavernosal nerve injury after radical prostatectomy.","abstract":"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common consequence of radical prostatectomy (RP) and can affect a man's long-term quality of life. Intraoperative manipulation of the neurovascular bundle causes neuropraxia with resultant fibrosis and trabecular smooth-muscle damage. Pioglitazone is an anti-diabetic agent with recognized antifibrotic and vasculoprotective properties, which can protect smooth muscle function. We hypothesize that post-RP pioglitazone therapy can help preserve erectile function.
