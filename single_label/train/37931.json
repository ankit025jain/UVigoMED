{"id":37931,"title":"Native aortic valve endocarditis complicated by pseudoaneurysm of mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa.","abstract":"Pseudoaneurysm of mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa (PA-MAIVF) is a rare complication of native aortic valve endocarditis. This region is a relatively avascular area and prone to infection during endocarditis and subsequent aneurysm formation. The rupture into the pericardial cavity and left atrium or aorta, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction secondary to left coronary compression, and sudden death are the reported complications. Herein, we present a 9-year-old boy who was diagnosed with bicuspid aortic valve endocarditis complicated by PA-MAIVF, cerebral embolism, and hemorrhage. PA-MAIVF was visualized by both two- and three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography and ruptured into pericardial space causing a fatal outcome.
