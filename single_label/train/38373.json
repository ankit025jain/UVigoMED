{"id":38373,"title":"[Present-day possibilities of surgical management of tumour-like forms of arteriovenous angiodysplasias].","abstract":"Described herein is the treatment policy pursued in a relatively uncommonly encountered variant of congenital vascular pathology, i. e. arteriovenous angiodysplasias. We operated a total of twenty patients presenting with various localization of the pathology concerned. The patients average age amounted to 18 Â± 8.6 years. In order to make the diagnosis of the disease and to accomplish the tactical missions we used duplex scanning and angiography. According to the opinion of the authors, in this form of angiodysplasias using any method of treatment independently cannot be efficient. Arteriovenous angiodysplasias were treated by a combined method including endovascular embolisation or sclerotherapy of the afferent vessels and surgical removal of vascular formations. The use of such therapeutic policy makes it possible to attain positive results in 75% of patients.
