{"id":74971,"title":"Safety and tolerability of immune globulin intravenous (human), 10% solution in Japanese subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"Immune globulin intravenous (IGIV), 10% is a donor-derived polyclonal human immunoglobulin G antibody mixture that has potent immune modulatory properties and contains conformation selective anti-amyloid antibodies. We evaluated the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of IGIV, 10% in Japanese patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.Among the 16 subjects, 12 subjects were assigned to the IGIV group and 4 subjects to the placebo group. Subjects received a total of six infusions of either IGIV at a dose of 0.2 or 0.4?g/kg, or placebo every 2 weeks.A total of 33 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurred in 14 subjects: 13 TEAE in five subjects in both the IGIV 0.2 and 0.4?g/kg groups, and 7 TEAE in four subjects in the placebo group. The most common TEAE in the IGIV subjects were nasopharyngitis, injection-site swelling, and erythema. All 26 TEAE in the IGIV group were considered to be mild. Only one mild TEAE (rash) was considered to be possibly related to the study drug. There were no significant differences in incidence of TEAE between the treatment groups. Four serious TEAE were reported, and all of these were considered to be unrelated to the study treatment. Other assessments related to safety revealed neither clinically significant abnormal values nor findings in the study.IGIV is generally safe and well tolerated with multiple intravenous infusions at doses of 0.2?g/kg and 0.4?g/kg in Japanese patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25186799","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.801314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.514458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.357486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.325366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.271491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.221849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0896035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}]}
