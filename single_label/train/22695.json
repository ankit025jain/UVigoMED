{"id":22695,"title":"Assessing the impact of a pertussis active surveillance program on provider testing behavior, Minnesota 2005-2009.","abstract":"The Minnesota Department of Health, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, implemented the Pertussis Active Surveillance Project to better understand pertussis epidemiology. We evaluated the program's impact.Clinics in 2 counties were offered free diagnostic testing and an educational presentation covering pertussis epidemiology. Clinics were identified as either active or intermittent, with active clinics testing 33% or more of the total number of months enrolled. We used generalized estimating equations to assess changes in provider testing behavior over the project period.Ninety-seven clinics enrolled, with 38% classified as active. Active clinics were more likely to use the state lab for diagnostic testing and had a larger staff. During the project period, a decline in days coughing at the time of visit occurred in both jurisdictions.Providing clinics with free diagnostic testing influenced their participation levels. Among active clinics, results suggest changes in provider testing behavior over the course of the project. However, given the lack of robust participation, this resource-intensive strategy may not be a cost-effective approach to evaluating trends in pertussis epidemiology.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524507","annotations":[{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.649777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.633922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.473684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pertussis","weight":0.402918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.233498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.184544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Jurisdiction","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.130812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Estimating equations","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimating_equations"},{"name":"Health department","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"NSA warrantless surveillance controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy"}]}
