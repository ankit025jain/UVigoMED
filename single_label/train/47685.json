{"id":47685,"title":"A double-blind randomised controlled trial of fish oil-based versus soy-based lipid preparations in the treatment of infants with parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis.","abstract":"Infants receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) are at risk of PN-associated cholestasis (PNAC). This can progress to hepatic failure and death if PN cannot be discontinued. Fish oil-based parenteral lipid preparation (FOLP) has been shown to be beneficial in case studies.(1) To evaluate whether FOLP could halt or reverse the progression of PNAC compared with soy-based parenteral lipid preparation (SLP) and (2) to assess the effects of FOLP on liver function and physical growth.double-blind randomised controlled trial.level III neonatal intensive care unit.infants with PNAC (plasma-conjugated bilirubin concentration ? 34 µmol/l or 2 mg/dl) expected to be PN-dependent for >2 weeks.to receive either FOLP or SLP at 1.5 g/kg/day.reversal of PNAC within 4 months after commencement of lipid treatment; secondary outcomes: rate of change of weekly liver function tests, infant growth parameters, blood lipid profile and episodes of late-onset sepsis.A total of 9 infants were randomised to the FOLP group and 7 to the SLP group. There was no significant difference in reversal of PNAC at 4 months between groups. Rates of increase of plasma-conjugated bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase in the SLP group were significantly greater than the FOLP group (13.5 vs. 0.6 µmol/l per week and 9.1 vs. 1.1 IU/l per week, respectively, p = 0.03). Increased enteral nutrition was associated with significant improvement of PNAC in infants receiving FOLP compared with SLP (-8.5 vs. -1.6 µmol/l per 10% increase in enteral nutrition, respectively). The study was terminated prematurely.progression of PNAC in PN-dependent infants can be halted by replacing SLP with FOLP and reversed by increasing the proportion of enteral nutrition in infants receiving FOLP. Replacement of SLP with FOLP in PN-dependent infants who develop PNAC may be considered.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576844","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Nasogastric intubation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.733822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.380041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.343959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Enteral","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteral"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.1695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.113871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Graduation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation"},{"name":"Speech and language pathology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_and_language_pathology"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"}]}
