{"id":27748,"title":"Risk factors for current smoking among American and South Korean adolescents, 2005-2011.","abstract":"Population data concerning smoking rates of adolescents and adults in the United States and Korea (South Korea) has highlighted the need for attention to this age group. This study compared the risk factors related to smoking and examined the gender differences with other risk factors in smoking among American and Korean adolescents between 2005 and 2011.Participants were students in grades 9-11 selected from nationally representative surveys conducted in 2005 and 2011.In 2011, similar risk factors for current smoking were identified in American and Korean adolescents. These included male gender, school grade, depression, experience of alcohol drinking, current use of alcohol, use of glue or other inhalants, and experience of sexual intercourse. Among Korean adolescents, weight perception and weight control were unique risk factors for current smoking. Interactions with gender and other risk factors in each nation were revealed.These risk factors, their change from earlier years, and gender differences should be recognized in the screening of vulnerable individuals for smoking and formulating effective intervention programs.These results will provide information for the design and implementation of cessation programs for adolescents in these countries.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25224519","annotations":[{"name":"South
