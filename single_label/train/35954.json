{"id":35954,"title":"A comparison of paravertebral nerve block catheters and thoracic epidural catheters for postoperative analgesia following the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum repair.","abstract":"Thoracic epidurals (TE) have been advocated as a superior method for controlling postoperative pain after repair of pectus excavatum with a Nuss procedure. However, three recent reports of permanent neurologic injury after the Nuss procedure with concurrent TE analgesia have raised concerns about the safety of this combination. Paravertebral nerve blocks (PVNB) are used successfully for analgesia of the chest, but no studies are available comparing TE and PVNB catheters for postoperative analgesia in this patient population. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of PVNB catheters with TE catheters for postoperative analgesia in pediatric patients undergoing the Nuss procedure.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 20 adolescent males undergoing a thoracoscopic Nuss procedure with either bilateral PVNB catheters (n = 10) or TE catheter (n = 10) and compared postoperative opiate consumption and pain scores.There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to demographics, opiate consumption measured in morphine equivalents, and pain scores.In this small series, bilateral PVNB catheters resulted in equivalent opioid consumption and pain scores when compared to TE for postoperative pain management in pediatric patients undergoing the Nuss procedure. Large prospective studies are needed to further compare the efficacy, incidence of side effects, and complications of TE and PVNB catheters for postoperative analgesia in this pediatric population.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612096","annotations":[{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Opiate","weight":0.78094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.753171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.725075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.68777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.590524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nerve block","weight":0.501987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_block"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.461374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.402019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.296392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.114027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Pectus excavatum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_excavatum"},{"name":"Nuss procedure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuss_procedure"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
