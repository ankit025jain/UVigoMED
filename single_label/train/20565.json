{"id":20565,"title":"Cloning and expression of a recombinant CagA -gene fragment of Helicobacter pylori and its preliminary evaluation in serodiagnosis.","abstract":"Helicobacter pylori strains expressing cytotoxic CagA protein are more commonly associated with peptic ulceration, atrophic gastritis and gastric adenocarcinoma than those lacking CagA. Determination of anti-CagA antibodies, therefore, acquires a relevant clinical significance in the serological detection of H. pylori infection and disease risk prediction. However, the CagA-serology has been questioned due to the differences found in their performance evaluations in different populations.To obtain a recombinant CagA fragment useful for serodiagnosis of H. pylori infectionA fragment of the cagA gene was cloned into a prokaryotic T7 RNA polymerase expression vector. A recombinant C-terminal His 6 -tagged CagA was expressed, subsequently solubilized with urea and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The performance of the recombinant protein was evaluated using 180 human serum samples with an in-house Western blot assay compared to the Helicoblot 2.1 reference test.The expressed His 6 -tagged CagA showed an immunoreactive 80kDa band as was revealed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using two different specific anti-CagA polyclonal antibodies. The recombinant protein was successfully purified obtaining a 93% of purity. The performance analysis of the purified recombinant antigen showed good immunoreactivity and exhibited values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 88.1%, 100% and 92.7%, respectively.The CagA fragment of the study may constitute a useful tool for serological diagnosis of CagA-positive H. pylori infection.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
