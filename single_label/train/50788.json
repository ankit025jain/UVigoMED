{"id":50788,"title":"The type 1 diabetes resistance locus B10 Idd9.3 mediates impaired B-cell lymphopoiesis and implicates microRNA-34a in diabetes protection.","abstract":"NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice are congenic for the insulin-dependent diabetes (Idd) Idd9.3 locus, which confers significant type 1 diabetes (T1D) protection and encodes 19 genes, including microRNA (miR)-34a, from T1D-resistant C57BL/10 mice. B cells have been shown to play a critical role in the priming of autoantigen-specific CD4(+) T cells in T1D pathogenesis in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. We show that early B-cell development is impaired in NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice, resulting in the profound reduction of transitional and mature splenic B cells as compared with NOD mice. Molecular analysis revealed that miR-34a expression was significantly higher in B-cell progenitors and marginal zone B cells from NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice than in NOD mice. Furthermore, miR-34a expression in these cell populations inversely correlated with levels of Foxp1, an essential regulator of B-cell lymphopoiesis, which is directly repressed by miR-34a. In addition, we show that islet-specific CD4(+) T cells proliferated inefficiently when primed by NOD.B10 Idd9.3 B cells in vitro or in response to endogenous autoantigen in NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice. Thus, Idd9.3-encoded miR-34a is a likely candidate in negatively regulating B-cell lymphopoiesis, which may contribute to inefficient expansion of islet-specific CD4(+) T cells and to T1D protection in NOD.B10 Idd9.3 mice.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752729","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.8309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.808385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.756556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.716845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.42341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Molecular genetics","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Marginal zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_zone"},{"name":"Congenic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenic"},{"name":"Lymphopoiesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphopoiesis"},{"name":"Idd","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idd"},{"name":"NOD mice","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOD_mice"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Fuel efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency"},{"name":"Primer (paint)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(paint)"},{"name":"B-10 recoilless rifle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-10_recoilless_rifle"},{"name":"Toyota C transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_C_transmission"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"}]}
