{"id":18341,"title":"Optimum outlier model for potential improvement of environmental cleaning and disinfection.","abstract":"The effectiveness and efficiency of 17 housekeepers in terminal cleaning 292 hospital rooms was evaluated through adenosine triphosphate detection. A subgroup of housekeepers was identified who were significantly more effective and efficient than their coworkers. These optimum outliers may be used in performance improvement to optimize environmental cleaning.
