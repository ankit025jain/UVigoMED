{"id":42609,"title":"Risk factor evaluation for postoperative complications in laparoscopic colorectal surgery by a classic severity grading system.","abstract":"Using the uniform complication grading system to evaluate postoperative complications after laparoscopic colorectal surgery is the purpose of the present study. Surgical complications were defined as grades I, II, III, IV, and V recommended by Dindo et al. Patients were categorized into three pairs: complication group (CG) and non-complication group (NCG), minor complication group (MiCG, grades I-II) and non-minor complication group (NMiCG), and major complication group (MaCG, grades III-V) and non-major complication group (NMaCG); of the 570 patients, 431 patients were discharged with no complications, and 174 complications occurred in 119 patients. The percent of grades I, II, III, IV, and V complications were 4.7, 20, 4.7, 0.7, and 0.4 %, respectively. Complications were significantly associated with male gender, larger tumor volume, and more estimated blood loss (EBL). The multivariate analysis revealed that male and EBL ?150 ml were found to be independent predictors of postoperative complications. In subgroup analysis, patients with larger tumor volume were at significantly higher risk of postoperative major complications, and male gender and EBL ?150 ml remained independent predictors of developing minor postoperative complications. Patients with postoperative complications would significantly experience longer hospital stay, later fluid intake, and delayed urinary catheter removal. Male, larger tumor volume, and more EBL were significant risk factors for laparoscopic colorectomy.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840635","annotations":[{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.774507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Urinary catheterization","weight":0.722455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_catheterization"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.711738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.642497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.453039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.401717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.331089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.284532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.155832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"431","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/431"},{"name":"570","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/570"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Pair skating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_skating"},{"name":"English Basketball League","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Basketball_League"}]}
