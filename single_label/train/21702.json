{"id":21702,"title":"Target selection for structural genomics of infectious diseases.","abstract":"This chapter describes the protocols used to identify, filter, and annotate potential protein targets from an organism associated with infectious diseases. Protocols often combine computational approaches for mining information in public databases or for checking whether the protein has already been targeted for structure determination, with manual strategies that examine the literature for information on the biological role of the protein or the experimental strategies that explore the effects of knocking out the protein. Publicly available computational tools have been cited as much as possible. Where these do not exist, the concepts underlying in-house tools developed for the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases have been described.
