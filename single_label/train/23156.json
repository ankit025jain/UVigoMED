In membrane plasmapheresis application the reduction of pain and improvement of general condition observed rapidly. By the end of the second day the activity of amylase decreased by 53% urea and creatinine level--by 62 and 56% compared with baseline. Decreasing of the necrotic suppurative complications rate in the main group--15.4%, in control--32.8%, mortality--accordinty 14.1 and 27.6%.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501923","annotations":[{"name":"Urea","weight":0.856384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.733426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.404844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Plasmapheresis","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0533769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Endotoxemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxemia"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"}]}
