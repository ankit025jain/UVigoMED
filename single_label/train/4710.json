{"id":4710,"title":"[Calcium and phosphorus content in erupted and impacted teeth enamel. The study in vivo].","abstract":"This study shows that there are significant differences in the content of minerals in the enamel of the teeth to erupt in the near future after the eruption. Based on the data it can be concluded that immediately after the eruption of the tooth enamel entering the aggressive environment oral loses a certain amount of minerals. This explains the high dental caries is in the first fern years after the eruption. All figures are of high relevance in the planning of prevention.
