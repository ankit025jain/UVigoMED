{"id":91896,"title":"[Management of chemical burns and inhalation poisonings in acute medical care procedures of the State Fire Service].","abstract":"Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were founded by the government to perform tasks aimed at providing people with help in life-threatening conditions. The system comprises two constituent parts. The first one is public administrative bodies which are to organise, plan, coordinate and supervise the completion of the tasks. The other constituent is EMS units which keep people, resources and units in readiness. Supportive services, which include: the State Fire Service (SFS) and the National Firefighting and Rescue System (NFRS), are of great importance for EMS because they are eligible for providing acute medical care (professional first aid). Acute medical care covers actions performed by rescue workers to help people in life-threatening conditions. Rescue workers provide acute medical care in situations when EMS are not present on the spot and the injured party can be accessed only with the use of professional equipment by trained workers of NFRS. Whenever necessary, workers of supportive services can assist paramedics' actions. Cooperation of all units of EMS and NFRS is very important for rescue operations in the integrated rescue system. Time is a key aspect in delivering first aid to a person in life-threatening conditions. Fast and efficient first aid given by the accident's witness, as well as acute medical care performed by a rescue worker can prevent death and minimise negative effects of an injury or intoxication. It is essential that people delivering first aid and acute medical care should act according to acknowledged and standardised procedures because only in this way can the process of decision making be sped up and consequently, the number of possible complications following accidents decreased. The present paper presents an analysis of legal regulations concerning the management of chemical burn and inhalant intoxication in acute medical care procedures of the State Fire Service. It was observed that the procedures for rescue workers entitled to provide acute medical care should be correlated with the procedures for emergency medical teams.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466708","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"First aid","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid"},{"name":"Paramedic","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic"},{"name":"Firefighter","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Firefighting","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.566379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.547026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Fire","weight":0.394513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire"},{"name":"Rescue","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.368039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.148919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.120576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Witness","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Inhalant abuse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalant_abuse"},{"name":"Chemical burn","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_burn"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Standards organization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Political party","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party"},{"name":"Efficiency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
