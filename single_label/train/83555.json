{"id":83555,"title":"[The biotropic weather conditions and changing the clocks as the extraneous risk factors of weather-dependent exacerbations of chronic diseases].","abstract":"This paper reports the results of medico-meteorological investigations suggesting the influence of biotropic (unfavourabe) weather conditions characteristic of transient seasons in combination with the abolition of <winter time> on the frequency of application for emergency medical aid. It was shown that the abolition of <winter time> during the period from 2009 to 2013 resulted in a significant rise in the frequency of application for the emergency treatment of exacerbation of cardiovascular diseases. The sociological studies involving the responders of various social and age groups carried out parallel to the medical ones demonstrated that most of them (77%) considered the abolition of <winter time> to be the main cause of the deteriorated of the sense of wellbeing and emphasized the necessity of winter time reversal.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25314766","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sociology","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.420925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.348449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.310706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Weather","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Abolitionism","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Series and parallel circuits","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"}]}
