{"id":62033,"title":"The impact of race, age, and sex in follicular lymphoma: A comprehensive SEER analysis across consecutive treatment eras.","abstract":"The impact of race/ethnicity and the additional factors of age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) on follicular lymphoma (FL) outcomes have not been comprehensively studied and are not well defined. We examined population-based FL data from >18,000 patients in SEER-13 (1992-2009) investigating race/ethnicity and the impact of relevant factors including sex, age, and SES. Further, we compared data over two consecutive periods: Era-1 (1992-2000, n = 8,355) and Era-2 (2001-2009, n = 10,475). We identified 18,830 FL patients (White: n = 15,116; Hispanic: n = 1,627; Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI): n = 1,002; and Black: n = 846). Median ages (years) differed significantly by race/ethnicity: White: 62.1, Hispanic: 57.3, A/PI: 60.7, and Black: 56.8 (P < 0.01 each race versus White). Overall survival (OS) was superior in Era-2 versus Era-1 for all patients (5-year: 76.7% versus 67.4%, respectively, P < 0.001). Further, survival was significantly improved for all age groups <80 years, for males (P = 0.0019), and females (P < 0.001) across eras. Females had superior OS compared with males in Era-1 (P = 0.004), but not in Era-2. Additionally, all races, except A/PI, had improved 5-year OS rates from Era-1 to Era-2. Finally, OS improved across eras for lower and higher SES populations; however those with higher SES were superior to lower SES patients in both eras. In conclusion, and in the largest comprehensive evaluation of US-based FL patients to date, we show that despite improvements in OS for FL over time, critical disparities across races/ethnicities, sex, and age groups remain in the modern era and warrant further studies.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633911","annotations":[{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.475686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.341925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0935803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Warrant (law)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)"},{"name":"Modern history","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_history"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Application programming interface","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/627"},{"name":"846","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/846"},{"name":"830","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/830"},{"name":"355","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/355"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Wiktionary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary"},{"name":"Well-definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-definition"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Seasonal energy efficiency ratio","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
