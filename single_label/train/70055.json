{"id":70055,"title":"Melanoma in non-caucasian populations.","abstract":"Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer and the sixth leading cause of malignancy in the United States. Non-Caucasians have a decreased overall incidence of melanoma, but African Americans and other ethnic groups often have more advanced disease at initial diagnosis and higher mortality rates than Caucasian populations. Patients with more darkly pigmented skin have a higher percentage of acral lentiginous melanoma, which presents on the palms, soles, and subungual sites and carries specific genetic alterations. Increased awareness of melanoma presentation in pigmented skin may help reduce disparities between ethnic groups.
