{"id":90413,"title":"Florida Department of Health workers' response to 2004 hurricanes: a qualitative analysis.","abstract":"Examinations of the demands on public health workers after disaster exposure have been limited. Workers provide emergency care while simultaneously risking injury, damage to personal property, and threats to their own and their family's safety. We examined the disaster management experiences of 4323 Florida Department of Health workers 9 months after their response to 4 hurricanes and 1 tropical storm during a 7-week period in August and September of 2004.Participants completed a self-report questionnaire focused on work performance, mental and physical health, daily functioning, sleep disturbance, physiological arousal, and injury and work demand at the time of the hurricanes, and answered open-ended questions that described their experiences in more detail.A qualitative analysis conducted from the write-in data yielded 4 domains: (1) work/life balance; (2) training for disaster response role; (3) workplace support; and (4) recovery.Study findings highlighted a number of concerns that are important to public health workers who provide emergency care after a disaster and, in particular, multiple disasters such as during the 2004 hurricane season. The findings also yielded important recommendations for emergency public health preparedness.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618166","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.682275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.606279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.580612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.481543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.436965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Storm","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.245686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.197283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Personal property","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Disaster response","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_response"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"2004 Atlantic hurricane season","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Department of Health (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Riot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot"},{"name":"Sexual arousal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal"},{"name":"Pleasure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"}]}
