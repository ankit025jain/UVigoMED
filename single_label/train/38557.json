{"id":38557,"title":"Prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs and dental agenesis.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate the association between prenatal exposure to AEDs and the risk of dental agenesis and to differentiate between the possible effects of the different drugs used.Data on 214 exposed and 255 unexposed children, aged 12-18 years, were extracted from the Prescription Database of the Central Denmark Region and North Denmark Region and the Danish Medical Birth Registry. The children's dental charts were examined for the presence of dental agenesis.Overall, children exposed to AED in utero had an increased risk of developing dental agenesis, but as a group, the difference was not significant (OR?=?1.7; [95% CI: 0.8-3.6]). The risk of developing dental agenesis was three-fold increased (OR?=?3.1; [95% CI: 1.3-7.4]) in children exposed to valproate in mono- or in poly-therapy with other AEDs than carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. The risk was further increased (OR?=?11.2; [95% CI: 2.4-51.9]) in children exposed to valproate and carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine in combination.The present study shows that dental agenesis is a potential congenital abnormality that is related to prenatal exposure to valproate, and dental agenesis may be considered a sensitive marker for the teratogenicity of valproate.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24416231","annotations":[{"name":"Carbamazepine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine"},{"name":"Teratology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"In utero","weight":0.772597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_utero"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.752008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Valproic acid","weight":0.742603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproic_acid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.710218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.651464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Oxcarbazepine","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxcarbazepine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.227397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.220191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.174226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Central Denmark Region","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Denmark_Region"},{"name":"North Denmark Region","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Denmark_Region"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Agenesis","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenesis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"1218","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1218"},{"name":"255","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Infectious mononucleosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Civil registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_registry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Smoking and pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_and_pregnancy"}]}
