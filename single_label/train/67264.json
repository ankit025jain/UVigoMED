{"id":67264,"title":"Evaluation of exposure to trihalomethanes in tap water and semen quality: a prospective study in Wuhan, China.","abstract":"Trihalomethanes (THMs) have been demonstrated to adversely affect male reproductive health in animals, but the evidence in humans is limited. The study aimed to examine the association between THM exposure and semen quality in a Chinese population. We recruited 324 men from the same water supply district in Wuhan, China between April 2011 and May 2012. Exposure to THMs was evaluated based on their concentrations in tap water measured within 90 days preceding semen collection, the uptake factors of THMs and personal information on ingestion and showering/bathing. We found that TTHM [sum of chloroform (TCM) and brominated THMs (Br-THMs)], TCM and Br-THM uptakes via ingestion were associated with significant or suggestive decreasing trends in sperm concentration (P for trend=0.01, 0.03 and 0.05, respectively) and sperm count (P for trend=0.02, 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). Our results suggest that THM exposure via ingestion may adversely affect semen quality.
