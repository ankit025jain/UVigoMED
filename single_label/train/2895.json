{"id":2895,"title":"[New algorithm of aqueous humor dynamics assessment in glaucoma].","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to develop a new algorithm of aqueous humor dynamics assessment in glaucomatous eyes, which would take into account the shape of the tonographic curve and individual elastic properties of the corneoscleral capsule. Basic ophthalmic examination supplemented with tonography and differentiated tonometry was performed on 33 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), 8 POAG suspects, and 9 healthy controls. Obtained data were processed in accordance with the developed algorithm. A new formula for calculating the coefficient of outflow facility and several additional parameters describing the condition of aqueous pathways were proposed. In POAG patients these parameters significantly differed from those in healthy controls.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306716","annotations":[{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Aqueous humour","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"},{"name":"Tonometry","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonometry"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Humour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Formula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Elastic modulus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
