{"id":66719,"title":"Novel missense mutation in the FH gene in familial renal cell cancer patients lacking cutaneous leiomyomas.","abstract":"Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is a rare tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and papillary type 2 renal cell cancer. Germline mutation of the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene is known to be associated with HLRCC.We describe a 64-year-old father and his 39-year-old son with HLRCC who developed papillary type 2 RCCs lacking cutaneous leiomyomas at any site. A common missense mutation in the FH gene, (c.1021G?>?A, p.D341N) in exon 7, was detected in the 2 cases. Functional prediction with the bioinformatics programs, SIFT and Polyphen-2, reported \"damaging (SIFT score 0.00)\" and \"probably damaging (PSIC score 1.621)\" values, respectively. In 162 healthy individuals, there were no cases of a G transition to any base. Finally, (c.1021G?>?A) in exon 7, was identified as a point mutation.We report a family with HLRCC in which a novel missense mutation was detected. A familial papillary type 2 renal cancer should be considered HLRCC unless typical cutaneous leiomyomas do not occur.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684806","annotations":[{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Germline mutation","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline_mutation"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.629067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Fumaric acid","weight":0.505069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumaric_acid"},{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.444004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.435803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Fumarase","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumarase"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Hydration reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydration_reaction"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
