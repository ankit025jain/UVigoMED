{"id":69166,"title":"Kernel-based learning from both qualitative and quantitative labels: application to prostate cancer diagnosis based on multiparametric MR imaging.","abstract":"Building an accurate training database is challenging in supervised classification. For instance, in medical imaging, radiologists often delineate malignant and benign tissues without access to the histological ground truth, leading to uncertain data sets. This paper addresses the pattern classification problem arising when available target data include some uncertainty information. Target data considered here are both qualitative (a class label) or quantitative (an estimation of the posterior probability). In this context, usual discriminative methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM), fail either to learn a robust classifier or to predict accurate probability estimates. We generalize the regular SVM by introducing a new formulation of the learning problem to take into account class labels as well as class probability estimates. This original reformulation into a probabilistic SVM (P-SVM) can be efficiently solved by adapting existing flexible SVM solvers. Furthermore, this framework allows deriving a unique learned prediction function for both decision and posterior probability estimation providing qualitative and quantitative predictions. The method is first tested on synthetic data sets to evaluate its properties as compared with the classical SVM and fuzzy-SVM. It is then evaluated on a clinical data set of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance images to assess its performances in discriminating benign from malignant tissues. P-SVM is shown to outperform classical SVM as well as the fuzzy-SVM in terms of probability predictions and classification performances, and demonstrates its potential for the design of an efficient computer-aided decision system for prostate cancer diagnosis based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Male Urogenital
