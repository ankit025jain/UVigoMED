{"id":80901,"title":"Epidemiological aspects of hydatidosis in children, in some areas of north-eastern Romania.","abstract":"Hydatid cyst is a major public health problem in the pediatric population, both in terms of its frequency and of its endemic character in certain regions. The aim of the study was to present the incidence of hydatidosis in children who were hospitalized in pediatric clinics specialized in surgery of the Emergency Hospital for Children \"St. Maria\" from lasi.Prospective study conducted in the interval 2008-2012 in a series of 194 children patients from Moldova, Romania.The peak incidence of the hydatid disease is located around the age of 11-14 years (33%) in male patients (55%) from rural areas (79%) and families with low socioeconomic level. The hepatic localization of the hydatid cyst (50.51%) among children was more common than pulmonary localization (16.49%). Liver and lung localization was found in 22.16% of cases.Hydatidosis remains a major health problem requiring drastic measures to limit the spread and transmission of the parasite in humans, primarily by reducing the number of stray dogs.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502045","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.70277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.536095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.515082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Moldova","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.122553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mary (mother of Jesus)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"1114","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1114"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States_(U.S._Census_Bureau)"},{"name":"The Emergency (Ireland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Free-ranging urban dog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-ranging_urban_dog"},{"name":"Lasi","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasi"},{"name":"Feral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Hospital emergency codes","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_emergency_codes"}]}
