{"id":47773,"title":"Hyperamylasemia is associated with increased intestinal permeability in patients undergoing diagnostic oral double-balloon enteroscopy.","abstract":"To investigate the correlations between serum amylase levels, intestinal permeability (IP), and pancreatic injury and to explore the mechanisms responsible for hyperamylasemia in double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE).A prospective study was conducted in 20 patients who underwent DBE from August 1, 2008 to February 28, 2009. Serum amylase was examined 0, 2, 6 and 24 h post-DBE, C-reactive protein and lipase were examined at 24 h, and urine lactulose, mannitol, and trypsinogen-II (TRY-II) levels were measured at 6 h. Lactulose/mannitol ratio indicated IP, and TRY-II indicated pancreatic injuries. Procedure duration and enteroscope insertion length were recorded.Twelve patients underwent oral DBE (M:F, 5:7; mean age 50.42 ± 11.11 years) and 8 underwent anal DBE (M:F, 5:3; mean age 44.75 ± 12.66 years). They all showed significantly increased post-DBE serum amylase. Amylase and lipase levels were higher in the oral DBE group (P < 0.05). Hyperamylasemia was diagnosed in 9 (75.0%) patients undergoing oral DBE. Only patients receiving oral DBE showed increased post-procedure IP, which correlated with increased serum amylase (r = 0.611, P = 0.035) and procedure duration (r = 0.668, P = 0.018). Adverse events included one oral case with pancreatic injury (elevated TRY-II) and two cases of abdominal discomfort in each group. Pancreatitis was not reported.Hyperamylasemia correlates with increased IP and clinically undetectable pancreatic injuries. DBE could cause intestinal mucosa damage, which may result in IP elevation and increased amylase absorption, necessitating improvements and standardization of DBE methods.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574723","annotations":[{"name":"Mannitol","weight":0.91782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannitol"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Lipase","weight":0.745682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.697117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.643164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.530174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.421898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Intestinal mucosa","weight":0.326696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_mucosa"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.323648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Order of the British Empire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire"},{"name":"Lactulose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactulose"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"}]}
