{"id":45064,"title":"Association of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy with reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B: a nationwide cohort study.","abstract":"Treatment for hepatitis B virus infection reduces the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the long-term protective effects for subgroups of patients with chronic hepatitis B are unclear.We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2010). Cumulative incidences were calculated and multivariable analyses were carried out after adjusting for competing mortality. Propensity scores were used to match 21,595 patients with chronic hepatitis B who received nucleoside analogue therapy for at least 90 days (treated cohort) with 21,595 untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B (controls), who received hepatoprotectants for at least 90 days. Data were collected from the treated cohort for a mean period of 3.46 years and from controls for 5.24 years.The treated cohort had a significantly lower 7-year incidence of HCC (7.32%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.77%-7.87%) than controls (22.7%; 95% CI, 22.1%-23.3%; P < .001). After adjusting for competing mortality and other confounders, nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment was associated with a reduced risk of HCC, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.37 (95% CI, 0.34-0.39; P < .001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the association between nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment and reduced risk of HCC. Age, sex, cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus modified this association.Based on a retrospective, nationwide study in Taiwan, nucleoside analogue therapy use is associated with reduced risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704525","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.693393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.674766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.627521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.595661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.555119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0548502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Nucleoside","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Nucleoside analogue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside_analogue"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Propensity probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_probability"},{"name":"National health insurance","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance"}]}
