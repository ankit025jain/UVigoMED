{"id":30114,"title":"Validation of a prediction rule for endocarditis in febrile injection drug users.","abstract":"Infectious endocarditis (IE) in febrile injection drug users (IDUs) is a critical diagnosis to identify in the emergency department (ED). A decision tool that identifies patients at very low risk for endocarditis using readily available clinical data could reduce admissions and cost.To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a previously derived decision instrument to rule out endocarditis in febrile IDUs (Prediction Rule for Endocarditis in Injection Drug Users [PRE-IDU]) and to develop a prediction model for likelihood of endocarditis for those who are not ruled out by PRE-IDU.Febrile IDUs admitted to rule out endocarditis were prospectively enrolled from 2 urban EDs in June 2007 to March 2011. Clinical data from ED presentation (first 6 hours) and outcome data from inpatient records were recorded and reviewed by 2 independent investigators. Diagnosis of IE was based on modified Duke criteria and discharge summaries. The diagnostic performance of PRE-IDU, which combines tachycardia, cardiac murmur, and absence of skin infection, was determined using recursive partitioning and logistic regression modeling.Of the 249 subjects, 18 (7%) had IE. Recursive partitioning yielded an instrument with 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 84%-100%) and 100% negative predictive value (95% CI, 91%-100%), but low specificity (13%; 95% CI, 12%-13%). Multiple logistic regression modeling with the 3 clinical predictors allowed risk stratification with posttest probabilities ranging from 3% to 20%.The PRE-IDU instrument predicted IE with high sensitivity and ruled out IE with high negative predictive value. Our logistic regression model provided posttest probabilities ranging from 3% to 20%. The PRE-IDU instrument and the associated model may help guide hospital admission and diagnostic testing in evaluation of febrile IDUs in the ED.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560394","annotations":[{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.893369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.681468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.655636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.596628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.502722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.461139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Recursive partitioning","weight":0.376208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_partitioning"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.315169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.150191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Heart murmur","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_murmur"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
