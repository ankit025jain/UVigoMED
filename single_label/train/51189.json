{"id":51189,"title":"Obesity and the prevalence of diabetes and diabetes-related cardiovascular comorbidities in Delaware.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to determine the relative associations of obesity with the prevalence of diabetes and diabetes-related cardiovascular comorbidities in Delaware. Compelling research evidence demonstrates that obesity is a major independent risk factor both for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Analysis was conducted using Delaware data for 4,777 respondents from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).The likelihood of having diabetes and diabetes-related cardiovascular (CVD) comorbidities increased with Body Mass Index (BMI). Compared with normal-weight adults, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for diabetes was 7.14 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 4.70-10.83) and 2.54 (95 percent CI, 1.65-3.92); OR for diabetes and comorbid hypertension was 9.93 (95 percent CI, 5.82-16.93) and 3.66 (95 percent CI 2.13-6.30); OR for diabetes and high cholesterol OR was 6.76 (95 percent CI, 3.98-11.48) and 3.09 (95 percent CI,1.78-5.37); and the OR for diabetes and heart disease was 7.64 (95 percent CI, 3.15-18.50) and 3.82 (95 percent CI, 1.42-10.30) in obese and overweight adult Delawareans, respectively.One of the objectives of Healthy People 2020 is to reduce the rate of cardiovascular disease deaths in persons with diagnosed diabetes. Findings from this study provide compelling local data for health professionals to prioritize and implement evidence based obesity prevention and control interventions among persons with diagnosed diabetes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular comorbidities.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716385","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.846825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.830684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.707902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.513143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_Risk_Factor_Surveillance_System"},{"name":"Delaware","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
