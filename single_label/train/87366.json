{"id":87366,"title":"[Therapeutic effects of treatment of posterior malleolar fractures with medial-extension type through posterioromedial and posteriorlateral incision].","abstract":"To explore clinical outcomes of posterior malleolar fractures with medial-extension type through posterioromedial and posteriorlateral incision.From January 2008 to January 2011,25 patients with posterior malleolar fractures with medial-extension type were treated by hollow lag screw. Among them, 15 patients were treated through posteromedial incision,including 9 males and 6 females,aged from 21 to 67 years old with an average of 48.1 +/- 1.3; there were 5 cases with type A, 6 cases with type B and 4 cases with type C,according to Denis-Weber classification. Ten patients were treated by through posterior-lateral incision,including 6 males and 4 females, aged from 23 to 64 years old with an average of 46.9 +/- 1.5; there were 3 cases with type A, 5 cases with type B and 2 cases with type C,according to Denis-Weber classification. Operation time, blood loss, length of incision, times of X-ray exposure and complications of two groups were recorded and compared, Baird-Jackson effective evaluation were applied for evaluate clinical outcomes.All patients were followed up from 12 to 49 months with an average of 20.6 months. There were significant differences in operation time, blood loss, times of X-ray exposure and complications between two group (P < 0.05). While there was no obvious meaning in clinical outcomes between two groups (P > 0.05).Treating posterior malleolar fractures with medial-extension type through posteromedial approach can expose and fix fracture under direct vision, has advantages of shorter operation time, less X-ray exposure and blood loss, is a good choice of surgical approach.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241470","annotations":[{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.699113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.474758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.366738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Hollow-point bullet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow-point_bullet"},{"name":"2008 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Malleus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus"},{"name":"AC power plugs and sockets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Lag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
