{"id":26003,"title":"Role of MicroRNAs in Endothelial Progenitor Cells: Implication for Cardiac Repair.","abstract":"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are mobilized after myocardial infarction (MI) from the bone marrow to injured sites of the heart where they participate in cardiac repair by revascularization of ischemic tissues. Endothelial progenitor cells have been actively studied, but their exact phenotype and regenerative properties are still controversial. Small trials with progenitor cells of different origins showed modest clinical benefits. It is assumed that a better understanding of the biology of EPC will contribute to improve their therapeutic potential. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-stranded non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression by interacting post transcriptionally with protein-coding RNAs. MicroRNAs regulate multiple biological processes involved in cardiac development and disease. While many studies addressed the role of miRNAs in cardiac cells, less is known of the effect of miRNAs in EPC. Recent studies showed that miRNAs indeed regulate the biology of EPC. Since novel technologies to enhance or blunt the functions of miRNAs have been recently developed, it is conceivable that miRNAs may become promising new therapeutic tools. This article will review the recent advances in the knowledge of the effects of miRNAs in EPC and will discuss how miRNAs could be manipulated to improve the regenerative capacities of EPC in the diseased heart.
