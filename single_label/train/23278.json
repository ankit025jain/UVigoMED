{"id":23278,"title":"[Different species of human rhinovirus infection in children with acute respiratory tract infections in Beijing].","abstract":"To understand the clinical characteristics of different groups human rhinovirus (HRV)-A, B and C infection in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in Beijing.Respiratory tract specimens (n = 1412) collected from children with ARI during Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2012 were tested for HRV by using semi-nested PCR. Gene fragments of VP4/VP2 capsid protein amplified from HRV positive specimens were sequenced for HRV genotype confirmation. Then epidemiological characteristics of these HRV-positive cases were analyzed.Among these 1412 specimens tested, 103 (7.3%) were HRV positive, including 54 (52.4%) positive for HRV-A, 14 (13.6%) for HRV-B, 35 (34.0%) for HRV-C determined by sequence analysis. The positive rates of HRV-A, B and C (2.5%, 16/638; 0.3%, 2/638 and 1.3%, 8/638) in children with acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI) were lower than those (5.8%, 36/623; 1.8%, 11/623 and 3.9%, 24/623) in children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) (P = 0.003, 0.011, 0.003). In children with LRI, the positive rates of HRV-A, C were similar to each other (P = 0.112), and both were higher than that of HRV-B (P = 0.000, P = 0.026). The severity of ARI among children positive for different groups HRV showed no significant difference evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis H test (Hc = 0.044, P > 0.05), as well as that between children co-infected with HRV and other viruses and those infected with HRV only evaluated by Wilcoxon rank sum test (Zc = 0.872, P > 0.05).HRV is one of important pathogens for children with ARI, especially LRI in Beijing. The positive rates of HRV-A and HRV-C are similar to each other, and both are higher than that of HRV-B. No significant difference was shown among children with different HRV genotypes by evaluation of the severity of ARI, and co-infections of HRV with other viruses do not significantly increase the severity of ARI.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495760","annotations":[{"name":"Rhinovirus","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract infection","weight":0.748874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract","weight":0.710129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.520754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.45632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.355524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.334165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.320833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.150375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
