{"id":77298,"title":"[Present state of occupational hazards in automobile maintenance industry in Beijing, China].","abstract":"To explore the present state of occupational hazards and health status of workers in the automobile maintenance industry.The monitoring results of occupational hazards in 25 automobile maintenance companies, occupational health examination results of 751 male workers in 63 automobile maintenance companies, and physical examination results of 205 male students in one Research Institute were statistically analyzed in 2012.The concentrations of benzene, toluene, xylene, ethyl acetate, and butyl acetate in the workplace were 0.3?21.7, 0.4?40.3, 0.4?84.8, 1.9?34.3, and 0.7?516.7 mg/m(3), respectively; benzene concentration exceeded the upper limit in two workplaces, and butyl acetate concentration exceeded the upper limit in one workplace. The intensity of noise was 70.3? 91.3 dB (A) and exceeded the upper limit in one workplace. The prevalence of blood system involvement in spray painters was 15.6%, significant higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). High-frequency hearing loss was detected in 53.9%of all metalers. Logistic regression analysis indicated that blood system involvement was not correlated with age and working years in spray painters; high-frequency hearing loss in metalers was positively correlated with age, but not correlated with working years.The status of occupational hazards in the automobile maintenance industry should not be neglected, and the management of noxious positions and personal protection should be strengthened in enterprises.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Occupational
