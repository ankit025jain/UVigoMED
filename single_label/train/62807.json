{"id":62807,"title":"MicroRNAs in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: implications for pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.","abstract":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most commonly-occurring type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is considered a curable disease in at least 50% of patients. Considering that the disease represents a heterogeneous group of tumors, recent efforts using gene expression profiling have identified two subgroups, with significantly different response rates to standard immunochemotherapy. Nevertheless, multiple factors in the pathogenesis of this disease remain unclear and continue to be the focus of further research. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The role of microRNAs in cancer initiation and progression has been demonstrated in multiple types of solid cancers and hematological malignancies such as lymphomas. MicroRNAs also have diagnostic potential, and therapeutic of microRNAs targeting is actively pursued. This review provides an overview on the role of microRNAs in the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, their role in molecular pathogenesis and hence their prospective role in implementing novel future treatment options.
