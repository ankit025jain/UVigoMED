{"id":23830,"title":"Variability of the QuantiFERON®-TB gold in-tube test using automated and manual methods.","abstract":"The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by measuring release of interferon gamma (IFN-?) when T-cells (in heparinized whole blood) are stimulated with specific Mtb antigens. The amount of IFN-? is determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Automation of the ELISA method may reduce variability. To assess the impact of ELISA automation, we compared QFT-GIT results and variability when ELISAs were performed manually and with automation.Blood was collected into two sets of QFT-GIT tubes and processed at the same time. For each set, IFN-? was measured in automated and manual ELISAs. Variability in interpretations and IFN-? measurements was assessed between automated (A1 vs. A2) and manual (M1 vs. M2) ELISAs. Variability in IFN-? measurements was also assessed on separate groups stratified by the mean of the four ELISAs.Subjects (N?=?146) had two automated and two manual ELISAs completed. Overall, interpretations were discordant for 16 (11%) subjects. Excluding one subject with indeterminate results, 7 (4.8%) subjects had discordant automated interpretations and 10 (6.9%) subjects had discordant manual interpretations (p?=?0.17). Quantitative variability was not uniform; within-subject variability was greater with higher IFN-? measurements and with manual ELISAs. For subjects with mean TB Responses ±0.25 IU/mL of the 0.35 IU/mL cutoff, the within-subject standard deviation for two manual tests was 0.27 (CI95?=?0.22-0.37) IU/mL vs. 0.09 (CI95?=?0.07-0.12) IU/mL for two automated tests.QFT-GIT ELISA automation may reduce variability near the test cutoff. Methodological differences should be considered when interpreting and using IFN-? release assays (IGRAs).","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466211","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.88354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.739173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.676148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.659079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Interferon-gamma","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-gamma"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.222081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.151073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.122383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.0380956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Set theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory"},{"name":"950","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/950"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Test automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Discordant","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordant"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Metalworking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"M1 motorway","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway"}]}
