{"id":29719,"title":"Society and its influences on drug use among young individuals in Tehran, Iran.","abstract":"Illicit Drug use poses a substantial public health problem around the world, mainly affecting young people. Current estimates suggest that Iran has the highest rate of opium addiction per capita in the world. It has been suggested that multiple elements contribute to the process of drug use. The aim of this study is to explore the probable components in the society that might play a role in the initiation of drug use among young adults. The study is qualitative in nature. Twenty four in-depth interviews were conducted with drug-using young men (n = 10) and women (n = 10) and their family members (n = 4). Based on our data analysis, developing a pro-drug attitude, conformist attitude of society toward treating youth and young individuals, and having weak approach toward prevention were identified as important determinants of substance use. We recommend the need for early intervention, especially for at-risk communities. The results of this research suggest that dealing with a major problem such as drug use needs a comprehensive assessment of the context in which young people live and use substances. According to our findings, exploring young drug users experiences is not only important but also useful for policy makers to develop more effective prevention and intervention programs.
