{"id":29600,"title":"Alcohol use problems in migraine and tension-type headache.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess alcohol use problems in patients with migraine and tension-type headache.We evaluated 81 patients with migraine and 62 patients with tension-type headache. The identification of alcohol consumption problems was carried out with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Alcohol use problem was defined as an AUDIT score of 8 or above. The headache impact was calculated with headache impact test (HIT-6).The proportions of alcohol use problem among patients with migraine and tension-type headache were 5.2% and 16.1%, respectively (P=0.044). The headache impact was significantly higher with migraine than with tension-type headache (P<0.0001). There was an inverse correlation between headache impact and AUDIT (P=0.043).Our results suggest that migraine patients are less prone to alcohol use problems than tension-type headache patients. One of the possible reasons is that migraine is associated with greater impact than tension-type headache.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637978","annotations":[{"name":"Headache","weight":0.122673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_Use_Disorders_Identification_Test"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.0255241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Invertible matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix"},{"name":"Crash test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_test"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"}]}
