{"id":28674,"title":"[The changes in smoking related behaviours and second hand smoke after the smoking ban in Izmir].","abstract":"The aim of the study is to determine the views about law, change of second hand smoke (SHS) quantity, people's smoking related behaviours after the publishment of law which prohibits use of tobacco products in closed public areas.Questionnaire including 47 questions was performed to 600 people, who were selected by Turkey Statistics Instutition to present population of Izmir.53.7% of participants were female and 46.3% was male; the mean age was 41.5 Â± 15.6. 98% of all participants were aware of the law and 91.5% of them were supporting it. 42% of participants who succeeded in quitting had managed it after the ban. Restriction of areas, rise of prices and effects of SHS were the most popular reasons of reducing/quitting smoking after the law. Non-smokers were exposed to SHS at homes; 35.1%, at vehicles: 14.9%, at work places: 14.4%. The number of smoking cigarettes was reduced by 3.19 cigarettes/day. The rate of violation of the ban was 32.3%; only 21.3% of violators were warned. 96.4% of law supporters found law successful and sufficient.A big amount of participants thinks about quitting in Izmir; law is thought to have important effect on this decision. SHS has reduced mostly in public areas with ban, but law must be enlarged to prevent SHS at private areas such as houses, vehicles and workplaces. As a result; the ban encouraged smokers to quit and reduced SHS at public areas. We believe that paying more attention for law sanction and extending the borders of law and reviewing the ban, will make our country more smoke free from now.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814075","annotations":[{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.709789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.683384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.45839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.115793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Smoking ban","weight":0.0945851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_ban"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Passive smoking","weight":0.0627902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking"},{"name":"Ban (law)","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_(law)"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Izmir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izmir"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Fan (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(person)"},{"name":"ADO Den Haag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO_Den_Haag"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Manager (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)"},{"name":"International sanctions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions"},{"name":"Tobacco products","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_products"},{"name":"Political freedom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"List of highest playoff series scoring averages in National Basketball Association history","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_playoff_series_scoring_averages_in_National_Basketball_Association_history"}]}
