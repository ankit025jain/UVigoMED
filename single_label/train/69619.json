{"id":69619,"title":"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and chronic kidney disease: a new cardiorenal risk factor.","abstract":"Clinical and experimental studies revealed that sleep apnea might be an insidious risk factor for the progression of kidney disease and development of cardiovascular events by exacerbating well-known risk factors, namely hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Furthermore, sleep apnea also has a negative impact on endothelial function. Therefore, sleep apnea might be defined as a new cardiorenal risk factor. In this review, we aimed to summarize the evidences supporting the complex inter-relations between sleep apnea and development and progression of chronic kidney disease.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432915","annotations":[{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.381782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.363492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.098008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
