{"id":22356,"title":"Emergence of the European ST80 clone of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a cause of healthcare-associated infections in Eastern Algeria.","abstract":"The authors had for aim to assess whether an in-hospital spread of the European community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) clone was on-going in Annaba, Eastern Algeria.We carried out a molecular epidemiological study of S. aureus strains causing infections in 4 hospitals located in Annaba, between February and October 2010.Our study revealed a very low healthcare-associated MRSA (HCA-MRSA) infection incidence rate of 0.34 per 1000 patient-days. However, the rates of HCA-MRSA strains (85/119) and CA-MRSA (7/29) among S. aureus strains are much higher than those found in France. The European CA-MRSA clone (clonal complex 80, Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec IVc, spa type t044, lukS/F-PV-positive) accounted for 14.1% of all healthcare-associated (HCA) MRSA infections.This study confirmed the emerging role of CA-MRSA as HCA pathogens in North-African Africa.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556453","annotations":[{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.859295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.851375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"France","weight":0.730769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Algeria","weight":0.725454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.680627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.509539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.416564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.299684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.196124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Annaba","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annaba"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Mara language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_language"},{"name":"Hospital Corporation of America","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Corporation_of_America"},{"name":"Spa","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
