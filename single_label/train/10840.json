{"id":10840,"title":"Portal Venous Oxygen Persufflation of the Donation after Cardiac Death pancreas in a rat model is superior to static cold storage and hypothermic machine perfusion.","abstract":"Success of clinical pancreatic islet transplantation depends on the mass of viable islets transplanted and the proportion of transplanted islets that survive early ischaemia reperfusion injury. Novel pancreas preservation techniques to improve islet preservation and viability can increase the utilization of donation after cardiac death donor pancreases for islet transplantation. Rat pancreases were retrieved after 30 min of warm ischaemia and preserved by static cold storage, hypothermic machine perfusion or retrograde portal venous oxygen persufflation for 6 h. They underwent collagenase digestion and density gradient separation to isolate islets. The yield, viability, morphology were compared. In vitro function of isolated islets was compared using glucose stimulated insulin secretion test. Portal venous oxygen persufflation improved the islet yield, viability and morphology as compared to static cold storage. The percentage of pancreases with good in vitro function (stimulation index > 1.0) was also higher after oxygen persufflation as compared to static cold storage. Retrograde portal venous oxygen persufflation of donation after cardiac death donor rat pancreases has the potential to improve islet yield.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628941","annotations":[{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.846652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.735443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.631935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.517232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.376917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Islet cell transplantation","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islet_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.329587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Collagenase","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagenase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.219918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0621111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Machine perfusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perfusion"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"Refrigeration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigeration"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Non-heart-beating donation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-heart-beating_donation"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"}]}
