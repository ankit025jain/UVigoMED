{"id":12827,"title":"Eurycoma longifolia in Radix for the treatment of ethanol-induced gastric lesion in rats.","abstract":"The effect of treatment with Radix on ethanol-induced gastric lesions was investigated. The main ingredient of Radix is Eurycoma longifolia. Twenty-four rats of the Sprague-Dawley species were randomly divided into four groups. Three groups were given 0.5 mL 100% ethanol orally. Another group was used as a control and was given only distilled water orally (control). After 6 h all the rats were fed with normal diet. One group that was administered with ethanol was only given distilled water orally (no treatment). Another two groups that were administered with ethanol were treated with oral Radix 0.128 mg g(-1) b.wt. (Radix) and oral ranitidine 21.4 mg kg(-1) b.wt. (Ranitidine), respectively. After one week, all the rats were fasted overnight and sacrificed. The stomach was isolated and examined for the presence and severity of gastric lesions. Measurements for malondialdehyde content and gastric acid concentration were also done. It is found that the ulcer index was lower in the Radix and ranitidine group compared to the no treatment group whereas in the control group there was no lesion. There was no difference in ulcer index between the Radix and ranitidine group. The gastric MDA content was significantly higher in all the groups that were induced with ethanol compared to the control group but no difference between all the ethanol-induced groups. There was no difference in the gastric acid concentration in all groups. Hence it is concluded that Eurycoma longifolia in Radix is as effective as ranitidine in the treatment of ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506055","annotations":[{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Gastric acid","weight":0.786727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.693799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.675211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.578018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.571203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.51625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.351051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.220123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Ranitidine","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranitidine"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Human sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice"}]}
