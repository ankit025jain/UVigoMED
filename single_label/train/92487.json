{"id":92487,"title":"Treatment for Staphylococcus aureus infection following open wedge high tibial osteotomy using antibiotic-impregnated calcium phosphate cement.","abstract":"This report describes a case of Staphylococcus aureus infection following open wedge high tibial osteotomy, which was successfully treated with by implant removal and replacement with antibiotic-impregnated calcium phosphate cement along with external fixation. The infection occurred 7 months after primary surgery and was treated by implant removal, debridement, external fixation, and application of vancomycin impregnated calcium phosphate cement to fill the defect. Subsequently, the infection resolved completely, and the osteotomy healed with no correction loss. Compared with conventional bone cement, calcium phosphate cement might be an optimal material for certain cases of infection after open wedge high tibial osteotomy because of its higher antibiotic retention, biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and compatibility with heatlabile antibiotics.V.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23462956","annotations":[{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.699676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.665197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.494667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.41286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0425622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0184033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
