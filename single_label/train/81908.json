{"id":81908,"title":"Orthodontic treatment in a periodontal patient with pathologic migration of anterior teeth.","abstract":"A 22-year-old man with severe periodontitis and pathologic tooth migration sought orthodontic treatment. He was treated successfully with effective control of the strength and the direction of the orthodontic forces, and a combination of periodontic and orthodontic treatment. After 22 months of orthodontic treatment, his occlusal trauma resulting from pathologic tooth migration was relieved, a stable occlusion was achieved, and mutual aggravation of occlusal trauma and periodontitis was prevented. Furthermore, the patient's facial esthetics and self-confidence were improved. Newly formed trabecular bone could be seen in the periapical x-rays in some regions where resorption had been severe. This case report shows that resorption of alveolar bone can be prevented and that multidisciplinary orthodontic treatment of a periodontal patient with pathologic tooth migration is effective and helpful.
