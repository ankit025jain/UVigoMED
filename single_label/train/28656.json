{"id":28656,"title":"Relationship between alcohol dependence and the DBI rs2276596 (C/A) polymorphism in Japanese.","abstract":"To facilitate elucidation of the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence, we investigated the relationship between a genetic variant of diazepam biding inhibitor (DBI) C/A polymorphism (rs2276596) and alcohol dependence. We determined the DBI genotypes using a novel method involving PCR-RFLP in healthy controls and alcoholics with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence by ICD-10 (F10.20). There was a significant difference in the rs2276596 polymorphism C/A allele frequency of the DBI gene (P < 0.0001) between alcoholics and healthy controls. The present data suggested that a mutant allele of the DBI was one of the risk factors for alcohol dependence as for the rs2276596 polymorphism.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818357","annotations":[{"name":"Allele","weight":0.863479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Diazepam","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.638961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"ICD-10","weight":0.33096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.123432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}]}
