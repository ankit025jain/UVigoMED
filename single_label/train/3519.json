{"id":3519,"title":"High submuscular placement of urologic prosthetic balloons and reservoirs: 2-year experience and patient-reported outcomes.","abstract":"To present our updated experience and patient-reported outcomes of high submuscular (HSM) placement of urologic prosthetic balloons and reservoirs (UPBRs).A retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent inflatable penile prosthesis and/or artificial urinary sphincter placement between 2011 and 2013. UPBRs were placed in an HSM location between the transversalis fascia and the rectus abdominis muscle by blunt dissection through the external inguinal ring via a trans-scrotal approach. Patient demographics, perioperative outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes were reviewed.During the study period, 146 patients received 158 HSM implants: inflatable penile prosthesis reservoirs (n = 93) or artificial urinary sphincter balloons (n = 65). Patients completed a standardized survey at a mean of 3.2 months (range, 1.1-23.4 months) after surgery and were last followed up at a mean of 5.5 months (range, 1.1-28.7 months). Overall, 94% (n = 149) of UPBRs caused no bother, and patients were satisfied with 96% (n = 151) of implants. Patients were unable to palpate 80% (n = 126) of UPBRs and minimally palpate 16% (n = 26). The primary surgeon was unable to palpate 72% (n = 115) of UPBRs and minimally palpate 20% (n = 31). Type of UPBR, body mass index, reservoir volume, and reservoir manufacturer were not associated with patient or surgeon palpability. Of the 158 UPBRs placed, only 2 (1.3%) were revised due to bothersome patient palpability. No bowel, bladder, ureteral, or vascular injuries occurred.HSM placement of UPBR is safe and feasible, well tolerated, and avoids deep retropubic dissection. Patient-reported outcomes support low palpability, low bother, and high patient satisfaction.","date":"2014-11-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25432851","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.847526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.736059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Penile prosthesis","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_prosthesis"},{"name":"Scrotum","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.721393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Superficial inguinal ring","weight":0.671512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superficial_inguinal_ring"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.665194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.630714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.455557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Inguinal canal","weight":0.390897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_canal"},{"name":"Transversalis fascia","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversalis_fascia"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.241274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.206031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Transversus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
