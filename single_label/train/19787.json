{"id":19787,"title":"Bloodstream infection with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: a case report.","abstract":"IN the presence of septic shock, every hour in delaying the administration of effective antibiotics is associated with a measurable increase in mortality. This is especially true for neutropenic patients with septic shock.1 As there is a higher incidence of involving multi-drug resistant pathogens for neutropenic patients, the decision on antibiotics regime remains a challenge for physicians.2 Immunosuppression and previous antibacterial use are factors that promote the spread of multi-drug resistant pathogens, and the possibility of co-existing multi-drug resistant pathogens should be suspected when treating patients with these risk factors who developed refractory shock. Here we present a case with neutropenic fever and refractory shock whose blood culture yielded multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem- resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.
