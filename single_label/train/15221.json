{"id":15221,"title":"What parents should know while their child is on MDT: insights from a qualitative study in eastern India.","abstract":"In order to provide high quality leprosy services to children affected by leprosy, it is necessary to actively engage parents. A qualitative study was undertaken as part of routine monitoring of field activities in West Bengal, India. A non-probability sample of 20 parents whose child was currently undergoing treatment was interviewed to explore the experiences of parents with regard to the diagnosis of leprosy and the treatment of their child. The most common initial symptom was a white patch and the median duration between recognition of the symptom and care-seeking was 6 months. The most commonly reported side-effect was a black discolouration which had led to non-adherence as well as resulting in school absenteeism. None of the parents had any knowledge of reactions. Although current strategies have enabled early case detection, there are challenges related to ensuring treatment completion. Emphasis should be laid on interpersonal communication to empower parents, enabling them to appreciate the side-effects and recognise the complications early and be actively engaged as a treatment partner while their child is on MDT.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255611","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.584048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"India","weight":0.559575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"West Bengal","weight":0.430089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal"},{"name":"Interpersonal communication","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_communication"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.348449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"School","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.323844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.322908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.291098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Bengal","weight":0.162981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Empowerment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Nonprobability sampling","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprobability_sampling"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Truancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truancy"},{"name":"Bleach","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach"},{"name":"Emphasis/Who Wants to Live Forever","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis/Who_Wants_to_Live_Forever"},{"name":"East India","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India"},{"name":"Absenteeism","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absenteeism"}]}
