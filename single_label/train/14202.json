{"id":14202,"title":"Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal through ventilation of acidified dialysate: an experimental study.","abstract":"Extracorporeal (EC) carbon dioxide (CO(2)) removal (ECCO(2)R) may be a powerful alternative to ventilation, possibly avoiding the need for mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation. We previously reported how an infusion of lactic acid before a membrane lung (ML) effectively enhances ECCO(2)R. We evaluated an innovative ECCO(2)R technique based on ventilation of acidified dialysate.Four swine were sedated, mechanically ventilated, and connected to a venovenous dialysis circuit (blood flow, 250 ml/min). The dialysate was recirculated in a closed loop circuit including a ML (gas flow, 10 liters/min) and then returned to the dialyzer. In each animal, 4 different dialysis flows (DF) of 200, 400, 600, and 800 ml/min were evaluated with and without lactic acid infusion (2.5 mEq/min); the sequence was completed 3 times. At the end of each step, we measured the volume of CO(2)R by the ML (V(co2)ML) and collected blood and dialysate samples for gas analyses.Acid infusion substantially increased V(co2)ML, from 33 ± 6 ml/min to 86 ± 7 ml/min. Different DFs had little effect on V(co2)ML, which was only slightly reduced at DF 200 ml/min. The partial pressure of CO(2) of blood passing through the dialysis filter changed from 60.9 ± 3.6 to 37.1 ± 4.8 mm Hg without acidification and to 32.5 ± 5.3 mm Hg with acidification, corresponding to a pH increase of 0.18 ± 0.03 and 0.03 ± 0.04 units, respectively.Ventilation of acidified dialysate efficiently increased ECCO(2)R of an amount corresponding to 35% to 45% of the total CO(2) production of an adult man from a blood flow as low as 250 ml/min.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439968","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Partial pressure","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.514237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.40668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.37492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.328168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.0331605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Acid rain","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Electrical network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network"},{"name":"European Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Primary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_structure"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
