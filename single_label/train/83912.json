{"id":83912,"title":"[Application of nasal endoscopy in styloid process truncating operation].","abstract":"To investigate the application and the clinical effect of nasal endoscope in styloid process truncating operation.Dividing 66 patients into nasal endoscope group and control group randomly, and then observe them. Nasal endoscope group were cured with nasal endoscope during the styloid process truncating operation and the control group were treated with the routine method of intraoral path. All the operations were executed by the same person. Observation index included the following aspects: the length of the truncated styloid process, the operation time, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative pain and pain degree, inflammatory reaction of raw surface and rehaemorrhagia.Compared with the control group, the length of the truncated styloid process of nasal endoscope group were longer and the operation time had no significant differences. The intraoperative bleeding of intraoperative bleeding group were (85.0 +/- 35.0)ml and in control group were (95.0 +/- 40.0)ml. There are no significant differences between the result. Nasal endoscope group also had the advantages of fewer aches and less inflammatory reaction of raw surface. Both of the team had no rehaemorrhagia.nasal endoscope can truncate a longer styloid process in styloid process truncating operation and is effective to relieve pain, and ease inflammatory reaction, it's a safe mini-trauma operation.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219207","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.507968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.483898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.120095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0224377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Roof","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Leaf shape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_shape"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Truncation (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry)"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Rhinoscope","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoscope"}]}
