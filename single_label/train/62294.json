{"id":62294,"title":"[Relapsed primary intraocular lymphoma treated with intravitreal methotrexate and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue].","abstract":"A 58-year-old woman with primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) of her right eye was treated with combination chemotherapy (methotrexate, procarbazine and vincristine) followed by irradiation to her brain and right eye. However, the disease recurred in the right eye four months later. She was treated with intravitreal injection of methotrexate and high-dose chemotherapy in combination with autologous stem cell transplantation after salvage therapy consisting of cytarabine, etoposide and rituximab. With this treatment strategy, she has been in remission for more than one year with no deterioration of either leukoencephalopathy or cognitive function. Intravitreal injection of methotrexate and high-dose chemotherapy may now be regarded as one of the treatment choices for relapsed PIOL.
