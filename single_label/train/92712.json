{"id":92712,"title":"Headaches as a presenting symptom of linear morphea en coup de sabre.","abstract":"Linear morphea en coup de sabre (ECDS) is a form of localized scleroderma that predominantly affects the pediatric population, with a median age of 10 years at presentation. The existence of neurologic findings in association with ECDS has been well described in the literature. Here we describe 4 patients with ECDS who presented with headaches, which were typical migraines in 3 of the patients. The headaches preceded the onset of cutaneous findings by at least 6 months. Our patients' cases emphasize both the importance of recognizing headaches as a harbinger of ECDS and the necessity of performing thorough cutaneous examination in patients with unexplained headaches or other neurologic disease.
