{"id":78510,"title":"Prospective investigation of nimodipine for acute vocal fold paralysis.","abstract":"Nimodipine has been shown to be beneficial for recovery from acute vocal fold paralysis (AVFP) in an animal model.prospective, open-label trial of patients with AVFP was performed using nimodipine. Consecutive patients were evaluated and offered nimodipine therapy.Fifty-three patients were considered for treatment with nimodipine. Thirteen did not qualify for inclusion, 5 were lost to follow-up, and 7 had side effects requiring cessation of treatment. Thus 28 patients (30 paralyzed vocal folds) were analyzed. Eighteen of the paralyzed vocal folds experienced recovery of purposeful motion (60%). Historical controls and laryngeal electromyography meta-analysis suggest no more than a 20% recovery rate from AVFP.This open label study using nimodipine for treatment of AVFP demonstrates tripling of the recovery rate of vocal fold motion compared with historical controls. Further study in a randomized, controlled manner is warranted.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639294","annotations":[{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.517279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.470281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.445754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.361019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Open-label trial","weight":0.263605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-label_trial"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Nimodipine","weight":0.144746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimodipine"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0788712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Record label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"},{"name":"Fold (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(geology)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
