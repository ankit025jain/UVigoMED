{"id":80107,"title":"[Effect of schistosomiasis control projects in Hexi Reservoir on Oncomelania snail control].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of schistosomiasis control projects in Hexi Reservoir on Oncomelania hupensis snail control.The canal hardening + main water system widening + the overflow dam project, the concrete slope protection, the banking and reclamation + concrete slope protection project, the environment reform project, and the comprehensive treatment were implemented in the tail area, the hydro-fluctuation belt, the rainwater harvesting zoon of the upstream area, the dam area, and the downstream area of the reservoir, respectively. The changes of the snail situation were investigated before and after the construction of the reservoir, and the snail control effects of the schistosomiasis control projects in different parts of the reservoir were analyzed.There were no Oncomelania snails found 3 years in the bottom area, dam area, hydro-fluctuation belt, tail region and downstream of the dam after the construction and storage of the reservoir and the implementation of the schistosomiasis control projects. In the rainwater harvesting zoon of the upstream area, the density of living snails decreased from 0.620 4 snails/0.1 m2 in 2009 to 0.113 2 snails/0.1 m2 in 2013, but the snail area still remained.The schistosomiasis control projects in Hexi Reservoir have effectively prevented the diffusion of Oncomelania snails from the rainwater harvesting zone of the upstream area to the dam area, and they are effective in the snail control.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800568","annotations":[{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.783491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Dam","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam"},{"name":"Rain","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"},{"name":"Concrete","weight":0.64985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.524889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.479736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Rainwater harvesting","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting"},{"name":"Land reclamation","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reclamation"},{"name":"Weir","weight":0.30545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.264474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Slope","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope"},{"name":"Water supply network","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_network"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Bank","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"River source","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_source"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Arithmetic overflow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_overflow"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Tianjin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin"},{"name":"Warehouse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse"},{"name":"Hardening (metallurgy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(metallurgy)"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Stratos Hydroelectric Dam","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratos_Hydroelectric_Dam"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Reform","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
