{"id":58140,"title":"Microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes in preeclamptic and normal placental tissues.","abstract":"To detect the candidate genes for preeclampsia (PE).The gene expression profiles in preeclamptic and normal placental tissues were analyzed using cDNA microarray approach and the altered expression of important genes were further confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) technique. Total RNA was extracted from placental tissues of three cases with severe PE and from three cases with normal pregnancy. After scanning, differentially expressed genes were detected by software.In two experiments (the fluorescent labels were exchanged), a total of 111 differentially expressed genes were detected. In placental tissue ofpreeclamptic pregnancy, 68 differentially expressed genes were up-regulated, and 44 differentially expressed genes were down-regulated. Of these genes, 16 highly differentially expressed genes were confirmed by real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR, and the result showed that the ratio of gene expression differences was comparable to that detected by cDNA microarray.The results of bioinformatic analysis showed that encoding products of differentially expressed genes were correlated to infiltration of placenta trophoblastic cells, immunomodulatory factors, pregnancy-associated plasma protein, signal transduction pathway, and cell adhesion. Further studies on the biological function and regulating mechanism of these genes will provide new clues for better understanding of etiology and pathogenesis of PE.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992773","annotations":[{"name":"Reverse
