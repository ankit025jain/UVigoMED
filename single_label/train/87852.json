{"id":87852,"title":"Evidence-based management of developmental dysplasia of the hip.","abstract":"Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) refers to a spectrum of abnormalities involving the developing hip. These abnormalities range from mild instability to frank dislocation of the joint. It is important to treat the condition effectively in order to encourage the hip to develop normally and produce good long-term results. This article reviews the evidence related to the treatment of DDH. The quality of evidence for DDH management remains low, with little uniformity in terminology and most studies being retrospective in nature. Given this, it is not possible to recommend or reject most treatment modalities based on existing studies.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975762","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.0334927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0149984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Terminology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
