{"id":34762,"title":"Treatment of lipoid proteinosis due to the p.C220G mutation in ECM1, a major allele in Chinese patients.","abstract":"Lipoid proteinosis (LP) is known to be resulted from mutations of the extracellular matrix protein 1 gene (ECM1). However, no effective or sustained therapeutic methods to alleviate LP symptoms have been reported.Here, we report a 12-year-old boy with LP and recurrent anaphylaxis. The laboratory and histopathological investigations were adopted to confirm the diagnosis, and gene sequencing was performed. We treated this patient with glucocorticoid for three years to relieve the patient's lipid metabolism disorder and symptoms related to LP and anaphylaxis.The Laboratory and histopathological investigations showed a lipid metabolism disorder and anaphylaxis in the patient. A homozygous missense mutation p.C220G of ECM1 was identified by Sanger sequencing, which is a major allele in Chinese patients with LP. Notably, after three years' treatment, the symptoms such as skin lesions, stiff oral mucosa and hoarse voice in the patient were significantly relieved or recovered.Our report may provide a potentially effective therapeutic approach for the first time to other LP patients who are experiencing recurrent anaphylaxis and/or chronic inflammation.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708644","annotations":[{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.927252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.843792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.839839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.796025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.559309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.356462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"China","weight":0.1621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Lipoid proteinosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoid_proteinosis"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Frederick Sanger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
