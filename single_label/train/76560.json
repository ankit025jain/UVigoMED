{"id":76560,"title":"[Nutrition and chronic wound healing. A clinical case of a patient with a hard to heal venous leg ulcers].","abstract":"The cronicity of a wound can be produced by the alteration of several factors. One of the agents that can produce a delay in the wound healing process is malnutrition. According with the evidence, nutrition is an important factor in chronic wound prevention and treatment. The prevalence of low extremity wounds increases in population aged 65 or more. As we became older, malnutrition risk is more relevant due to physiological changes related to ageing. We describe a clinical case of a torpid venous leg ulcer in an elder patient centering on nutrition assessment and management.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984303","annotations":[{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.655405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.550962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.464612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.239066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.233715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Chronic wound","weight":0.208635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wound"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.150053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Venous ulcer","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_ulcer"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"}]}
