{"id":71341,"title":"Paraganglioma of the carotid body: case report.","abstract":"With an incidence of 0.03% of all tumors, carotid body tumors (CBTs) are extremely rare. We present the case of a 63 year old female patient with an asymptomatic right sided neck mass of 3 cm diameter. Doppler ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT confirmed the clinical suspicion of carotid body tumor. The patient underwent complete surgical excision of the Shamblin group II tumor and an adjacent lymph node, without preoperative embolization. The histopathological examination diagnosed a benign CBT. There were no postoperative complications at 1 and 6 months follow-ups.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076709","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Paraganglioma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraganglioma"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.825648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.671591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.602375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Carotid body","weight":0.115812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_body"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
