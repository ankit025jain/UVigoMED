{"id":77419,"title":"[Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: priority to prevention and coordination of the interventions].","abstract":"Upper-limb musculoskeletal disorders (UL-MSDs) are painful conditions related to the overuse of periarticular soft tissues. The main UL-MSDs are rotator cuff tendinopathy, epicondylalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome and non-specific pain UL-MSDs are multifactorial disorders associated with individual and occupational (biomechanical, psychosocial and factors related to work organization) risk factors. Treatments are based on a global assessment of the clinical, social and occupational situations in order to identify cases of good prognosis and those, ess frequent, at high risk of prolonged work disability. The management of complex cases needs a close cooperation, with the agreement of the patient/worker, between the general practtioner and the occupational physician. One or more return to work visits are needed to help workers to keep their job. The prevention of UL-MSDs requires a global and integrated approach focusing on the reduction of the exposure to working constraints, early diagnosis and management and, if necessary, an intervention of stay at work. The new compensation procedures for UL-MSDs are described.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Occupational
