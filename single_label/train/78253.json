{"id":78253,"title":"Stress and anxiety effects on positive skin test responses in young adults with allergic rhinitis.","abstract":"Anxiety and psychological stress affect allergy-related immune function. How these relations influence the evaluations of patients with allergic rhinitis is unknown.To examine whether anxiety and stress exposure affect skin prick test (SPT) responses to common allergens for which patients with atopy showed no prior positive SPT response.Patients with allergic rhinitis, evidenced by clinical history and SPT results, were admitted twice to a hospital research unit for 4 hours. In a crossover design, SPT wheals were assessed before and after the Trier Social Stress Test and then the following morning; for comparison, SPT wheals were assessed before and after a laboratory session without a stressor. Analyses focused on wheal responses for common allergens that tested negative (wheal size <3 mm larger than saline) from SPTs performed at multiple baseline assessments.After the Trier Social Stress Test, more anxious patients with atopy had a higher incidence of positive SPT reactions to antigens that previously tested negative. Anxiety was unrelated to positive SPT incidence under nonstressful conditions. Based on clinical symptom reports, newly positive SPT reactions after the stressor were apparently corrections of previously false-negative SPT reactions. The SPT wheal responses for allergens previously testing negative were enhanced after a stressor. Histamine (positive control) or saline (negative control) SPT responses were not affected.A laboratory stressor affected allergen SPT responses in more anxious patients with allergic rhinitis. In addition to clinical history, assessment of anxiety and current stress at the time of the SPT may provide valuable information about a patient's allergic status and aid in clinical decision making.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726195","annotations":[{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.883109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.664199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.479782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.337674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.238717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.217447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.146605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.0627764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
