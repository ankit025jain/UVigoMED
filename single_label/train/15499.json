{"id":15499,"title":"Rifampicin resistance mutations in the 81 bp RRDR of rpoB gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates using Xpert® MTB/RIF in Kampala, Uganda: a retrospective study.","abstract":"Introduction of Xpert® MTB/RIF assay has revolutionalised the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) by simultaneously detecting the bacteria and resistance to rifampicin (rif), a surrogate marker for multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) as well as one of the principal first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. In general, rpoB mutations can be found in 96.1% of rif-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains worldwide and these mutations usually are located in a region at the 507-533rd amino acid residuals (81 bp) in the MTB rpoB gene, which is referred to as Rifampicin-resistance-determining region (RRDR). In this study, we determined the frequency of MDR-TB in Kampala using Xpert® MTB/RIF in comparison with the agar proportion method using Middlebrook 7H11and further determined the frequency of probes for different rpoB gene mutations using Xpert® MTB/RIF assay in the 81 bp RRDR.A total of 1501 specimens received at Mycobacteriology laboratory, Makerere University for Xpert testing between May 2011 and May 2014 were analysed by Xpert® MTB/RIF assay. Specimens that were positive for both MTB and rifampicin resistance were further subjected to a complete first line anti-mycobacterial drug susceptibility testing using Middlebrook 7H11 agar proportion method (APM).Xpert® MTB/RIF assay detected 313 MTB positive specimens and out of which 12 specimens had both MTB and rifampicin- resistance conferred by four different rpoB gene mutations in the 81 bp-RRDR of MTB, further one (1/12), specimen was found to be rifampicin mono-resistant on APM while the 11 were found to be MDR-TB. Probes associated with the observed rif- resistance were as follows: E (7/12), B (3/12), A (1/12), D (1/12) and no rif-resistance was associated with probe C. No specimen yielded rif-resistance associated with more than one probe failure (mutation combinations). Probe D was associated with rifampicin mono-resistant.MDR-TB was at 3.5% in the studied population. Mutations associated with Probe E (58%) also known as codons 531and 533 are the commonest rpoB gene mutation identified by Xpert® MTB/RIF assay in this setting and mutations identified by probe E of the assay, turned out to be MDR-TB strains by agar proportion method antimicrobial susceptibility testing. No mutation was detected in the codon 522.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25190040","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.734643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.723556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.575385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.536631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Uganda","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.2563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.176375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0697704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Kampala","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampala"},{"name":"RpoB","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RpoB"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Antimycobacterial","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimycobacterial"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
