{"id":39665,"title":"Accumulation of (18)F-FDG in the liver in hepatic steatosis.","abstract":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with hepatic inflammation. An emerging technique to image inflammation is PET using the glucose tracer, (18)F-FDG. The purpose of this study was to determine whether in hepatic steatosis the liver accumulates FDG in excess of FDG physiologically exchanging between blood and hepatocyte.Hepatic FDG uptake, as SUV = [voxel counts / administered activity] Ã— body weight), and CT density were measured in a liver region in images obtained 60 minutes after injection of FDG in 304 patients referred for routine PET/CT. Maximum SUV (region voxel with the highest count rate, SUVmax) and average SUV ( SUVave) were measured. Blood FDG concentration was measured as the maximum SUV over the left ventricular cavity (SUVLV). SUVave was adjusted for hepatic fat using a formula equating percentage fat to CT density. Patients were divided in subgroups on the basis of blood glucose (< 4, 4 to < 5, 5 to < 6, 6 to < 8, 8 to < 10, and > 10 mmol/L). Hepatic steatosis was defined as CT density less than 40 HU (n = 71).The percentage of hepatic fat increased exponentially with blood glucose. SUVmax / SUVLV and fat-adjusted SUVave / SUVLV but not SUVave / SUVLV correlated with blood glucose. Fat-adjusted SUVave was higher in patients with hepatic steatosis (p < 0.001) by ~0.4 in all blood glucose groups. There was a similar difference (~0.3) in SUVmax (p < 0.005) but no difference in SUVave. SUVmax / SUVLV and fat-adjusted SUVave / SUVLV correlated with blood glucose in patients with hepatic steatosis but not in those without. SUVave / SUVLV correlated with blood glucose in neither group.FDG uptake is increased in hepatic steatosis, probably resulting from irreversible uptake in inflammatory cells superimposed on reversible hepatocyte uptake.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148170","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.848007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.698227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.434085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.423039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.410378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.276491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.276029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.215536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.163079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0961829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Voxel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"}]}
