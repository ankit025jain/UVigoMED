{"id":50340,"title":"Effectiveness of a training course for general practice nurses in motivation support in type 2 diabetes care: a cluster-randomised trial.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes is a common metabolic disease with the potential for prevention of complications. The prevention requires a high level of lasting actions from the patients, which may be burdensome. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a training course for general practice nurses in motivation support at 18 months follow-up in the affiliated type 2 diabetes population.Forty general practices with nurse-led diabetes consultations from the area of Aarhus, Denmark were randomised 1?1 to either intervention or usual practice. Intervention practices were offered a 16-hour Self-determination theory-based course including communication training for general practice nurses delivered over 10 months. The affiliated diabetes populations (aged 40-74 years) were identified from registers (intervention n?=?2,005; usual n?=?2,029). Primary outcomes were register-based glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) -, total cholesterol levels, and well-being measured by the Problem Areas In Diabetes scale (PAID) and the mental component summary score, SF12 (SF12, mcs). Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Predefined subgroups analyses were performed.The differences between the intervention- and the control practices' mean HbA1c and total cholesterol at follow-up adjusted for baseline values and clustering were respectively: -0.02%-points (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.07; p: 0.67); 0.08 mmol/l (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.15; p: 0.02). Differences in median scores adjusted for clustering were for PAID: 1.25; p?=?0.31 and SF12, mcs: 0.99; p?=?0.15. Women in intervention practices differed from women in usual practices on mean HbA1c: -0.12%-points (-0.23 to -0.02; p?=?0.02) and SF12, mcs: 2.6; p?=?0.01.Offering a training course for general practice nurses in applying the Self-determination theory in current type 2 diabetes care had no effect compared with usual practice measured by HbA1c and total cholesterol levels and the well-being at 18 months of follow-up in a comprehensive register-based diabetes population. Subgroup analyses suggested a possible effect in women, which deserves further attention.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798419","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.829067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.817003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.678995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.652616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.650072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.458106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.376724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.304081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Aarhus","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarhus"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Register (sociolinguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Ticket to Ride (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_to_Ride_(album)"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
