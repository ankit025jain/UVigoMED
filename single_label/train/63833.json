{"id":63833,"title":"[A case of advanced gastric cancer with carcinomatous lymphangitis of the lung treated with docetaxel and S-1 combination chemotherapy].","abstract":"A 67-year-old woman with complaints of cough and dyspnea was admitted; her chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed pulmonary carcinomatous lymphangitis. Endoscopic examination revealed advanced gastric cancer and the patient was treated with a combination of 40 mg/m2 docetaxel, administered on day 1, and S-1 100 mg/body/day, administered for 14 days followed by a 7-day interval, as 1 course despite her performance status( PS) being grade 3. After 2 courses of chemotherapy, CT showed that the carcinomatous lymphangitis had improved, and the patient was discharged with PS of grade 0. We report that combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and S-1 might be effective for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer with carcinomatous lymphangitis of the lung in patients with a poor systemic condition.
