{"id":85599,"title":"Pharmacogenetic analysis of GLCCI1 in three north European pediatric asthma populations with a reported use of inhaled corticosteroids.","abstract":"GLCCI1 rs37972 has previously been associated with decreased lung function improvement upon treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in asthmatics.To assess whether variation in rs37972 is associated with altered ICS efficacy in north European asthmatic children and young adults with a reported use of ICS.rs37972 was genotyped in three cohort studies of asthmatic children with a reported use of ICS. As an indicator for asthma exacerbations, asthma-related hospital visits and oral corticosteroid use were studied. Asthma control was assessed using a questionnaire.rs37972 T allele was not significantly associated with an increased risk of oral corticosteroid use (summary odds ratio: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.99-1.45), an increased risk of asthma-related hospital visits (summary odds ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.89-1.29), uncontrolled symptoms (summary odds ratio: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.75-1.36) or higher ICS dosages (summary ?: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.06-0.08).Variation in GLCCI1 rs37972 genotype does not seem to affect ICS efficacy in north European asthmatic children.
