{"id":80026,"title":"[Prevalence and control of schistosomiasis in Jiangxi Province during 2002-2012].","abstract":"To analyze the status of prevalence and control of schistosomiasis in Jiangxi Province from 2002 to 2012.Endemic status and control effectiveness during the period from 2002 to 2012 was analyzed by using a combination of field survey, data collection and retrospective investigation.From 2002 to 2012, schistosomiasis control made significant achievements in Jiangxi Province. The number of counties which have reached the criteria of transmission interruption of schistosomiasis increased from 19 in 2002 to 22 in 2012. The number of patients with schistosome infection decreased from 128 331 in 2002 to 73 102 in 2012. The positive rate of serological test and fecal examination in residents decreased from 12.2% and 4.2% in 2002 to 5.2% and 0.4% in 2012, respectively. Acute infection reduced from 146 cases in 2002 to 3 cases in 2012, but advanced cases increased by 42.4%. The positive rate of fecal examination in cattle reduced from 4.7% in 2002 to 1.3% in 2012. The density of living snails and infected snails significantly decreased to 0.083 5/0.1 a? and 0.000 037/0.1 m2 in 2012, respectively. However, the snail-ridden areas slightly increased. Jiangxi Province reached the criteria of endemic control for schistosomiasis in 2008. During 2002-2012, control activities were intensified. Examination and chemotherapy for human increased by 65.2% and 65.5%, while 23.4% and 251.1% for cattle. Mean while, area with snail control activities increased by 617.8%. An integrated strategy of infection source control was implemented in the Province.During 2002 to 2012, endemic index of schistosomiasis in Jiangxi showed a steady decline after 2005. Currently, schistosomiasis prevalence shows a low level. The endemic indicators of infection in human and livestock as well as Oncomelania snails have been kept stable at low level.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818413","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.925623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.803216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.52602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.497848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Revision control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"},{"name":"Jiangxi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"331","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/331"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Archaeological field survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_field_survey"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"List of counties in Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Texas"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
