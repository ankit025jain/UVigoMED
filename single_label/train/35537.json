{"id":35537,"title":"[Neurodevelopmental outcome of very premature infants].","abstract":"Very preterm infants are at risk of neurodevelopmental impairments, which may affect motor development, intelligence and behavior. Neurodevelopmental follow-up is offered to these children who represent 1% of Swiss births, and may show abnormal motor tone, which sometimes resolves spontaneously or evolves in cerebral palsy. Standardized tests explore intellectual functioning and may allow the diagnosis of specific learning impediments. Finally, behavior is assessed with standardized questionnaires which can reveal hyperactivity with or without attention deficit, impaired social relations, psychiatric troubles or autism, all more frequent amongst preterm children.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640281","annotations":[{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.719464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Cerebral palsy","weight":0.69853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.615836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.522886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.434199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.328475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.326518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.217581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"ADHD predominantly inattentive","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD_predominantly_inattentive"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
