{"id":24639,"title":"[Effects of different anesthesia methods on perioperative hemodynamics and ECG in old CHD patients].","abstract":"To explore an optimal anesthesia method with less impact on hemodynamics and electrocardiogram (ECG) of old patients with coronary artery disease (CHD) during abdominal operation.The 133 CHD patients waiting for abdominal operation were randomly divided into continuous epidural anesthesia (EA) group, general anesthesia group (GA) and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) group. Continuous monitoring was carried out during operation and mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SaO2), abnormal ECG were measured respectively at different time for comparison and the differences of the above hemodynamic parameters and abnormal ECG features were compared among the 3 groups.At the 15 min and 30 min point after anesthesia, SaO2 in GA group was significantly increased compared to that in the EA group (P < 0.05). At 15 min, 30 min and 60 min point after anesthesia, MAP in CSEA group was significantly increased compared to that in the EA group (P < 0.05). At 30 min point after anesthesia, HR in CSEA group was increased significantly compared to the EA group (P < 0.05). At 15 min and 30 min point after anesthesia, SaO2 in the CSEA group was increased significantly compare to the EA group (P < 0.05). Compared with preanesthesia (T0) in EA group, MAP, HR and SaO2 decreased significantly at 15, 30 and 60 min after anesthesia (P < 0.05). The fluctuation of the three parameters in GA and CSEA groups were relatively small (P > 0.05). As well as the comparison of abnormal ECG among the 3 groups was concerned, the incidence of ST-T changes in GA and CSEA groups were significantly lower than that in EA group at the time of 15 min, 30 min and 60 min after anesthesia and at the time of surgery termination (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The incidence of arrhythmia in GA and CSEA groups were significantly lower than that in EA group at the time of 15 min, 30 min and 60 min after anesthesia (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with T0 in the same group, the incidences of ST-T changes and arrhythmia in GA or CSEA group at the time of 15, 30 and 60 min after anesthesia and at the time of surgery termination were significantly lower than that before anesthesia (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).GA and CSEA have less impact on hemodynamics and have smaller incidence of abnormal ECG of old CHD patients with abdominal operation.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330671","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.800536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Mean arterial pressure","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_arterial_pressure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.48003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"}]}
