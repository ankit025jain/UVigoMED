{"id":56696,"title":"National women's knowledge of stroke warning signs, overall and by race/ethnic group.","abstract":"Recognition of stroke warning signs may reduce treatment delays. The purpose of this study was to evaluate contemporary knowledge of stroke warning signs and knowledge to call 9-1-1, among a nationally representative sample of women, overall and by race/ethnic group.A study of cardiovascular disease awareness was conducted by the American Heart Association in 2012 among English-speaking US women ?25 years identified through random-digit dialing (n=1205; 54% white, 17% black, 17% Hispanic, and 12% other). Knowledge of stroke warning signs, and what to do first if experiencing stroke warning signs, was assessed by standardized open-ended questions.Half of women surveyed (51%) identified sudden weakness/numbness of face/limb on one side as a stroke warning sign; this did not vary by race/ethnic group. Loss of/trouble talking/understanding speech was identified by 44% of women, more frequently among white versus Hispanic women (48% versus 36%; P<0.05). Fewer than 1 in 4 women identified sudden severe headache (23%), unexplained dizziness (20%), or sudden dimness/loss of vision (18%) as warning signs, and 1 in 5 (20%) did not know 1 stroke warning sign. The majority of women said that they would call 9-1-1 first if they thought they were experiencing signs of a stroke (84%), and this did not vary among black (86%), Hispanic (79%), or white/other (85%) women.Knowledge of stroke warning signs was low among a nationally representative sample of women, especially among Hispanics. In contrast, knowledge to call 9-1-1 when experiencing signs of stroke was high.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646615","annotations":[{"name":"American Heart Association","weight":0.789357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.664129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.526857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.522689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.511358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.48362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.457037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.226923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.161849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0547444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"1205","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1205"},{"name":"9-1-1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1"},{"name":"Warning sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_sign"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Dialling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialling"},{"name":"American Heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart"},{"name":"2012 (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_(film)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
