{"id":30831,"title":"Successful treatment of severe carbamazepine toxicity with 5% albumin-enhanced continuous venovenous hemodialysis.","abstract":"Carbamazepine overdose is a common, toxic ingestion, manifesting as central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression. Carbamazepine is highly protein bound with a large volume of distribution and, therefore, inefficiently removed by conventional hemodialysis. We describe the successful use of continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) with 5% albumin enhanced dialysate in a 31-year-old female who developed CNS depression, hypotension and respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, after an intentional ingestion of approximately 10 g of extended release carbamazepine, Tegretol CR(®). The peak drug level was 26 mcg/ml, therapeutic range 8-12 mcg/ml, with toxicity often developing a level above 15 mcg/ml. Normal half-life of drug elimination is 35-60 h in carbamazepine naïve patients. In contrast, with albumin-enhanced dialysis, we observed a drug half-life of 18 h. She was extubated on day two and was transferred to inpatient psychiatry by day 3 without significant neurologic sequelae. In vitro studies have been done with bovine blood demonstrating significant carbamazepine removal using CVVHD with albumin-enhanced dialysate. There has been very limited experience using albumin-enhanced CVVHD in an adult patient with carbamazepine toxicity.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449266","annotations":[{"name":"Carbamazepine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine"},{"name":"Hypoventilation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoventilation"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.861668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.811578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.794971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.584106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Volume of distribution","weight":0.495147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_distribution"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.423922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Central nervous system depression","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system_depression"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.246925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.234319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Plasma protein binding","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_protein_binding"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Distribution (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)"}]}
