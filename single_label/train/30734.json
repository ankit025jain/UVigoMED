{"id":30734,"title":"[Deep brain stimulation for addiction, anorexia and compulsion. Rationale, clinical results and ethical implications].","abstract":"As an established treatment for movement disorders, the application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for psychiatric indications has been investigated for almost 15 years. A CE label (also FDA approval) has recently been obtained for treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).This article aims at illustrating the current state of DBS in the treatment of refractory OCD. In addition, initial experimental approaches to investigate the potential use of DBS in substance addiction and anorexia nervosa (AN) will also be outlined as both disorders share some common features with OCD.The present review is based on a keyword literature search (PubMed) while taking into account relevant references and own investigationsAlthough the number of clinical trials for treatment of refractory OCD is limited and sample sizes are small, there is some evidence for a substantial improvement, a so-called full response of OCD symptoms under DBS. However, not all patients benefit from the intervention. Regarding substance addiction and AN, data are scarce and are only indicative of a potential benefit at most.Present data regarding the clinical benefits of DBS in OCD are encouraging and open up new avenues for the treatment of therapy refractory patients. However, several aspects, such as mechanisms of action, predictors and long-term side effect profiles, are incomplete or even unknown. In the case of addiction and AN, DBS remains purely experimental, at least for the moment. Hence, clinical trials should remain the gold standard for all three indications.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463647","annotations":[{"name":"Deep brain stimulation","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Anorexia nervosa","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.773266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.752981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Movement disorder","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.515945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"OCD","weight":0.489595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCD"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.420288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.302835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.205851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Compulsive behavior","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_behavior"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"European Economic Community","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Record label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"}]}
