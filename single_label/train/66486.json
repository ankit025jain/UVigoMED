{"id":66486,"title":"Evaluation of efficacy of natural astaxanthin and vitamin E in prevention of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity in the rat model.","abstract":"We evaluated the effect of astaxanthin (ASX) and vitamin E (vit E) on colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) induced-nephrotoxicity in rats.Animals were treated with sterile saline, 300000 or 450 000 IU/kg/day of CMS, CMS + ASX (20 mg/kg), CMS + vit E (100 mg/kg), or CMS + 1 ml/kg olive oil (OO) for 7 days. The plasma/urine creatinine (Cr) level, urine ?-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) level, and renal tissue activities in malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reductase (GSH), as well as renal histology were performed.CMS induced a tubular damage, increased the GGT and MDA levels, and decreased the activities of SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH. Co-treatment with ASX or vit E restored all biochemical parameters cited above and improved the histopathological damage.Nephrotoxicity induced by CMS might be due to oxidative damage. The improvement by ASX or vit E seems to be related to their antioxidant properties.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709323","annotations":[{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.863267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.737788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.680167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chromium","weight":0.660458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"},{"name":"Olive oil","weight":0.654509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.597618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.334742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.249696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase","weight":0.231211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-glutamyl_transpeptidase"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Colistin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin"},{"name":"Astaxanthin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astaxanthin"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.0193731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Olive","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive"}]}
