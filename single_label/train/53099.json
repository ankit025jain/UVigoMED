{"id":53099,"title":"The pituitary stalk effect: is it a passing phenomenon?","abstract":"Most patients with large pituitary tumors do not exhibit hyperprolactinemia as a result of pituitary lactotroph disinhibition (stalk effect). Studies have demonstrated that increased intrasellar pressure is associated with both \"stalk effect\" hyperprolactinemia and pituitary insufficiency. Our primary hypothesis was that, despite continued disinhibition, lactotroph failure is responsible for normoprolactinemia in patients with large macroadenomas. As a corollary, we proposed that the hyperprolactinemia phase, which presumably would precede the insufficiency/normoprolactinemic state, would more likely be discovered in premenopausal females and go unnoticed in males. Prospective, consecutive surgical series of 98 patients of clinically nonfunctional pituitary adenomas. Lactotroph insufficiency was inferred by the coexistence of insufficiency in another pituitary axis. The existence of pre-operative lactotroph disinhibition was inferred based on comparison of pre- versus post-operative prolactin levels. 87 % of patients with tumor size >20 mm and normoprolactinemia had pituitary insufficiency. Pre-operative prolactin in patients with pituitary insufficiency were lower than those with intact pituitary function. Prolactin levels dropped in nearly all patients, including patients with normoprolactinemia pre-operatively. Premenopausal women had smaller tumors and higher pre-operative prolactin levels compared to males. No premenopausal female exhibited evidence of pituitary insufficiency. Our study provides suggestive evidence that the \"stalk effect\" pathophysiology is the norm rather than the exception, and that the finding of normoprolactinemia in a patient with a large macroadenoma is likely a consequence of lactotroph insufficiency. In males, the hyperprolactinemia window is more likely to be missed clinically due to an absence of prolactin-related symptoms.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549751","annotations":[{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.294432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Hyperprolactinaemia","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperprolactinaemia"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Hypopituitarism","weight":0.0703369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopituitarism"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Prolactin cell","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin_cell"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Disinhibition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinhibition"},{"name":"Pituitary stalk","weight":0.0294679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_stalk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"20 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Rotation around a fixed axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Premenopausal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenopausal"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Corollary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Peaceful coexistence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_coexistence"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Stalking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking"}]}
