{"id":61190,"title":"[The role of endogenous vascular elastase in coronary artery reconstruction in Kawasaki disease].","abstract":"To investigate the role of endogenous vascular elastase (EVE) in coronary artery between reconstruction among pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease (KD).Sixty children who were diagnosed with KD between January 2012 and April 2013 were selected as the case group, and peripheral venous blood samples were collected on days 0-11 (pathological stage I) and days 12-25 (pathological stage II) after the onset of disease; another 60 children without KD who visited the hospital due to acute fever during the same period were selected as the control group, and fasting peripheral venous blood samples were collected in the acute stage of fever. For both groups, serum levels of EVE and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For the case group, ultrasonic cardiography was used to detect coronary artery lesions (CALs) at the first, second and fourth weekends. The correlations of EVE level with IL-6 and VEGF levels were evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis.Serum levels of EVE and IL-6 in the case group in pathological stages I and II were significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05), but plasma VEGF levels in stages I and II were significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05); in the case group, EVE and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in stage II than in stage I (P<0.05). In pathological stage II, KD patients with CALs had significantly higher serum levels of EVE and IL-6 but significantly lower plasma VEGF levels compared with those without CALs (P<0.05); KD patients with coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) had significantly higher serum levels of EVE and IL-6 but significantly lower plasma VEGF level compared with those without CAAs (P<0.05 for all). EVE level was positively correlated with IL-6 level (r=0.915, P<0.05), yet negatively correlated with VEGF level (r=-0.769, P<0.05).EVE may participate in coronary artery reconstruction in children with KD. To interfere EVE activity may reduce and prevent CALs.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750836","annotations":[{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Kawasaki disease","weight":0.836937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.575314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Elastase","weight":0.514291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastase"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.41924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.335094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.180833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0694895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.06086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.0479663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"}]}
