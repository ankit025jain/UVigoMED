{"id":52416,"title":"Use of natural compounds in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.","abstract":"Nephropathy, retinopathy cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy are all recognized as important complications in about 50% of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, mostly related to a poor glycemic control or to an improper management of this pathology. In any case, amongst others, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) seems the leading and most painful complication usually affecting many DM patients. For this reason, this work was conceived to review the large variety of strategies adopted for management of DPN, starting from the most conventional therapies to arrive at alternative approaches. From this perspective, both the most popular pharmacological treatments used to respond to the poorly effect of common analgesics--non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and opioids--understood as gabapentin vs. pregabalin clinical use, and the guidelines provided by Oriental Medicine as well as by a long list of natural compounds that many authors identify as possible therapeutic or alternative agents to replace or to combine with the existing therapies will be included. Moreover, in the effort to provide the widest panel of remedies, the most antique techniques of acupuncture and electrostimulation will be considered as alternative, which are useful approaches to take into account in any non-pharmacological strategy for DPN management.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603557","annotations":[{"name":"Gabapentin","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Pregabalin","weight":0.832147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.827032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.744858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.645947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Electrotherapy","weight":0.585559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrotherapy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.491951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.454849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.387909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.27114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.107057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0199942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}]}
