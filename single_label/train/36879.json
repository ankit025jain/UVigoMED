{"id":36879,"title":"Anatomical characteristics of the thoracic aortic arch in an Asian population.","abstract":"Endovascular repair of the aortic arch is often unsatisfactory due to poor stent-vessel conformity and inadequate landing zones.To study the anatomical characteristics of the aortic arch and provide basic information for the development of arch-specific endovascular devices.Three-dimensional models were reconstructed in Mimics (image segmentation software) from computed tomography aortograms of 120 elderly Asian patients, by manual segmentation. The centerline of each Three-dimensional aortic model was calculated using a repulsive force field method. Measurements of the aorta and supra-aortic branches were analyzed using Patran (finite-element software). A three-dimensional statistical aortic arch model was built using principal component analysis.The mean diameters of the ascending and descending aorta, and the origins of the innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian artery were 39.4?±?6.7, 34.5?±?7.9, 18.0?±?3.8, 12.6?±?2.7, and 14.1?±?2.5?mm, respectively. The length of the ascending aorta, innominate to left common carotid artery, and left common carotid to left subclavian artery were 62.6?±?11.4, 12.0?±?5.6, and 18.7?±?5.6?mm along the centerline. The mean angle of curvature was 103.8?±?25 degrees. Principal component analysis of the three-dimensional centerlines derived 3 main modes of variation, which account for 61% of the overall shape range.Aortic arch anatomical information from an elderly Asian population can be useful for the development of future endovascular devices.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532612","annotations":[{"name":"Subclavian artery","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_artery"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.844425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.802204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.766336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Brachiocephalic artery","weight":0.427802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_artery"},{"name":"Descending aorta","weight":0.266689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_aorta"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Segmentation (image processing)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"}]}
