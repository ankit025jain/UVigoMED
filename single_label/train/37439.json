{"id":37439,"title":"Risk of placental dysfunction disorders after prior miscarriages: a population-based study.","abstract":"The objective of the investigation was to study the association between prior miscarriages and the risks of placental dysfunction disorders, including preeclampsia, stillbirth, birth of a small for gestational age (SGA) infant, placental abruption, and spontaneous preterm birth.In a population-based cohort study including 619,587 primiparous women, we estimated risks of placental dysfunction disorders for women with 1 (n = 68,185), 2 (n = 11,410) and 3 or more (n = 3823) self-reported prior miscarriages. Risks were calculated as odds ratios by unconditional logistic regression analysis and adjustments were made for maternal age, early pregnancy body mass index, height, smoking habits, country of birth, years of formal education, in vitro fertilization, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, hypothyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosis, fetal sex, and year of childbirth.Compared with women with no prior miscarriage, women with 1 prior miscarriage had almost no increased risks. Women with 2 prior miscarriages had increased risks of spontaneous preterm birth, preterm (<37 weeks) SGA infant, and placental abruption. The rates of all disorders were higher for women with 3 or more prior miscarriages compared with women without prior miscarriages: preeclampsia, 5.83% vs 4.27%; stillbirth, 0.69% vs 0.33%, SGA infant, 5.09% vs 3.22%, placental abruption, 0.81% vs 0.41%; and spontaneous preterm birth, 6.45% vs 4.40%. The adjusted odds ratios for preterm (<37 weeks) disorders in women with 3 prior miscarriages were approximately 2.History of 2 or more miscarriages is associated with an increased risk of placental dysfunction disorders and should be regarded as a risk factor in antenatal care.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
