{"id":90205,"title":"[Effectiveness comparison between absorbable and metallic screws for treatment of tibiofibular syndesmotic disruptions].","abstract":"To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of absorbable screws for the treatment of tibiofibular syndesmotic disruptions by comparing with metallic screws.Between July 2007 and May 2012, 69 patients with tibiofibular syndesmotic disruptions associated with ankle fractures were treated; absorbable screw fixation was used in 38 cases (group A) and metallic screw fixation was used in 31 cases (group B). There was no significant difference in gender, age, injury causes, the type of fracture, the side of fracture, and disease duration between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The fracture healing time, weight bearing time, and complications were recorded and compared between 2 groups. According to Baird-Jackson scoring system, the function of the ankle was assessed after 6 months.Infection of incision occurred in 3 cases (7.9%) of group A and 2 cases (6.5%) of group B, and skin necrosis of incision in 1 case (2.6%) of group A and 5 cases (16.1%) of group B, showing no significant difference in the incidences of infection and necrosis of incisions between 2 groups (P > 0.05); primary healing of incision was obtained in the other patients. The 69 cases were followed up 12-26 months (mean, 18.6 months). The weight bearing time was (2.47 +/- 0.59) months in group A and was (3.16 +/- 0.74) months in group B, showing no significant difference (t=1.175, P=0.244). X-ray films showed that fractures and tibiofibular syndesmotic disruptions healed in 2 groups; the healing time was (5.71 +/- 1.01) months in group A and was (5.81 +/- 1.08) months in group B, showing no significant difference (t=0.381, P=0.705). No fixation failure, breakage, or loosening occurred in 2 groups. According to Baird-Jackson scoring system, the results were excellent in 29 cases, good in 5 cases, and fair in 4 cases with an excellent and good rate of 89.5% in group A at 6 months after operation; the results were excellent in 20 cases, good in 7 cases, and fair in 4 cases with an excellent and good rate of 87.1% in group B; no significant difference was found in the excellent and good rate between 2 groups (Z=0.991, P=0.321).Treatment of tibiofibular syndesmotic disruptions with absorbable screws can get good effectiveness and replace metallic screws because of avoiding additional operation for removing the screw.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640361","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.748472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.705816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.450122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.300053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.198926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Atomic number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"381","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/381"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"1226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1226"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"705","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/705"},{"name":"244","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/244"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
