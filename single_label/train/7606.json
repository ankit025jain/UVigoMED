{"id":7606,"title":"Resuscitation with amiodarone increases survival after hemorrhage and ventricular fibrillation in pigs.","abstract":"Supplemental digital content is available in the text.The aim of this experimental study was to compare survival and hemodynamic effects of a low-dose amiodarone and vasopressin compared with vasopressin in hypovolemic cardiac arrest model in piglets.Eighteen anesthetized male piglets (with a weight of 25.3 [1.8] kg) were bled approximately 30% of the total blood volume via the femoral artery to a mean arterial blood pressure of 35 mm Hg in a 15-minute period. Afterward, the piglets were subjected to 4 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 11 minutes of open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At 5 minutes, circulatory arrest amiodarone 1 mg/kg was intravenously administered in the amiodarone group (n = 9), while the control group received the same amount of saline (n = 9). At the same time, all piglets received vasopressin 0.4 U/kg intravenously administered and hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution 3-mL/kg infusion for 20 minutes. Internal defibrillation was attempted from 7 minutes of cardiac arrest to achieve restoration of spontaneous circulation. The experiment was terminated 3 hours after resuscitation.Three-hour survival was greater in the amiodarone group (p = 0.02). After the successful resuscitation, the amiodarone group piglets had significantly lower heart rate as well as greater systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure. Troponin I plasma concentrations were lower and urine output was greater in the amiodarone group.Combined resuscitation with amiodarone and vasopressin after hemorrhagic circulatory arrest resulted in greater 3-hour survival, better preserved hemodynamic parameters, and smaller myocardial injury compared with resuscitation with vasopressin only.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Animal
