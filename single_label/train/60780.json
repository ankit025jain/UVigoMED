{"id":60780,"title":"Rituximab after lymphoma-directed conditioning and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for relapsed and refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DSHNHL R3): an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial.","abstract":"Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation has had limited success for patients with refractory and relapsed aggressive B-cell or T-cell lymphoma. We investigated the effect of adding rituximab to standard prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease after transplantation and estimated overall survival when using a lymphoma-directed myeloablative conditioning regimen.Between June 16, 2004, and March 24, 2009, we screened 86 patients and enrolled 84; 42 were randomly assigned to each group. The cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease was 46% (95% CI 32-62) in the rituximab group and 42% (95% CI 29-59) in the no rituximab group (hazard ratio [HR] 0路91, 95% CI 0路52-1路60; p=0路74). Overall survival at 1 year for the whole study population was 52% (95% CI 41-62). Grade 4 haematological toxic effects and grade 3 alopecia occurred in all patients. The most common non-haematological grade 5 toxic effects were pneumonia (nine in the no rituximab group vs ten in the rituximab group) and other infections (seven vs four).The lymphoma-directed myeloablative conditioning regimen developed here is promising for patients with refractory and relapsed aggressive B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. However, the addition of rituximab did not affect the incidence of graft-versus-host disease or overall survival.Hoffmann-La Roche, Amgen, Astellas Pharma.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Hemic and
