{"id":91380,"title":"Modified Latarjet procedure for patients with glenoid bone defect accompanied with anterior shoulder instability.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the effects of coracoid bone block (modified Latarjet) procedure on clinical and functional results in cases with glenoid bone defect accompanied with anterior shoulder instability.The study included 35 patients (average age: 35 years; range: 20 to 58 years) with glenoid bone defect and recurrent dislocations treated with the modified Latarjet procedure. There were 12 sports injuries, 5 post-epileptic cases and 18 recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation following non-sports-related injuries. Recurrence was reported in 7 patients formerly treated with the Bankart procedure. Average number of preoperative dislocations was 10.8 ± 6.5 and average time range between the first dislocation and surgery was 14.9 ± 13.2 months. All patients underwent preoperative diagnostic arthroscopy. Postoperative isometric exercises in braces were assigned for the first 6 weeks, followed by active strengthening exercises. Pre- and postoperative functional results were evaluated using the ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) and Rowe scores and pain using the VAS (Visual Analog Scale).Osseous union of coracoid graft was achieved in all patients. Average follow-up was 24 ± 12.2 (range: 12 to 74) months. No degenerative arthritis or continuing instability was detected in any of the patients. Average forward flexion was 165° ± 20° and external rotation 59° ± 13°. Mean preoperative ASES and Rowe scores of 49.6 ± 10.6 and 47.9 ± 21.5 increased postoperatively to 91.3 ± 11 and 89.1 ± 9.2, respectively. Mean VAS scores decreased significantly from 6.2 ± 2.4 to 1.8 ± 0.6 postoperatively (p<0.05).Shoulder functionality and former activity levels can be successfully achieved in terms of increased patient satisfaction through use of the modified Latarjet surgery in the treatment of glenoid bone defect and anterior shoulder instability.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509218","annotations":[{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.820887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.782711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Glenoid cavity","weight":0.780462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.657791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.607513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sports injury","weight":0.515127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_injury"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.478103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Coracoid","weight":0.471227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoid"},{"name":"Dislocated shoulder","weight":0.372918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.317349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.261285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.241444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Isometric exercise","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_exercise"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Analog Science Fiction and Fact","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Rowe, Massachusetts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowe,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"}]}
