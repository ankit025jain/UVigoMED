{"id":47815,"title":"Prognostic performance of a series of model for end-stage liver disease and respective ? scores in patients with hepatitis B acute-on-chronic liver failure.","abstract":"The present study aimed to compare the short-term prognostic performance of a series of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and respective delta (?) scores scoring systems in a population with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF), and to investigate the potential effects from antivirals. A total of 77 patients with ACHBLF of mean age 46 years, 82% male, with 58.4% receiving antivirals, were recruited for this study. The ? scores for MELDs were defined as the changes one week after admission. Thirty?eight (49%) patients (22 treated with antivirals) died within three months. The mean MELD and ?MELD scores of the survival group were 19.5 ± 4.4 and 0.2 ± 3.7 respectively, and those of the mortality group were 23.5 ± 5.5 and 7.9 ± 6, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for MELD, integrated MELD (iMELD), MELD with the addition of serum sodium (MELD-Na), updated MELD (upMELD), MELD excluding the international normalized ratio (INR; MELD-XI), United Kingdom MELD (UKMELD) and their ? scores were 0.72, 0.81, 0.77, 0.69, 0.65, 0.77 and 0.86, 0.83, 0.83, 0.82, 0.79 and 0.79, respectively. iMELD and MELD-Na significantly improved the accuracy of MELD (P<0.05). A cut-off value of 41.5 for the iMELD score can prognose 71% of mortalities with a specificity of 85%. In each pair of models, the ? score was superior to its counterpart, particularly when applied to patients with MELD ? 30. Decreased accuracy was observed for all models in the subset of patients treated with antivirals, although their baseline characteristics were comparable to those of untreated patients, while iMELD, MELD-Na and respective ? models remained superior with regard to the predictability. The iMELD and MELD-Na models predicted three-month mortality more accurately, while the ? models were superior to their counterparts when MELD ? 30; however, their performance was altered by antivirals, and thus requires optimization.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573151","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.774293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.760569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.751375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.738704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.710976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.614782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.532612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.458796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Normalization (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Medical algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_algorithm"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"River delta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Predictability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
