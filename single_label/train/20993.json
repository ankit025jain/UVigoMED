{"id":20993,"title":"A country-wide field evaluation of rapid diagnostic test for meningococcal meningitis.","abstract":"We comment on a unique country-wide scale field evaluation of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for meningococcal meningitis in Niger. The authors reported the good sensitivity and specificity of the test, and the reliability of results obtained in the field by non-specialized health staff. This finding allows us to consider RDT as a good candidate laboratory tool to be used for the case-based surveillance system, post introduction of the new conjugate A vaccine (MenAfriVac) in the African meningitis belt countries. In addition, RDT is also a potential point of care test to improve the management of meningitis patients.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627423","annotations":[{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.797911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.622356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.590315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.469836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.226227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.208444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Niger","weight":0.116559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Meningococcal disease","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease"},{"name":"Laboratory equipment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_equipment"},{"name":"Real Data Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Data_Transport"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"}]}
