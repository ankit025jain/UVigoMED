{"id":78381,"title":"[Acquired pediatric cholesteatoma: predictive factors of recurrence. A retrospective study of 11 years].","abstract":"To define the predictive factors of recurrence of the pediatric acquired cholesteatoma in order to improve the long-term results, to restore a good hearing function and to prevent the complications.A retrospective study concerning all cases of pediatric acquired cholesteatoma, treated during the period 1997-2008 in our center, and followed up for at least one year. A description of the parameters concerning the patients, disease and treatment as well as a univariate analysis were undertaken in order to determine the recurrence predictors. The recurrence-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.26 ears were studied and followed over a mean period of 62 months after the first intervention. The mean age was 12 years (11.7 years) with a 2.7 sex-ratio. The main clinical presentations were otorrhea (65%) and hypoacusia in 42% of cases. Fifteen cases (57.7%) presented an extension to the mastoid, 50% of the ears had an ossicular erosion and 11 cholesteatomas revealed a local or regional invasion. Almost 3/4 (73%) of the cholesteatomas were treated using a canal wall up surgery. The cumulative rate of recurrence was 53.8% and the rate of recurrence-free survival was 84%, 56%, and 44.7% at 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. Only the extension of the cholesteatoma to the mastoid, and the local and regional invasion (sinus tympani, lateral semi-circular canal, facial nerve recess, etc.) of the cholesteatoma at diagnosis, showed a significant higher risk of recurrence (p < 0.05).In our study, the extent of the disease at diagnosis is considered as the major predictive factor of recurrence in pediatric acquired cholesteatoma population raising the problem of delayed diagnosis.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684120","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.532115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.530904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.275016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.175271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0898974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Semicircular canal","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Timpani","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timpani"},{"name":"Horizontal semicircular canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Otorrhea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otorrhea"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Acquired disorder","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_disorder"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Semicircle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
