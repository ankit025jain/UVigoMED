{"id":32361,"title":"Large size VSD with pulmonary stenosis.","abstract":"Defect in the ventricular septum with obstruction to right ventricular outflow tract encompass a wide anatomic, physiological and clinical spectrum. Large ventricular septal defects occur with pulmonary stenosis that varies from mild to severe to complete (pulmonary atresia). Very large VSD (size 6.4 cm, in our case) with severe PS is a rare CHD and without surgical correction only 10% patient can survive beyond 20 year of age. With the help of noninvasive investigation (Echocardiography) we can diagnose CHD very easily.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968558","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonic stenosis","weight":0.895163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonic_stenosis"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.831328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Ventricular outflow tract","weight":0.64186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_outflow_tract"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.419198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary atresia","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_atresia"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.310982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.201224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"}]}
