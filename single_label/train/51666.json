{"id":51666,"title":"Simultaneous GLP-1 and insulin administration acutely enhances their vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant action in type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"To test the hypothesis that the simultaneous administration of GLP-1 and insulin may increase their vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant action in type 2 diabetes.In two groups of persons with type 2 diabetes, two sets of experiments were performed. The first group had two normoglycemic-normoinsulinemic clamps with or without GLP-1 and two normoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps with or without GLP-1. The second group had two hyperglycemic-normoinsulinemic clamps and two hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps with or without GLP-1.During the normoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) increased, while soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1), plasma 8-iso-prostaglandin F2? (8-iso-PGF2?), nitrotyrosine, and interleukin (IL)-6 decreased compared with normoglycemic-normoinsulinemic clamp. Similar results were obtained with the infusion of GLP-1 during the normoglycemic-normoinsulinemic clamp. The combination of hyperinsulinemia and GLP-1 in normoglycemia was accompanied by a further FMD increase and sICAM-1, 8-iso-PGF2?, nitrotyrosine, and IL-6 decrease. During the hyperglycemic-normoinsulinemic clamp, FMD significantly decreased, while sICAM-1, 8-iso-PGF2?, nitrotyrosine, and IL-6 significantly increased. When hyperglycemia was accompanied by hyperinsulinemia or by the simultaneous infusion of GLP-1, these phenomena were attenuated. The simultaneous presence of hyperinsulinemia and GLP-1 had an increased beneficial effect.Our results show that the combination of insulin and GLP-1 is more effective than insulin or GLP-1 alone in improving endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667461","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.776736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.770731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.409085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Hyperinsulinemia","weight":0.267241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinsulinemia"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.187341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"}]}
