{"id":44226,"title":"O-GlcNAcylation stabilizes ?-catenin through direct competition with phosphorylation at threonine 41.","abstract":"Dysfunctions in Wnt signaling increase ?-catenin stability and are associated with cancers, including colorectal cancer. In addition, ?-catenin degradation is decreased by nutrient-dependent O-GlcNAcylation. Human colon tumors and colons from mice fed high-carbohydrate diets exhibited higher amounts of ?-catenin and O-GlcNAc relative to healthy tissues and mice fed a standard diet, respectively. Administration of the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor thiamet G to mice also increased colonic expression of ?-catenin. By ETD-MS/MS, we identified 4 O-GlcNAcylation sites at the N terminus of ?-catenin (S23/T40/T41/T112). Furthermore, mutation of serine and threonine residues within the D box of ?-catenin reduced O-GlcNAcylation by 75%. Interestingly, elevating O-GlcNAcylation in human colon cell lines drastically reduced phosphorylation at T41, a key residue of the D box responsible for ?-catenin stability. Analyses of ?-catenin O-GlcNAcylation mutants reinforced T41 as the most crucial residue that controls the ?-catenin degradation rate. Finally, inhibiting O-GlcNAcylation decreased the ?-catenin/?-catenin interaction necessary for mucosa integrity, whereas O-GlcNAcase silencing improved this interaction. These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation regulates not only the stability of ?-catenin, but also affects its localization at the level of adherens junctions. Accordingly, we propose that O-GlcNAcylation of ?-catenin is a missing link between the glucose metabolism deregulation observed in metabolic disorders and the development of cancer.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744147","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Threonine","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.791481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"N-terminus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.713363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase","weight":0.570178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine/threonine-specific_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.541654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.424967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.382956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.361358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.325721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Adherens junction","weight":0.118346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adherens_junction"},{"name":"Transitional fossil","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossil"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.026953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Competition","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Gap junction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
