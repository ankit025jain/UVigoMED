{"id":92042,"title":"[Human serum albumin modified under oxidative/halogenative stress enhances luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of human neutrophils].","abstract":"It is shown that human serum albumin, previously treated with HOCl (HSA-Cl), enhances luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of neutrophils activated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that addition of HSA-Cl to neutrophils promotes exocytosis of myeloperoxidase. Inhibitor of myeloperoxidase--4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, without any effect on lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence of neutrophils stimulated with PMA, effectively suppressed luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (IC50 = 20 microM) under the same conditions. The transfer of the cells from medium with HSA-Cl and myeloperoxidase to fresh medium abolished an increase in PMA-induced luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, but not the ability of neutrophils to respond to re-addition of HSA-Cl. A direct and significant (r = 0.75, p) correlation was observed between the intensity of PMA stimulated neutrophil chemiluminescence response and myeloperoxidase activity in the cell-free media after chemiluminescence measurements. These results suggest the involvement of myeloperoxidase in the increase of neutrophil PMA-stimulated chemiluminescence response in the presence of HSA-Cl. A significant positive correlation was found between myeloperoxidase activity in blood plasma of children with severe burns and the enhancing effects of albumin fraction of the same plasma on luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of PMA-stimulated donor neutrophils. These results support a hypothesis that proteins modified in reactions involving myeloperoxidase under oxidative/halogenative stress, stimulate neutrophils, leading to exocytosis of myeloperoxidase, a key element of halogenative stress, and to closing a \"vicious circle\" of neutrophil activation at the inflammatory site.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455888","annotations":[{"name":"Exocytosis","weight":0.898868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocytosis"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Human serum albumin","weight":0.848933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_serum_albumin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.749944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.531984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Chemiluminescence","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.410982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.393059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Hypochlorous acid","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorous_acid"},{"name":"Positive feedback","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Hydrazide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazide"},{"name":"Phorbol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phorbol"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Myristic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myristic_acid"},{"name":"Para-Methoxyamphetamine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para-Methoxyamphetamine"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"}]}
