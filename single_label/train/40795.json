{"id":40795,"title":"Serum oxidative stress markers and lipidomic profile to detect NASH patients responsive to an antioxidant treatment: a pilot study.","abstract":"Liver steatosis can evolve to steatohepatitis (NASH) through a series of biochemical steps related to oxidative stress in hepatocytes. Antioxidants, such as silybin, have been proposed as a treatment of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH. In this study, we evaluated, in patients with histologically documented NASH, the oxidant/antioxidant status and lipid \"fingerprint\" in the serum of NASH patients, both in basal conditions and after 12 months of treatment with silybin-based food integrator Realsil (RA). The oxidant/antioxidant status analysis showed the presence of a group of patients with higher basal severity of disease (NAS scores 4.67?±?2.5) and a second group corresponding to borderline NASH (NAS scores?=?3.8?±?1.5). The chronic treatment with RA changed the NAS score in both groups that reached the statistical significance only in group 2, in which there was also a significant decrease of serum lipid peroxidation. The lipidomic profile showed a lipid composition similar to that of healthy subjects with a restoration of the values of free cholesterol, lysoPC, SM, and PC only in group 2 of patients after treatment with RA. Conclusion. These data suggest that lipidomic and/or oxidative status of serum from patients with NASH could be useful as prognostic markers of response to an antioxidant treatment.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24987492","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.811032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.6788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.515209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.387173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.386135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Silibinin","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.25811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Steatohepatitis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatohepatitis"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Fingerprint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"},{"name":"United States National Academy of Sciences","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Master of Science","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
