{"id":43080,"title":"Weight loss in HCV patients can be used as a surrogate marker for evaluation of interferon (IFN-?) treatment efficacy - a prospective pilot study.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate whether weight loss followed the same pattern in HCV patients ('responders' and 'non-responders) after interferon (IFN-?) treatment. A total of 20 male HCV positive patients (mean age 33.1±9.9) in Peshawar, Pakistan participated in this study. They were initially tested as HCV positive, and were given IFN/Ribavarin treatment for 6 months. Changes in body weight (BW), lean body mass (LBM) and body fat (BF) were monitored on monthly basis. End to treatment response (ETR) was established by a final undetectable HCV RNA in serum at the end of therapy and the patients were categorized as either 'responders' or 'non-responders'. The results show a total of 12 out of 20 patients as 'responders' (60%). All patients lost weight and the mean weight loss in 'responders' and 'non-responders' was 6.2 (±1.5) and 5.8 (±1.4) Kg, respectively. There was a significant difference in the mean change in BW, LBM, and BF between 'responders' and 'non-responders' during the last 3 month period only. This suggests that difference in drug response in HCV starts from month 4 and onwards (i.e. during the last 3 months). In conclusion, weight trends during treatment should be monitored as weight loss may be used as a surrogate marker for ERT to the current standard of care.
