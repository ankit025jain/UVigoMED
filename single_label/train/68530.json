{"id":68530,"title":"Validation of the preoperative plasma fibrinogen level as a prognostic factor in a European cohort of patients with localized upper tract urothelial carcinoma.","abstract":"Fibrinogen is thought to have a potentially significant role in the progression and metastatic spread of different human cancers. A recent study from Asia indicated that elevated preoperative plasma fibrinogen might be associated with a worse outcome in patients with surgically treated localized upper tract urothelial carcinoma. We validated the prognostic impact of this potential biomarker in a European cohort of patients with localized upper tract urothelial carcinoma.We evaluated data on 167 patients with nonmetastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma who underwent surgery between 1990 and 2012 at a single tertiary academic center. Patients were categorized using an optimal cutoff value of preoperative plasma fibrinogen. Patient cancer specific and overall survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were performed for each end point. The influence of fibrinogen on the predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was further determined by the Harrell c-index.Multivariate analysis identified increased preoperative plasma fibrinogen as an independent prognostic factor for cancer specific survival (HR 3.00, 95% CI 1.32-6.80, p = 0.008) and overall survival (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.31-4.68, p = 0.005). The estimated c-index of the multivariate model for cancer specific survival was 0.72 without fibrinogen and 0.74 when fibrinogen was added. The risk model that we developed significantly differentiated between low, intermediate and high risk groups for cancer related death (p <0.001).Elevated fibrinogen seems to represent a negative prognostic factor for cancer specific and overall survival in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. This parameter should be considered an additional prognostic factor for upper tract urothelial carcinoma in the future.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital
