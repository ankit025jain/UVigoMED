{"id":55832,"title":"Anterior chamber keratinous horn.","abstract":"A 14-year-old boy presented with a 6-month history of small white masses in his right eye. Examination revealed a white floating fluffy lesion and 2 vegetative hornlike white lesions originating at the periphery of the iris. On ultrasound biomicroscopy, a normal echogenic mass was detected on the inferior iris root and angle, with no posterior chamber or cilliary body involvement. Histopathology following an excisional biopsy revealed keratinous material. There was no recurrence during 10 months of follow-up.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797250","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.709413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.698359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.639852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Keratin","weight":0.359776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.347281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.287523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.238867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.194893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Posterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Horn (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 14","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_14"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"}]}
