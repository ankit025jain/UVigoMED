{"id":78756,"title":"Acute vertigo due to hemispheric stroke: a case report and comprehensive review of the literature.","abstract":"Acute cortical lesions rarely cause vertigo. We report a 51-year-old patient presenting with an acute vestibular syndrome including spontaneous vertigo and nystagmus, lateropulsion and nausea due to middle cerebral artery infarction. The central origin of the acute vestibular syndrome was revealed by a normal head impulse test. A comprehensive literature review on patients with hemispheric stroke manifesting with acute vertigo is provided. Typically, patients with an acute vestibular syndrome due to cortical stroke have involvement of the temporoparietal junction.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581670","annotations":[{"name":"Pathologic nystagmus","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_nystagmus"},{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.841204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.349222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.0804318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Temporoparietal junction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporoparietal_junction"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
