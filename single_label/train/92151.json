{"id":92151,"title":"Dual mobility cup reduces dislocation and re-operation when used to treat displaced femoral neck fractures.","abstract":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) as primary treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures is controversial as THA is associated with higher rates of dislocation but lower rates of re-operation compared to hemiarthroplasty (HA). A dual mobility cup (DMC) design is associated with lower dislocation and re-operation rates in elective surgery. Is this also the case when used to treat displaced femoral neck fractures? The aim of this study is to compare rates of dislocation and re-operation of any kind following treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures with either bipolar HA or THA with DMC.Two consecutive groups of patients treated for displaced femoral neck fractures at the Regional Hospital in Viborg in Denmark were included. In 2007-2008 171 patients (mean age 84.1 years) were treated with bipolar HA. In 2009-2010 175 patients (mean age 75.2 years) were treated with THA with DMC. Data regarding rates of dislocation and re-operation were obtained by retrospective review of medical records.We found a statistically significant difference regarding rates of dislocation and re-operation of any kind in favour of THA with DMC. Dislocation occurred in 25/171 patients [95 % confidence interval (CI) 9.3-19.9 %] treated with bipolar HA and 8/175 patients (95 % CI 1.5-7.7 %) treated with THA with DMC (p?=?0.002). Re-operations were required in 32/171 patients (95 % CI 12.9-24.6 %) treated with bipolar HA and 16/175 patients (95 % CI 4.8-13.4 %) treated with THA with DMC (p?=?0.01).Our findings indicate that THA with DMC is superior to bipolar HA following treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures in regard to rates of dislocation and re-operation.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441666","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.497344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.386179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.263198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0869915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Viborg, Denmark","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viborg,_Denmark"},{"name":"Hemiarthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiarthroplasty"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"813","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/813"},{"name":"319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/319"},{"name":"924","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/924"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Elective surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"}]}
