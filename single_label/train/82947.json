{"id":82947,"title":"Effects of Er:YAG laser on bond strength of self-etching adhesives to caries-affected dentin.","abstract":"The erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser may be effective the bond strength of adhesive systems on dentine surfaces, the chemical composition and aggressiveness of adhesive systems in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the Er:YAG laser system with the bonding ability of two different self-etching adhesives to caries-affected dentine in primary molars. Ninety mid-coronal flat dentine surfaces obtained from sound and caries-affected human primary dentine were treated with an Er:YAG laser or a bur. The prepared surfaces were restored with an adhesive system (Xeno V; Clearfil S³) and a compomer (Dyract Extra). The restored teeth were sectioned with a low-speed saw and 162 samples were obtained. The bond strength of the adhesive systems was tested using the micro-tensile test method. The data were statistically analyzed. A restored tooth in each group was processed for scanning electron microscopy evaluation. The values of the highest bond strength were obtained from the Clearfil S³-Er:YAG laser-sound dentine group in all groups. (24.57?±?7.27 MPa) (P?>?0.05). The values of the lowest bond strength were obtained from the Xeno V-Er:YAG laser-sound dentine group in all groups (11.01?±?3.89 MPa). It was determined that the Clearfil S³ increased the bond strength on the surface applied with Er:YAG laser according to the Xeno V.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481952","annotations":[{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Empirical formula","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_formula"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.666867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.625748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Test method","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_method"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.307663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.276804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.261872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Bond strength","weight":0.201148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_strength"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.171066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Erbium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbium"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Yttrium aluminium garnet","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium_aluminium_garnet"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"577","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/577"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Xenosaga","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenosaga"},{"name":"Composition (visual arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(visual_arts)"},{"name":"Extra (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Bur","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bur"},{"name":"Europium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europium"},{"name":"Involuntary commitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
