{"id":84275,"title":"Associations between liver enzymes, psychopathological and clinical features in eating disorders.","abstract":"Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are frequently reported in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and in subjects who are overweight or with hyperlipidemia, which can be found to be associated with binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Liver functioning and psychopathological features have been evaluated in 43 patients with AN, 33 with BN, and 32 with BED. Body mass index was found to be inversely associated with AST and ALT in AN, and directly associated with AST and ALT in BED. A positive association between ALT and AST and body shape concern in AN was observed. Liver enzymes could be considered as an index of severity in AN and BED patients.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139759","annotations":[{"name":"Bulimia nervosa","weight":0.890526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa"},{"name":"Binge eating disorder","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating_disorder"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.886455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.864833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Anorexia nervosa","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Binge eating","weight":0.636573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.59441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.460693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Body shape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shape"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}]}
