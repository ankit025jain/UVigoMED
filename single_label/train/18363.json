{"id":18363,"title":"Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column hemoperfusion removes endotoxin throughout a 24-hour treatment period.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of endotoxin adsorption by polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column hemoperfusion (PMX) performed for a 24-hour treatment period in patients with septic shock.Nineteen patients with septic shock were retrospectively studied. The plasma endotoxin concentrations of blood drawn from the radial artery and from the outlet circuit of the PMX column were measured by kinetic turbidimetric limulus assay using an MT-358 Toxinometer (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd, Osaka, Japan) after 24 hours of PMX treatment. The endotoxin removal rate was defined by the following equation: ([radial artery endotoxin concentration - outlet circuit of PMX column endotoxin concentration]/radial artery endotoxin concentration) Ã— 100%.The patients had a median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 29 at intensive care unit admission and a 28-day mortality of 47%. Before the start of the PMX treatment, the median radial arterial plasma endotoxin concentration was 16.48 pg/mL. After 24 hours of PMX treatment, the median radial plasma endotoxin concentration had decreased to 1.857 pg/mL, and the concentration at the outlet circuit of the PMX column was further decreased to 0.779 pg/mL. The median endotoxin removal rate was 74.4%.These findings suggest that 24-hour PMX treatment was effective in removing endotoxin continuously throughout the entire treatment period.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798345","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.864377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.803668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.760685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.711061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.67708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.664554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.654509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Radial artery","weight":0.622038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_artery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Osaka","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka"},{"name":"Polymyxin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyxin"},{"name":"Hemoperfusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoperfusion"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Montana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana"},{"name":"779","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/779"},{"name":"857","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/857"},{"name":"358","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/358"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"PMX (technology)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMX_(technology)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"}]}
