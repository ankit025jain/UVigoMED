{"id":67112,"title":"Elevated urinary CCL2: Cr at 6 months is associated with renal allograft interstitial fibrosis and inflammation at 24 months.","abstract":"We have demonstrated that 6-month urinary CCL2: Cr is a predictor of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) on 24-month biopsy and death-censored graft loss. However, IFTA is no longer considered prognostically significant, whereas patients with graft loss frequently have interstitial fibrosis and inflammation (IF+i=ci>0+i>0). As early CCL2: Cr predicts late graft loss, the goal of this study was to determine if 6-month urinary CCL2: Cr was a predictor of IF+i at 24 months.Urinary CCL2 at 6 months was measured with ELISA and correlated with IF+i on 24-month surveillance biopsies from a prospective, multicenter adult renal transplant cohort (n=111).Six-month urinary CCL2: Cr was significantly higher in IF+i and transplant glomerulopathy patients compared with normal histology at 24 months. By multivariate analysis, 6-month urinary CCL2: Cr was independently correlated with IF+i at 24 months (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.38-6.12, AUC 0.695, P=0.003). Six-month urinary CCL2: Cr was also an independent correlate of 6-month IF+i (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.03-4.18, AUC 0.63, P=0.04). Six-month urinary CCL2: Cr distinguished noninflamed renal tissue (normal, fibrosis) from IF+i with a sensitivity/specificity of 0.71/0.62 at a cutoff of 15 ng CCL2/mmol Cr (AUC 0.695, P=0.003, n=91).Urinary CCL2: Cr may be useful for the noninvasive identification of patients with or at risk for IF+i. These patients may benefit from avoidance of drug minimization/withdrawal protocols and more intensive post-transplant surveillance. Furthermore, urinary CCL2: Cr may also identify individuals who may benefit from novel interventional trials targeting IF+i.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646773","annotations":[{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.902927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.703373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.69807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"Irish Film and Television Awards","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Film_and_Television_Awards"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"695","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/695"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Chromium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
