{"id":46753,"title":"A case of irreversible leukoencephalopathy in a patient with C virus hepatitis treated with pegylated interferon-alpha-2b and ribavirin.","abstract":"We describe the case of a patient with C chronic hepatitis and early virological response on pegylated-interferon-alpha based therapy who presented clinical manifestations and magnetic resonance imaging suggestive for toxic leukoencephalopathy after 5 months of treatment. The negative results for neurotropic infectious agents and autoimmune markers opened the discussion of toxic interferon-induced leukoencephalopathy as a rare, but threatening neurologic side effect of this therapy.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620633","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.809346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.77453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.642546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.534623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Neurotropic virus","weight":0.201238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotropic_virus"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
