{"id":42469,"title":"Section 2. Small-for-size liver graft and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence.","abstract":"Liver transplantation (LT) is the most effective treatment for small and unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). With scarcity of deceased donor livers, living donor LT (LDLT) is the alternative to deceased donor LT (DDLT). Animal studies have suggested that regeneration of the partial liver graft encourages HCC recurrence. Increased recurrence was observed in a few studies. Thus, there is the belief that the use of small-for-size graft carries the potential risk of disease recurrence. Nevertheless, those studies were retrospective, with sample sizes not large enough for conclusions.Living donor LT can be performed when a suitable donor is available. The fast tracking of patients for transplantation without a period of observation is an issue. Meta-analyses, however, showed no significant increase in HCC recurrence after LDLT. Patients listed for DDLT and without suitable living donors have to endure a long wait, during which the aggressiveness of their HCC is observed. Such observation almost guarantees slow disease progression when they get transplanted. Nevertheless, a long wait has the disadvantage of transplanting patients with more advanced tumors, although still within standard criteria. Judicious use of deceased donor grafts is the responsibility of the transplant community.Living donor LT for HCC should only be performed after careful assessment of the recipient and tumor status. Although tumor size and number are references widely adopted in tumor staging, biological staging of tumors using positron emission tomography could provide additional information of tumor behavior. A high level of serum ?-fetoprotein also warns against LT because it is predictive of a high HCC recurrence rate.
