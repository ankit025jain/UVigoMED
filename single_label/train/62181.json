{"id":62181,"title":"Randomized clinical trial of human interleukin-11 in Dengue fever-associated thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"To assess the effectiveness of recombinant human (rh) IL-11 to increase platelets count in patients suffering from Dengue fever (DF).Randomized double blind placebo control study.Farooq Hospital, Lahore, from July to October 2011.Forty hospitalized patients suffering from Dengue fever having platelets count Â² 30000 per micro liter were randomly categorized into two groups, rhIL-11 (test) and distilled water (placebo) groups. The efficacy outcomes (as indicated by step up in platelets count at 48 hours) for the treatment group were compared with the outcomes for the placebo group.The data revealed that the increase in platelet response with recombinant human interleukin 11, 1.5 mg subcutaneously is significantly more brisk than the placebo group. The platelets response in patients with severe thrombocytopenia was greater in the treatment group (50%) at 48 hours as compared to the placebo group (20%) (p=0.047). Response rate was slightly greater among males (6/10, 60%) than females (8/16, 50%); moreover, three-fourth (75%) female responders were in the placebo group, compared to half (50%) male responders in the treatment group.Results of the study suggest that treatment of severe thrombocytopenia accompanying DF with recombinant human interleukin11 may be a useful therapeutic option.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613110","annotations":[{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.706597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.626523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.597457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.597453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.46808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.44355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.286157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Double blind","weight":0.267195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_blind"},{"name":"Interleukin 11","weight":0.250023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_11"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"Lahore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
