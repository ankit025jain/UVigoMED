{"id":88012,"title":"A positive tangent sign predicts the repairability of rotator cuff tears.","abstract":"We hypothesize that patients with a positive tangent sign will have rotator cuff tears that are not able to be repaired primarily.We performed a retrospective review of the charts of patients who had undergone surgery for repair of a rotator cuff tear. The operative note was reviewed to determine whether the cuff tear was primarily repaired. The magnetic resonance imaging study of each patient was reviewed to assess for a positive or negative tangent sign. The reviewer was blinded to the result of each measurement.Eighty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. Of the 79 included in our analyses, 17 had a positive tangent sign and 62 had a negative tangent sign. There was only 1 patient with a negative tangent sign who had an irreparable rotator cuff tear. There were 3 patients with a positive tangent sign who had a repairable rotator cuff. With a pretest prevalence of irreparable tears of 18.9%, a positive finding suggested a post-test probability of 82.3% with a positive tangent sign and a post-test probability of only 1.6% when the tangent sign was negative.Our results showed decision-making value in both a negative tangent sign and a positive tangent sign. The tangent sign is an easily performed and reproducible tool with good intraobserver and interobserver reliability that is a powerful predictor of whether a rotator cuff tear will be repairable.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929744","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.837143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.162852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Rotator cuff tear","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff_tear"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Repairable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repairable"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Tangent","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent"}]}
