{"id":19995,"title":"Interferon lambda-2 levels in sputum of patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.","abstract":"In humans, there are three members of type III interferon family, designated as IFN-?1 (IL-29), IFN-?2 (IL-28A) and IFN-?3 (IL-28B). Bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, trigger the expression of interferon I and II genes, but little is known about their effect on IFN-? genes. It has been found that M. tuberculosis infection in A549 lung epithelial cells stimulate upregulation of IFN-?2 genes in vitro. The aim of this study was to determine the IFN-?2 levels in sputum of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis comparing with levels in healthy persons sputum and sputum of persons with latent tuberculosis. IFN-?2 level in the samples was quantified with sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay kit for quantization of human IFN-?2 (IL-28A). The IFN-?2 level in sputum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was significantly higher comparing with IFN-?2 levels in healthy group (P = 0.001) and latent tuberculosis group (P = 0.005). Logistic regression analysis has shown that IFN-?2 level in sputum is related to culture result (OR = 4.14; 95% CI = 1.28-17.5; P = 0.019). There was the correlation between Bartlett score and IFN-?2 levels in group with pulmonary tuberculosis (r = 0.641; P < 0.01). In conclusion, we have found that the inflammatory cells in sputum can be source of IFN-? after receptor stimulation by M. tuberculosis components.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684674","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.513123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.240731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.23879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Lambda phage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Quantum mechanics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics"}]}
