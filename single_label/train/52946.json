{"id":52946,"title":"Liraglutide decreases carotid intima-media thickness in patients with type 2 diabetes: 8-month prospective pilot study.","abstract":"Liraglutide, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, has several non- glycemic properties, but its effect on carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a recognized marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, is still unknown.A prospective study of 8 months duration in 64 patients with type-2 diabetes and no prior history of coronary artery disease evaluated whether adding liraglutide to metformin affects carotid IMT, measured by color doppler ultrasound.After 8 months, fasting glucose decreased by 2.1 mmol/l and HbA1c by 1.9% (p?<?0.01 for all). Liraglutide reduced total-cholesterol and triglycerides by 10%, and LDL-cholesterol by 19%, whereas HDL-cholesterol increased by 18% (p?<?0.01 for all lipid changes). Carotid IMT decreased from 1.19?±?0.47 to 0.94?±?0.21 mm (p?<?0.01). Yet, changes in carotid IMT did not correlate with changes in any other variable studied.Liraglutide decreases carotid IMT after 8 months treatment independently of its effect on plasma glucose and lipids concentrations.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559258","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.782931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.724742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.636446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Liraglutide","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liraglutide"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
