{"id":90329,"title":"[Prevalence of nasal septum injury in premature infants using nasal prongs].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with nasal septum injury in preterm infants in the use of noninvasive ventilation. A cross-sectional study with data collection between March and July 2012 and with search for records, interviews with mothers and nasal evaluation of 47 premature in the neonatal unit of a teaching hospital in Recife, Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. A descriptive bivariate statistical analysis was performed through the chi-square test or Fisher exact test using the SPSS software. The prevalence of nasal lesions was 68.1%, associated with low birth weight and duration of treatment. The prevalence of nasal injury in this population is high and associated with low birth weight and length of stay in noninvasive ventilation. Due to these facts the necessity for preventive actions was noticed, such as continuous care in nursing, suitability of devices and permanent education in service.
