{"id":68470,"title":"Efficacy of fesoterodine on nocturia and quality of sleep in Asian patients with overactive bladder.","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy of fesoterodine vs placebo on nocturia, sleep disturbance, and sleep-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with overactive bladder and nocturia.This posthoc analysis used data from a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of fesoterodine 4 and 8 mg per day in Asian adults reporting ?8 micturitions and ?1 urgency urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours at baseline. Patients who reported ?1 nocturnal micturition/24 h were included in this analysis. Efficacy variables included change from baseline to week 12/end of treatment in nocturnal micturitions/24 h, nocturnal voided volume/micturition, and hours of undisturbed sleep. Sleep-related QoL was assessed using King's Health Questionnaire Sleep/Energy domain. Treatment comparisons were made using analysis of covariance.Among 555 patients, reductions in nocturnal micturitions with fesoterodine 4 mg (-0.63) and 8 mg (-0.77) were numerically greater vs placebo (-0.56), but differences were not significant (P >.05). When patients with a nocturnal polyuria index >33% were excluded, the decrease in nocturnal micturitions was significantly greater with fesoterodine 8 mg vs placebo (-0.24; P = .031). Increases in nocturnal voided volume/micturition were significantly greater with fesoterodine 4 (38.07 mL; P = .013) and 8 mg (42.05 mL; P <.001) vs placebo (14.89 mL). Hours of undisturbed sleep was significantly longer with fesoterodine 4 mg vs placebo (80 vs 54 minutes; P = .032); improvement in King's Health Questionnaire Sleep/Energy scores was significantly greater with fesoterodine 4 (P = .034) and 8 mg (P = .019) vs placebo.These results suggest that fesoterodine may reduce nocturnal micturitions and improve sleep quality and QoL in overactive bladder patients with nocturia.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518285","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.753905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Polyuria","weight":0.750827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyuria"},{"name":"Nocturia","weight":0.736507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturia"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.731918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.682305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.277288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Analysis of covariance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance"},{"name":"Fesoterodine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fesoterodine"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Numerical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Covariance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Void (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(law)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
