{"id":87767,"title":"Application of Rasch analysis to Turkish version of ECOS-16 questionnaire.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to reevaluate validity of Turkish version of the ECOS-16 questionnaire by using Rasch analysis in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. ECOS-16 (Assessment of health related quality of life in osteoporosis) is a quality of life questionnaire, which is convenient for measuring the quality of life of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. 132 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis who attended Uludag Universtity, Atat√ºrk Rehabilitation and Research Center between January 2010 and March 2011 were included in this study. The subjects filled out Turkish version of ECOS-16 questionnaire by themselves. The Rasch model was used for assessing construct validity of ECOS-16 data. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The mean infit and outfit mean square (z std) were found as 1.08 (0.1) and 1.02 (-0.1), respectively. The separation indices for the item and person were found as 7.72 and 3.13; the separation reliabilities were 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was found as 0.90. The construct validity of ECOS-16 questionnaire was assessed by Rasch analysis.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992253","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.45027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.246245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Rasch model","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasch_model"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Z","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Square (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry)"},{"name":"Georg Rasch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Rasch"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"ECOS","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECOS"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"C++ Standard Library","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++_Standard_Library"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
