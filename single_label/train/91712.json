{"id":91712,"title":"An assessment of an outcome of injury questionnaire using a Pacific model of health and wellbeing.","abstract":"To use a Pacific model of health to describe relationships between questions within a structured questionnaire developed for a prospective study of injured New Zealand residents' outcomes and important elements of Pacific people's health; and identify health issues of particular importance for Pacific peoples that future studies may consider including.The Fonofale model of Pacific health identifies culture, family, physical, spiritual, and 'other' elements (e.g. socioeconomic status and service use) as important. In consultation with Pacific researchers, each question from a Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study (POIS) questionnaire was assessed. Relationship between the type and number of POIS questions were considered in relation to each of the Fonofale elements.Two-thirds of the POIS questions were able to be placed within a single element of the Fonofale model; remaining questions were placed into multiple elements. The POIS questionnaire strongly addressed the physical, mental and 'other' Fonofale elements. Culture, spirituality and family elements were not strongly addressed.The Fonofale model identified areas of strength in the POIS questionnaire, and areas of limitation. Researchers undertaking population studies or surveys could consider using a Pacific model to help inform structured questionnaire development.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481384","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.718697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.583977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.418291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.191112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.171192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Pacific Ocean","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
