{"id":23582,"title":"Fatal empyema thoracis caused by Schizophyllum commune with cross-reactive cryptococcal antigenemia.","abstract":"We report a fatal case of Schizophyllum commune empyema thoracis with cross-reactive cryptococcal antigenemia. In vitro testing confirmed the ability of the fungus to cause a positive cryptococcal antigen latex agglutination system (CALAS) test result. Such a result may lead to delay in diagnosis and treatment, as most strains of S. commune are resistant to fluconazole.
