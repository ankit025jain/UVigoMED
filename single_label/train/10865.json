{"id":10865,"title":"Vessel wall BAMBI contributes to hemostasis and thrombus stability.","abstract":"Bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) is a transmembrane protein related to the transforming growth factor-? superfamily, and is highly expressed in platelets and endothelial cells. We previously demonstrated its positive role in thrombus formation using a zebrafish thrombosis model. In the present study, we used Bambi-deficient mice and radiation chimeras to evaluate the function of this receptor in the regulation of both hemostasis and thrombosis. We show that Bambi(-/-) and Bambi(+/-) mice exhibit mildly prolonged bleeding times compared with Bambi(+/+) littermates. In addition, using 2 in vivo thrombosis models in mesenterium or cremaster muscle arterioles, we demonstrate that Bambi-deficient mice form unstable thrombi compared with Bambi(+/+) mice. No defects in thrombin generation in Bambi(-/-) mouse plasma could be detected ex vivo. Moreover, the absence of BAMBI had no effect on platelet counts, platelet activation, aggregation, or platelet procoagulant function. Similar to Bambi(-/-) mice, Bambi(-/-) transplanted with Bambi(+/+) bone marrow formed unstable thrombi in the laser-induced thrombosis model that receded more rapidly than thrombi that formed in Bambi(+/+) mice receiving Bambi(-/-) bone marrow transplants. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for an important role of endothelium rather than platelet BAMBI as a positive regulator of both thrombus formation and stability.
