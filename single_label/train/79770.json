{"id":79770,"title":"Effect of ozonide OZ418 against Schistosoma japonicum harbored in mice.","abstract":"The in vitro and in vivo efficacies of ozonide carboxylic acid OZ418 against Schistosoma japonicum were investigated. For in vitro experiments, juvenile (14-day-old) and adult schistosomes were collected from mice infected with 80-100?S. japonicum cercariae for 14 and 35 days post-infection and the worms were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 supplemented by 10% calf serum. Against 35-day-old adult S. japonicum, OZ418 resulted in weakened worm motor activity, injury to the worm body, emergence of vacuoles along the worm surface, and death. A similar outcome was seen in 14-day-old juvenile S. japonicum exposed to OZ418. Ineffective concentrations (1, 5, and 10 ?g/mL) of OZ418 also interacted with hemin to significantly increase the killing effect against adult schistosomes. The LC50 value of OZ418 against juvenile (14-day-old) and adult schistosomes were identical--16.2 ?g/mL, whereas the corresponding LC95 values were 30.7 and 22.7 ?g/mL, respectively. Treatment of adult and juvenile (14-day-old) S. japonicum-infected mice with single 200-400-mg/kg oral doses of OZ418 produced total worm burden reductions of 68.5-84.1 and 37.5-50.9%, respectively. Further study showed that in mice infected with various stages of schistosomes and treated with a single oral OZ418 400 mg/kg, poor efficacy was seen in the 3-h-old juvenile worm group, while 14-day-old and 21-day-old juvenile worm groups exhibited less efficacy with total worm burden reductions of 42.6-52.4%. On the other hand, similar and higher total worm burden reductions (64.2-76.0%) were seen in the 7-day-old juvenile worm group and 28-day-old as well as 35-day-old adult worm groups. Furthermore, the mean worm burden reductions of the 7-day-old juvenile worm group and 35-day-old adult worm group were statistically significantly higher than that of the 14-day-old or 21-day-old juvenile worm group (P?<?0.01 or <0.05). These data suggest that OZ418 has promising efficacy against 7-day-old juvenile and adult S. japonicum.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24948106","annotations":[{"name":"Carboxylic acid","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.81461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.722734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.569077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.433643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.396419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Vacuole","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuole"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.174319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.121708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Trematode lifecycle stages","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematode_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Ozonide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozonide"},{"name":"Fetal bovine serum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_bovine_serum"},{"name":"Hemin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemin"},{"name":"Roswell Park Cancer Institute","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_Park_Cancer_Institute"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Calf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf"},{"name":"1640","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1640"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"584","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/584"},{"name":"652","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/652"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Juvenile (organism)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)"}]}
