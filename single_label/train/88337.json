{"id":88337,"title":"Reducing injury risk from body checking in boys' youth ice hockey.","abstract":"Ice hockey is an increasingly popular sport that allows intentional collision in the form of body checking for males but not for females. There is a two- to threefold increased risk of all injury, severe injury, and concussion related to body checking at all levels of boys' youth ice hockey. The American Academy of Pediatrics reinforces the importance of stringent enforcement of rules to protect player safety as well as educational interventions to decrease unsafe tactics. To promote ice hockey as a lifelong recreational pursuit for boys, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the expansion of nonchecking programs and the restriction of body checking to elite levels of boys' youth ice hockey, starting no earlier than 15 years of age.","date":"2014-07-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864185","annotations":[{"name":"Sport","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.44614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.388943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.339055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.334918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ice hockey","weight":0.329984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey"},{"name":"Ice","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Collision","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"American Academy of Pediatrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Cheque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheque"},{"name":"Check-in","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check-in"},{"name":"Checking (ice hockey)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_(ice_hockey)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Elite","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"},{"name":"Response to intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_to_intervention"}]}
