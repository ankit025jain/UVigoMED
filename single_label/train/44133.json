{"id":44133,"title":"Current status and future perspectives of endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of diminutive colorectal polyps.","abstract":"During colonoscopy, small and diminutive colorectal polyps are commonly encountered. It is estimated that at least one adenomatous polyp is detected in almost half of all patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. In contrast, the 'predict, resect, and discard' strategy for diminutive and small colorectal polyps is a current topic especially in Western countries. 'Is this an acceptable policy in Japan?' Herein, we report the results of a questionnaire survey with regard to the management of diminutive colorectal polyps, including the thoughts of Japanese endoscopists regarding the 'predict, resect, and discard' strategy. At the moment, we propose that this strategy should be used by skilled endoscopists only.
