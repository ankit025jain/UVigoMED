{"id":71682,"title":"X-chromosome genetic association test accounting for X-inactivation, skewed X-inactivation, and escape from X-inactivation.","abstract":"X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the process in which one of the two copies of the X-chromosome in females is randomly inactivated to achieve the dosage compensation of X-linked genes between males and females. That is, 50% of the cells have one allele inactive and the other 50% of the cells have the other allele inactive. However, studies have shown that skewed or nonrandom XCI is a biological plausibility wherein more than 75% of cells have the same allele inactive. Also, some of the X-chromosome genes escape XCI, i.e., both alleles are active in all cells. Current statistical tests for X-chromosome association studies can either account for random XCI (e.g., Clayton's approach) or escape from XCI (e.g., PLINK software). Because the true XCI process is unknown and differs across different regions on the X-chromosome, we proposed a unified approach of maximizing likelihood ratio over all biological possibilities: random XCI, skewed XCI, and escape from XCI. A permutation-based procedure was developed to assess the significance of the approach. We conducted simulation studies to compare the performance of the proposed approach with Clayton's approach and PLINK regression. The results showed that the proposed approach has higher powers in the scenarios where XCI is skewed while losing some power in scenarios where XCI is random or XCI is escaped, with well-controlled type I errors. We also applied the approach to the X-chromosomal genetic association study of head and neck cancer.
