{"id":89106,"title":"[Triple-Endobutton plates for the treatment of rockwood type III to V acromioclavicular joint dislocation].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical results of Triple-Endobutton plates for the treatment of Rockwood type III to V acromioclavicular joint dislocation.From March 2008 to June 2010,28 patients with Rockwood type II to V acromioclavicular joint dislocations were treated with Triple-Endobutton plates. There were 18 males and 10 females,ranging in age from 20 to 60 years old (averaged 38 years old). Twenty patients had dislocations in the left and 8 patients had dislocations in the right. All the patients had close injury. The Constant criterion was used to evaluate shoulder joint function.All the patients were followed up,and the duration ranged from 18 to 24 months,with an average of 20 months. All the patients got good shoulder joint function,and no re-dislocation and pain occurred. The X-ray showed all acromioclavicular joints got good reduction. According to Constant criterion,preoperative score was 25.4 +/- 2.0, postoperative scores were 65.9 +/- 3.0, 87.2 +/- 3.2 and 95.7+/- 1.6 at 1 month,3 months and 6 months separately.Treatment of Rockwood type III to V acromioclavicular joint dislocation with Triple-Endobutton plates has satisfactory clinical outcome, simple operation, few complications, without secondary operation and early functional exercise postoperatively.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754149","annotations":[{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.523998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acromioclavicular joint","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromioclavicular_joint"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Separated shoulder","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separated_shoulder"},{"name":"Good reduction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_reduction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Defensive back","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"The Constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constant"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"}]}
