{"id":81196,"title":"Upper midline deviation: modified Hyrax expander.","abstract":"The Hyrax rapid palatal expander is useful for patients in mixed dentition witht premature exfoliation of some deciduous teeth and maxillary hypoplasia. This appliance, which is provided of a vestibular arm for correcting maxillary asymmetric transverse discrepancies, represents an interceptive treatment able to reduce the duration of the orthodontic therapy with fixed appliances.In this case report the modified version of the Hyrax rapid palatal expander is described. The activation method, the therapeutic benefits as well as the clinical advantages are described.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299011","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.5019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.434902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.172396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0770068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Deciduous","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous"},{"name":"Palatal expander","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_expander"},{"name":"Maxillary hypoplasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_hypoplasia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"Mean line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_line"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Hyrax","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrax"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Vestibular","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"}]}
