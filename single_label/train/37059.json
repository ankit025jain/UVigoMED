{"id":37059,"title":"Incidence of morbidity and mortality in premature infants at the Department of Neonatal Intensive Care of Pediatric Clinic, Clinical Center of Sarajevo Unviersity.","abstract":"Premature baby (praematurus, neonatus praetemporarius) indicates infant that is born before 37 full weeks of gestation, calculated from the first day of the last mother's menstruation. Premature baby is characterized by immaturity of its organs and tissues, which can lead to an immediate or later threat. Premature children cannot keep the body temperature and very quickly gets hypothermia. This is due to the low creation of heat, but also because of the great loss of heat through the thin skin, which lacks fat. Nervous system in premature children is immature, and therefore has little control on breathing and often \"forget to breathe\". Also, they have underdeveloped reflexes, among other the feeding reflex.The main goal of the research was to show the incidence of hospitalization in premature infants during examined period, the most common complications and to show the degree of matureness. Also, during the research are presented and the frequency of premature born infant mortality.The study included a period of 6 months and was conducted at the Pediatric Clinic, Clinical Center University of Sarajevo. The clinical study included 81 premature newborns, which in the period from June 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012 hospitalized at the Department of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. On the basis of data from the history of the disease, were analyzed all newborns, gestation age, diagnosis for which they were hospitalized and flow with existing complications during treatment and recovery.In the second half of the 2012 at the Pediatric Clinic CCUS was hospitalized 81 premature born children. Gestational age ranged from 27 to 37 weeks and the body weight from 810 to 2500g. These children generally had respiratory problems during hospitalization and in nearly 1/3 of premature infants developed respiratory distress syndrome. In the study period there were 15 deaths in children whose average gestational age was 27 weeks and the body weight of 1050 grams.The incidence of premature infants and their mortality and morbidity has an important role in the provision of information needed to improve the health of pregnant women, mothers and newborns. It is also an important indicator of concern for the health of the mother and the quality of gynecological and pediatric care. Adequate approach to antenatal care and a high degree of frequency of neonatal care the premature delivery can be reduced and premature mortality minimized.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
