{"id":33893,"title":"[Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of the most common aneuploidies with cell-free fetal DNA in maternal serum--preliminary results].","abstract":"The aim of the study was to present initial results of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of common aneuploidies of chromosomes 21, 18 and 13 based on cell-free fetal DNA in maternal serum in high-risk patients, and to compare the results with routine karyotyping.Before the invasive procedure, 10 ml of peripheral blood from 10 patients was collected to isolate cell-free fetal DNA and to perform a non-invasive fetal trisomy test (NIFTY provided by Beijing Genomics Institute, BGI, Shenzen, China).Three out of 10 samples showed an abnormal karyotype in traditional karyotyping. There were 9 conclusive NIFTY results. NIFTY detected 1 out of 2 trisomies 18. The quantity of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma in the second probe with trisomy 18 was unsatisfactory fora conclusive NIFTY result. In 1 case traditional karyotyping revealed mosaicism impossible to detect with NIFTY","date":"2014-05-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783433","annotations":[{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Mosaic (genetics)","weight":0.843707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(genetics)"},{"name":"Edwards syndrome","weight":0.806344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_syndrome"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.34056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.32215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Shenzhen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen"},{"name":"Beijing Genomics Institute","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Genomics_Institute"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Internet forum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Nifty Fifty","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifty_Fifty"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"}]}
