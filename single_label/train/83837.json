{"id":83837,"title":"Outpatient follow-up versus 30-day readmission among general and vascular surgery patients: a case for redesigning transitional care.","abstract":"The association between early outpatient follow-up and 30-day readmission has not been evaluated in any surgical population. Our study characterizes the relationship between outpatient follow-up and early readmissions among surgical patients.We queried the medical record at a large, tertiary care institution (July 2008-December 2012) to determine rates of 30-day outpatient follow-up and readmission for general or vascular operative procedures.The majority of discharges for general (84% of 7,552) and vascular (75% of 2,362) surgery had a follow-up visit before readmission or within 30 days of discharge. General surgery patients who were not readmitted had high rates of follow-up (88%) and received follow-up at approximately 2 weeks postdischarge (median, 11 days after discharge). In contrast, readmitted general surgery patients received first follow-up at 1 week (median, 8 days); 49% had follow-up. Vascular surgery patients showed a similar trend. More than one half of patients readmitted after follow-up were readmitted within 24 hours of their most recent outpatient visit.Current routine follow-up does not occur early enough to detect adverse events and prevent readmission. Early outpatient care may prevent readmission in some patients, but often serves as a conduit for readmission among patients already experiencing complications.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239351","annotations":[{"name":"General surgery","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_surgery"},{"name":"Vascular surgery","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.671518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.626667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.572859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.424052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"362","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/362"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
