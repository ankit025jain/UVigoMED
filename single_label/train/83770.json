{"id":83770,"title":"Adipocyte lipolysis-stimulated interleukin-6 production requires sphingosine kinase 1 activity.","abstract":"Adipocyte lipolysis can increase the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) that promote insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms that link lipolysis with inflammation remain elusive. Acute activation of ?3-adrenergic receptors (ADRB3) triggers lipolysis and up-regulates production of IL-6 in adipocytes, and both of these effects are blocked by pharmacological inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase. We report that stimulation of ADRB3 induces expression of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and increases sphingosine 1-phosphate production in adipocytes in a manner that also depends on hormone-sensitive lipase activity. Mechanistically, we found that adipose lipolysis-induced SphK1 up-regulation is mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activating protein-1 signaling pathway. Inhibition of SphK1 by sphingosine kinase inhibitor 2 diminished the ADRB3-induced IL-6 production both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of IL-6 by ADRB3 activation was suppressed by siRNA knockdown of Sphk1 in cultured adipocytes and was severely attenuated in Sphk1 null mice. Conversely, ectopic expression of SphK1 increased IL-6 expression in adipocytes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that SphK1 is a critical mediator in lipolysis-triggered inflammation in adipocytes.
