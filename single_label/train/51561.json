{"id":51561,"title":"Contribution of subcutaneous abdominal fat on ultrasonography to carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Whereas visceral abdominal adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with cardiometabolic risk, there is debate regarding the role of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAT). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships of subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).A total of 234 patients (men 131, women 103, mean age: 53Â years) with T2DM were enrolled. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) and visceral fat thickness (VFT) were assessed by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography (US).Compared to women, men had significantly higher VFT and lower SFT (p?=?0.002, p?=?0.04, respectively). In partial correlation coefficient analyses between CIMT and abdominal fat thickness after adjustment for body mass index (BMI), SFT showed a negative correlation with CIMT in men (r?=?-0.27, p?=?0.03). VFT was not correlated with CIMT in either men or women. In women, SFT was not correlated with CIMT (r?=?-0.01, p?=?0.93). VFT/SFT ratio was not correlated with CIMT in either men or women. In multivariate regression analyses adjusted for BMI and other CVD risk factors, SFT but not VFT was independently inversely associated with CIMT in men but not in women (p?<?0.001).SFT assessed by US was inversely associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM, particularly men. Further research into the different roles of the two types of abdominal adipose tissue in both men and women is warranted.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678948","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Visceral fat","weight":0.573712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visceral_fat"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.566792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.510689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.488948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.457115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.456423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.449993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.33402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.236206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.212873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"SAT","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT"},{"name":"Value added tax","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0107573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
