{"id":92250,"title":"Emergency management of blunt chest trauma in children: an evidence-based approach.","abstract":"Pediatric trauma is commonly encountered in the emergency department, and trauma to the head, chest, and abdomen may be a source of significant morbidity and mortality. As children have unique thoracic anatomical and physiological properties, they may present with diagnostic challenges that the emergency clinician must be aware of. This review examines the effects of blunt trauma to the pediatric chest, as well as its relevant etiologies and associated mortality. Diagnostic and treatment options for commonly encountered injuries such as pulmonary contusions, rib fractures, and pneumothoraces are examined. Additionally, this review discusses rarely encountered--yet highly lethal--chest wall injuries such as blunt cardiac injuries, commotio cordis, nonaccidental trauma, and aortic injuries.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432505","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.793624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.721555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.656684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.607706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.571324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.562366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.316731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Chest trauma","weight":0.218205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_trauma"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.169826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Commotio cordis","weight":0.117303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commotio_cordis"},{"name":"Rib fracture","weight":0.0625525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_fracture"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
