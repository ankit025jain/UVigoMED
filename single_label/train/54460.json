{"id":54460,"title":"Safety and outcome of patients treated with a modified outpatient intraperitoneal regimen for epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.","abstract":"Despite the survival benefit of intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy observed in GOG172, significant toxicity and poor treatment completion rates have prevented the widespread acceptance of this regimen. Here, we report our experience with a modified outpatient GOG172 regimen.Eligible patients had stage III, optimally debulked epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer that underwent IP port placement for administration of a modified GOG172 regimen consisting of: (i) intravenous paclitaxel 135 mg/m² on day 1 over 3 h; (ii) intraperitoneal cisplatin 75 mg/m² on day 2, and (iii) intraperitoneal paclitaxel 60 mg/m² on day 8. Day 8 IP paclitaxel was omitted until tolerance of the first cycle of IP cisplatin had been established.Four or more cycles of IP chemotherapy were completed by 72.5% (29) of 40 eligible patients; 20% of patients exhibited catheter-related complications requiring port removal and discontinuation of IP chemotherapy. Grade 3-4 hematologic, metabolic and gastrointestinal toxicities occurred in 36, 8 and 21% of the patients, respectively. With a median follow-up of 47.7 months, progression-free and overall survival was comparable to GOG172.This modified outpatient GOG172 regimen is associated with less toxicity and improved completion rates compared to the original GOG172 regimen.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457572","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.909265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.847526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.719171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.692794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Primary peritoneal carcinoma","weight":0.692711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_peritoneal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.404782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.350523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.331176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Port","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"24 (season 8)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(season_8)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"}]}
