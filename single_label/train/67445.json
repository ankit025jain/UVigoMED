{"id":67445,"title":"[Cell-based therapy to treat stress urinary incontinence: which cell type at what cost?].","abstract":"In Germany, 6-8 million woman and men suffer urinary incontinence, which represents 12.5?% of the population. It is estimated that by the middle of this century, it will increase to almost 30?%. The primary reason will be primarily related to the aging population but also to patient awareness and seeking a solution. In addition to the cost which is covered by the health insurance, the patient will spend more than half a billion euro/year out-of-pocket, not to mention the social stigma associated with urinary incontinence. The current common treatment options are symptomatic but do not restore functionality. One option might be tissue engineering or stem cell therapy. This article describes the likelihood that this therapy will change the approach in treating stress urinary incontinence. Boundaries and legal aspects are highlighted as well as approximated cost. These treatment costs might be currently higher than the standard treatment options, but the investment to reduce these costs are paid indirectly by society.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615464","annotations":[{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.811497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.592295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.574209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.509893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.458948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Tissue engineering","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_engineering"},{"name":"Stem cell treatments","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_treatments"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.332234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.266854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.260156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.112558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Investment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"1000000000 (number)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number)"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Approximation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
