{"id":14898,"title":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha during neonatal brain development affects anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in adult male and female mice.","abstract":"A nascent literature suggests that neonatal infection is a risk factor for the development of brain, behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which can affect anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in later life. It has been documented that neonatal infection raises the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) in neonate rodents and such infections may result in neonatal brain injury, at least in part, through pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, previous studies have shown that TNF-? is involved in cellular differentiation, neurogenesis and programmed cell death during the development of the central nervous system. We investigated for the first time whether neonatal exposure to TNF-? can affect body weight, stress-induced corticosterone (COR), anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in adult mice. In the present study, neonatal mice were treated to recombinant mouse TNF-? (0.2, 0.4, 0.7 and 1 ?g/kg) or saline on postnatal days 3 and 5, then adult male and female mice were exposed to different behavioral tests. The results indicated that neonatal TNF-? treatment reduced body weight in neonatal period in both sexes. In addition, this study obtained some experimental findings indicating the high doses of TNF-? increase stress-induced COR levels, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in adult males, while decrease the levels of anxiety without any significant effect on depression in adult female mice. Our findings suggest that TNF-? exposure during neonatal period can alter brain and behavior development in a dose and sex-dependent manner in mice.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398264","annotations":[{"name":"Neurogenesis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.80702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.605897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.458083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.414837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.388064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.278632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.225154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.145444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0479663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Corticosterone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosterone"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
