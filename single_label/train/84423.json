{"id":84423,"title":"Effects of chaiyuwendan decoction on endocannabinoids levels in adipose tissue of rats with chronic stress-induced depression.","abstract":"To investigate how Chaiyuwendan decoction (CWD) affects endocannabinoid levels in the adipose tissue of depressed rats.Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups with six rats in each. One group was randomly selected as the control group. The remaining three groups were subjected to chronic stress to induce depression. Groups were randomly assigned as a model group, CWD group, and amitriptyline group. CWD was given to the CWD group once a day from the second day of modeling. The amitriptyline group was administered amitriptyline intragastrically (10 mg/kg) once a day. After treatment for 21 days, body weight and fat weight were measured and the levels of N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) in adipose tissue were determined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Compared with the control group, body weight, fat weight, AEA, and PEA were significantly lower, and 2-AG was higher, in the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, body weight, fat weight, the AEA, and PEA levels were significantly higher, and 2-AG level was significantly lower in the CWD group (P < 0.05). However, the levels did not differ significantly between the CWD group and the amitriptyline group.CWD could regulate the levels of AEA, 2-AG, and PEA in rats with depression induced by chronic stress.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102698","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Amitriptyline","weight":0.525095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.507719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.460158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.332851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Endocannabinoid","weight":0.256011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Decoction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoction"},{"name":"Chronic stress","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Aktiengesellschaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"},{"name":"Anandamide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Chronic wasting disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wasting_disease"}]}
