{"id":44816,"title":"IL-18 promoter -137G/C polymorphism correlates with chronic hepatitis B and affects the expression of interleukins.","abstract":"The relationship between the interleukin (IL)-18 promoter -137G/C polymorphism and plasma levels of IL-18, IL-12, IL-4, and IFN-? in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and healthy subjects was investigated. The polymorphism was genotyped by a ligase detection reaction-PCR (LDR-PCR), while the cytokines were assayed by ELISA. Compared with healthy subjects, CHB patients exhibited an increased frequency of the G allele, GG genotype and increased IL-4 levels, but decreased levels of IL-18, IL-12, and IFN-?. A positive correlation for IL-18 ~ IL-12 ~ IFN-? and a negative correlation for IL-18 ~ IL-4 were found. We conclude that the IL-18 promoter -137G polymorphisms correlated with CHB infection and influenced the expression of IL-18. The studied interleukins represent an immunomodulatory network that plays important roles in host immune responses to CHB infection.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717026","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.851443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.655626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.617601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.559674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.490129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.488503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.39873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Interleukin 18","weight":0.231987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_18"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.0501171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Ligase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligase"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
