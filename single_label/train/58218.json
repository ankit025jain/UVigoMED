{"id":58218,"title":"Psoriasis in children and women: addressing some special needs.","abstract":"Psoriasis is a lifelong, chronic disease that affects all ages. For some, psoriasis begins in childhood, and education of both pediatric patients and their parents is essential to successful and safe disease management. Systemic treatment of children is challenging as no evidence-based guidelines have been developed to date. When treating women with psoriasis, clinicians should also consider psychosocial effects. In patients of childbearing age, treatment options depend on the patients' choices regarding pregnancy.
