{"id":68822,"title":"A perspective on anti-CCN2 therapy for chronic kidney disease.","abstract":"Kidney fibrosis is the common end point of chronic kidney disease independent of aetiology. Currently, no effective therapy exists to reduce kidney fibrosis. CCN2 appears to be an interesting candidate for anti-fibrotic drug targeting, because it holds a central position in the development of kidney fibrosis and interacts with a variety of factors that are involved in the fibrotic response, including transforming growth factor (TGF) ? and Bone morphogenetic proteins. Although CCN2 modifies many pathways, it does not appear to have a membrane receptor of its own. Numerous experimental and clinical studies lowering CCN2 bioavailability have shown promising results with minimal adverse side effects. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of CCN2 research with a focus on anti-fibrotic therapy.
