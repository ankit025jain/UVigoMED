{"id":54032,"title":"MicroRNA-375 targets PDK1 in pancreatic carcinoma and suppresses cell growth through the Akt signaling pathway.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are believed to have great potential for use as molecular targets in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-375 is downregulated in pancreatic carcinoma (PC) tissues and PC cell lines. We found that miR-375 negatively regulates the expression of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) by directly targeting the 3'UTR of the PDK1 transcript. To investigate the biological roles and the potential mechanisms of action of miR?375, we induced either the up- or downregulation of miR-375 expression by transfecting various PC cells with miR-375 mimics or an inhibitor. Our results revealed that the upregulation of miR-375 inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis, while the downregulation of miR-375 with the inhibitor had the opposite effect. In addition, our data demonstrate that miR-375 suppresses the malignant behavior of PC cells through the Akt signaling pathway rather than mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings indicate that targeting miR-375 by a genetic approach may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of PC.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481267","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.879672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.802668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.620071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.619484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.510047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"PDK1","weight":0.478217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDK1"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.475778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"}]}
