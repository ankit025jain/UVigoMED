{"id":41222,"title":"The pattern of surgically treatable anorectal diseases in University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Rivers State, Nigeria.","abstract":"Disorders of the anus and rectum occurcommonly in surgical practice. Common anorectal disorders include haemorrhoids, carcinoma of the rectum, anal fissures, anorectal fistulae and abscesses. Less frequently encountered disorders include perineal injuries, anal cancers and rectal polyps. The purpose of this study is to determine the pattern of anorectal diseases which were surgically treated in University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital.This is a 4 year retrospective study of all adult patients with anorectal diseases who were admitted into the surgical wards of University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital. Relevant data were retrieved and analyzed.One hundred and fifty cases were seen over the 4 year period. There were 92 (61.33%) males and 58 (38.67%) females making a male to female ratio of 1.6:1. The peak age incidence was 31-40 years. The commonest anorectal disorder was haemorrhoids. Other commonly encountered conditions in decreasing order were carcinoma of the rectum, anorectal fistulae, anal fissures and rectal prolapsed. Five patients died and they all had carcinoma of the rectum.Haemorrhoids remain the commonest anorectal disorder in University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital. Carcinoma of the rectum which was not noted among the studied population in ourcentre 10 years ago now assumes the second position and this reflects an increasing incidence of the disease. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are imperative for increase in survival rate.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946456","annotations":[{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Hemorrhoid","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.65997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.525721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Trans woman","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0347132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"River","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Anal fissure","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_fissure"},{"name":"Fissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure"}]}
