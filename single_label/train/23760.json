{"id":23760,"title":"[Analysis of actual effects of combining xiyanping injection with vitamin C injection in treatment of upper respiratory tract infection].","abstract":"To investigate whether Xiyanping injection associated with vitamin C injection will improve the cure rate of upper respiratory tract infection compared to treatment with Xiyanping injection alone.The analysis was based on hospital information system (HIS) data. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether he or she accepted the addition of vitamin C to treatment with Xiyanping injection. We used the propensity score to balance confounding factors, and made confounding factors which cannot be balanced by the propensity score to act as covariate variables. Then Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two groups.There was no significant difference between the 2 groups.Compared with Xiyanping injection alone, using vitamin C in combination does not improve the treatment effectiveness of upper respiratory tract infection.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471345","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.315391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract infection","weight":0.309824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.293195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.269237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.153973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.147269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract","weight":0.098014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Hospital information system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_information_system"},{"name":"Covariate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariate"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Information system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"}]}
