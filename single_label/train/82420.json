{"id":82420,"title":"[Individual and contextual determinants of dental caries in Brazilian 12-year-olds in 2010].","abstract":"To estimate the prevalence and severity of dental caries in Brazilian children and the association with individual and contextual factors.Data were taken from the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil 2010) a sample of 7,247 12-year-olds. The data were collected using clinical examinations and interviews. The dependent variables were the prevalence of dental caries (decayed, missing and filled teeth [DMFT] ? 1 and DMFT ? 4). Bivariate (Rao Scott test) and multivariate (Poisson regression) analyses were carried out. The individual variables were sociodemographic variables, periodontal health and reporting discomfort while brushing. Contextual factors were the presence of water fluoridation, the percentage of residences connected to the water supply and median income of the municipality.The prevalence of DMFT ? 1 was 56.0%. Mean DMFT was 2.04 (95%CI 1.76;2.31) and 22.2% of children had DMFT ? 4. Caries experience was significantly more common in children with black, brown or yellow skin; in low-income families; in children with dental calculus or bleeding gums and in those who reported discomfort while brushing. Living in towns with fluoridated tap water, with low coverage of water supply and with low median income were contextual factors associated with the disease.The prevalence of dental caries in Brazilian 12-year-olds was low, according to World Health Organization criteria. There were significant geographical and socioeconomic inequalities in levels of the disease.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic
