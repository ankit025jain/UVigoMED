{"id":67894,"title":"Renal denervation: a novel non-pharmacological approach in heart failure.","abstract":"Heart failure is associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system which presumably results in a progression of the syndrome and thereby in poor outcome. Renal denervation has shown to be effective in conditions with enhanced sympathetic activity like resistant hypertension and metabolic syndrome associated with sleep apnea. The first pilot trials assessing the effect of renal denervation on signs and symptoms of heart failure in patients with both preserved and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are presently ongoing. The results of these studies will determine whether to proceed with larger prospective outcome trials. Altogether, renal denervation is a promising novel technique that may improve the outcome of patients with sympathetic hyperactivity and cardiovascular diseases.
