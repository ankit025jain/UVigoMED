{"id":23171,"title":"Cutaneous blastomycosis masquerading as pyoderma gangrenosum.","abstract":"Cutaneous blastomycosis (CB) is associated with a variety of skin manifestations. Among other entities, CB may be mistaken for pyoderma gangrenosum due to overlap of findings on histopathologic examination. We report a case of CB, initially diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum and treated with steroids, leading to disseminated blastomycosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
