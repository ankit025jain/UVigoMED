{"id":27828,"title":"[Ketamine: psychiatric indications and misuses].","abstract":"Ketamine or -ketamine hydrochloride- is used as an anesthesic and a painkiller. It may also, in some indications, be prescribed in psychiatry and addictology. A literature review was conducted from 2003 to 2013, in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Psyclnfo, using the following key words (alone or combined): \"ketamine\", \"abuse\", \"addiction\", \"dependence\" and \"misuse\". Various studies have shown the benefit of k√©tamine in some psychiatric conditions such as major depressive episodes and electroconvulsive therapy. Others have demonstrated beneficial effects in alcohol or opiate abstinence maintenance. Ketamine seems to be a promising molecule in psychiatry and in the treatment of addictions, despite the absence of marketing approval for those specific uses. Being a strong psycho-stimulant, ketamine can be the source of abuse and dependence with somatic, psychiatric and cognitive complications.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158385","annotations":[{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Ketamine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine"},{"name":"Electroconvulsive therapy","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy"},{"name":"Opiate","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.823181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.631347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Marketing","weight":0.245517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"},{"name":"Major depressive episode","weight":0.144821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_episode"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Approved drug","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approved_drug"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Scholar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}]}
