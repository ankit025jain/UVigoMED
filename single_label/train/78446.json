{"id":78446,"title":"Severe auditory processing disorder secondary to viral meningoencephalitis.","abstract":"To describe auditory function in an individual with bilateral damage to the temporal and parietal cortex.Case report.A previously healthy 17-year old male is described who sustained extensive cortical injury following an episode of viral meningoencephalitis. He developed status epilepticus and required intubation and multiple anticonvulsants.Serial brain MRIs showed bilateral temporoparietal signal changes reflecting extensive damage to language areas and the first transverse gyrus of Heschl on both sides. The patient was referred for assessment of auditory processing but was so severely impaired in speech processing that he was unable to complete any formal tests of his speech processing abilities. Audiological assessment utilizing objective measures of auditory function established the presence of normal peripheral auditory function and illustrates the importance of the use of objective measures of auditory function in patients with injuries to the auditory cortex.Use of objective measures of auditory function is essential in establishing the presence of normal peripheral auditory function in individuals with cortical damage who may not be able to cooperate sufficiently for assessment utilizing behavioral measures of auditory function.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665836","annotations":[{"name":"Parietal lobe","weight":0.840445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe"},{"name":"Status epilepticus","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_epilepticus"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.754141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Primary auditory cortex","weight":0.614004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_auditory_cortex"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.58092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.558538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.540941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.496248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.461082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.409082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.301363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Auditory processing disorder","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_processing_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Inferior frontal gyrus","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_frontal_gyrus"},{"name":"Gyrus","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrus"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Speech processing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_processing"},{"name":"Meningoencephalitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningoencephalitis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Language center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_center"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Information processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
