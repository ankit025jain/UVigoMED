{"id":63352,"title":"[The influence of consecutive application of radioprotector B-190 and interleukin-1beta on changes of number of peripheral blood leucocytes and functional status of neutrophils of irradiated mice].","abstract":"The estimation of efficiency of consecutive application of radioprotector B-190 and interleukin-1beta administered at early times after acute irradiation by studying the changes of the number of peripheral blood leukocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes, as well as cytochemical research into the contents of glycogen, myeloperoxidase and alkaline phosphatase in neutrophils of the irradiated mice was carried out. It is established that administration of radioprotector B-190 at a doze of 50 mg/kg for 15 minutes before irradiation and interleukin-1beta at a doze of 50 mkg/kg for 15 minutes after irradiation reduces the expressiveness of post-irradiation leukopenia, accelerates restoration of the number of neutrophils and lymphocytes in peripheral blood, normalizes the functional status of neutrophils of irradiated mice to a greater degree than their isolated introduction.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450210","annotations":[{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Glycogen","weight":0.75224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.729078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.554984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.531421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.447037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.422206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.359069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.302141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Expressivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressivity"},{"name":"Normalization (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)"},{"name":"Beechcraft 1900","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_1900"}]}
