{"id":72015,"title":"Effect of anaesthetic technique on the natural killer cell anti-tumour activity of serum from women undergoing breast cancer surgery: a pilot study.","abstract":"Animal models and retrospective clinical data suggest that certain anaesthetic techniques can attenuate immunosuppression and minimize metastasis after cancer surgery. Natural killer (NK) T cells are a critical component of the anti-tumour immune response. We investigated the effect of serum from women undergoing primary breast cancer surgery, randomized to propofol-paravertebral block (PPA) or sevoflurane-opioid (GA) anaesthetic techniques, on healthy human donor NK cell function and cytotoxicity against oestrogen and progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer cells (HCC1500).Serum from PPA subjects did not alter normal NK marker expression or secretion of cytokines. Serum from GA subjects reduced NK cell activating receptor CD16 [from mean (sem), 82 (2)% to 50 (4)%, P=0.001], IL-10 [from 1700 (80) to 1200 (92) pg ml(-1), P=0.001], and IL-1? [from 68 (12) to 19 (4) pg ml(-1), P=0.01]. An increase in NK cell CD107a [23 (2)% to 37(3)%, P=0.007] and apoptosis of HCC1500 [11 (1)% to 21 (2)%, P=0.0001] was observed with PPA serum, but not GA serum, treated NK cells.Serum from women with breast cancer undergoing surgical excision who were randomized to receive a PPA anaesthetic technique led to greater human donor NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro compared with serum from women who received GA.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009196","annotations":[{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.897476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.699349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.622433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.582708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.254364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.21479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.204537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
