{"id":73856,"title":"Simple technique for reconstruction of superior vena cava and brachiocephalic vein after removal for thoracic malignancies.","abstract":"A ringed polytetrafluoroethylene graft was applied to reduce clamping time for a patent major vein. In case 1, after suturing the ringed graft to the right appendage, the other end was inserted in the distal direction of the left brachiocephalic vein and secured by ligation. In case 2, to repair an extensive superior vena cava defect, the graft was wrapped with the remnant venous wall and fixed with a continuous suture. Only 5 minutes were required to reconstruct the left brachiocephalic vein and 20 minutes for the superior vena cava. Long-term graft patency was obtained without thrombosis.
