{"id":72733,"title":"Development of the Pediatric Advanced Care Quality of Life Scale (PAC-QoL): evaluating comprehension of items and response options.","abstract":"Validated tools that measure quality of life (QOL) for children with poor prognosis malignancies are not available. We are developing a novel instrument, The Pediatric Advanced Care-Quality of Life Scale (PAC-QoL), in order to address this gap. Instrument development requires a phase of item reduction and assessment of item comprehension in the target population. This manuscript provides a report on this phase in the development of the PAC-QoL.Children with poor prognosis cancer and/or their parents were invited to participate in cognitive probing interviews. Participants' understanding of each item was rated from 0 (did not understand) to 4 (completely understood). To evaluate the response scale, an overall percentage of respondents' ability to accurately distinguish between the four response options was calculated.Four age- and reporter-specific versions of the PAC-QoL were tested with 74 participants. Mean (±SD) comprehension scores across versions ranged from 3.40?±?.0.30 (child self-report) to 3.69?±?0.23 (parent of toddler report). The number of items deleted or modified to improve understandability ranged from 46% of all items on the parent-of-child report to 56% for the child and adolescent self-reports. Respondent's abilities to accurately distinguish between response-scale options ranged from 84% (child-report) to 98% (parent-toddler report).We demonstrate a high degree item understandability and response-scale separation in the current version of the PAC-QoL. The scale is ready for psychometric evaluation in its target population.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947009","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.723185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.64065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.454937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.449271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.35966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.348449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.306273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Legal separation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_separation"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Child and adolescent psychiatry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_and_adolescent_psychiatry"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
