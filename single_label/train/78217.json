{"id":78217,"title":"[Preliminary analysis of SPT tests on 5,843 allergic rhinitis patients from south Shanghai area].","abstract":"To explore the distribution of allergen tested by skin prick test (SPT) in about 5,843 allergic rhinitis patients in south Shanghai.SPT test was conducted in 5,843 allergic rhinitis patients who came to our clinic from January 2007 to August 2012. The result was analyzed by age, sex and year.The top three allergens by percentage are dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, dermatophagoides culinae and fungus among 15 common allergens. Incidence rate between male and female in each year had statistical significance, both of which showed no increasing trend with year. Incidence rates among different age groups aging from 6 to 17 years' old had no statistically significant difference, but statistically significant difference among different age groups existed in other age groups. Incidence rate showed increasing trend with year in age group of 40-65, which was not observed in other groups. The incidence rate showed decreasing trend with age in male and female, while the incidence rate in male was always higher than female.In south Shanghai, primary allergens causing allergic rhinitis are dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, dermatophagoides culinae and fungus. Statistically significant difference about allergic rhinitis existed in age and sex. SPT has important significance in diagnosis of allergens.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738313","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.658449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.531277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.0727563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.0409614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"House dust mite","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dust_mite"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"843","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/843"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Bear market","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_market"},{"name":"Strathclyde Partnership for Transport","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathclyde_Partnership_for_Transport"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
