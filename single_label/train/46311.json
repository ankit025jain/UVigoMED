{"id":46311,"title":"Radiofrequency ablation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: feasability, local tumor control, and long-term outcome.","abstract":"A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) was performed. Seven patients with 9 tumors underwent RFA. The mean tumor size was 2.4 cm (range=1.3-3.3 cm). RFA achieved technique effectiveness and local tumor control in 89% (8/9 tumors) of the patients respectively, with a mean overall survival of 38.5 months (range=12-69 months). To conclude, RFA was effective in achieving local tumor control and may offer a therapeutic option for patients with recurrent or primary IHCC.
