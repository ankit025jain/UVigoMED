{"id":46854,"title":"CT features of groove pancreatitis subtypes.","abstract":"Groove pancreatitis is a rare form of chronic pancreatitis affecting the pancreaticoduodenal groove, a potential space bordered by the pancreatic head, duodenum and common bile duct. Two forms of groove pancreatitis have been described: the segmental form, which involves the groove and the pancreatic head; and the pure form, which affects the groove only. Differentiation between groove pancreatitis and pancreatic head carcinoma can be difficult, both clinically and radiologically. In this article we present the clinical and imaging findings of two patients with pure and segmental groove pancreatitis respectively.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617180","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.61666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.461358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.35179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.343985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0353015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Groove (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music)"},{"name":"Potential space","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_space"}]}
