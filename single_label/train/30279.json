{"id":30279,"title":"Deep accidental hypothermia with core temperature below 24°c presenting with vital signs.","abstract":"According to the Swiss hypothermia clinical staging, patients with stage III are unconscious with preserved vital signs, with core temperature usually between 24° and 28°C. With stage IV, vital signs are absent with core temperature <24°C.To describe a patient presenting with HT stage III with vital signs but a core temperature of <24°C, and to search for similar patients in the medical literature.MEDLINE was used to search for cases of deep accidental hypothermia (<24°C) and preserved vital signs.We found 22 cases in addition to our case (n=23). Median age was 44 years (IQR 36; range 4-83) and median core temperature 22°C (IQR 1.7; 17-23.8). Vital signs were often minimal. Seven patients developed ventricular fibrillation (VF). Twenty patients survived with excellent neurological outcome.Vital signs can be present in hypothermic patients with core temperature <24°C. In deeply hypothermic patients, a careful check and prolonged check of vital functions should be made, as vital signs may be minimal. The clinical Swiss staging remains valuable in the prehospital evaluation of hypothermic patients; its correlation with core temperature should be better defined.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527793","annotations":[{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.6682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Unconsciousness","weight":0.383206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.307944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Ventricular fibrillation","weight":0.265579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.238129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.0612518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0495881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Normal human body temperature","weight":0.0170442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_human_body_temperature"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"1723","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1723"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"}]}
