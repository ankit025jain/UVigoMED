{"id":52023,"title":"Barringtonia acutangula improves the biochemical parameters in diabetic rats.","abstract":"This study was aimed at evaluating the anti-diabetic activity of the ethanol and aqueous extracts of the leaf material of Barringtonia acutangula in a diabetic animal model.The ethanolic and aqueous extracts (250 and 500 mg·kg(-1) body weight) of the leaves of B. acutangula were assessed for antidiabetic activity in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes animal model following 21 days of treatment. Glibenclamide (0.6 mg·kg(-1) p.o.) was used as a positive control. The hematological parameters, such as blood glucose level, urea, creatinin, cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels were examined.An acute toxicity study (5 000 mg·kg(-1), p.o.) did not produce any symptoms of toxicity. Significant reductions in blood glucose level, and serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were noted in animals treated with the extract. The high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLC) level was found to increase as compared with the diabetic control group.These results suggest that the leaf aqueous and ethanolic extracts of B. acutangula have anti-diabetic effects. The aqueous extract of B. acutangula produced a similar effect when compared with the ethanol extract. It is proposed that consumption of B. acutangula in some form like tea may help the management of diabetes.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636063","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.695645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Tea","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.459022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.444083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.369979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glibenclamide","weight":0.364904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibenclamide"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.336233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.3165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
