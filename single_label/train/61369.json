{"id":61369,"title":"The temporary use of thrombopoietin-receptor agonists may induce a prolonged remission in adult chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Results of a French observational study.","abstract":"Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (Tpo-RAs) are highly effective in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Recently, cases of durable remission after Tpo-RA discontinuation in adult ITP have been reported. We aimed to describe the subset of patients in whom transient Tpo-RA therapy may induce a durable response. We studied all adults with primary ITP treated with at least one Tpo-RA over a 5-year period (n = 54) and seen at one of three participating referral centres in France. Tpo-RAs were discontinued in 20 of 28 patients who achieved a complete response. We excluded six patients because a previous treatment at the start of Tpo-RA treatment may have interfered with the response. Overall, eight patients with chronic ITP showed a sustained response [median follow-up: 13·5 months (range 5-27 months)]. We could not identify a predictive factor of sustained response. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of ITP patients receiving Tpo-RAs can maintain a durable response after treatment discontinuation.
