{"id":17649,"title":"Acquired echinocandin resistance in a Candida krusei blood isolate confirmed by mutations in the fks1 gene.","abstract":"We describe a case of bloodstream infection caused by a Candida krusei strain that developed echinocandin resistance during caspofungin therapy. Three mutations were found in the HS1 region of the fks1 gene, two of them have never been reported either in C. krusei nor in C. albicans.
