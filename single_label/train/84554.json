{"id":84554,"title":"Addressing non-communicable diseases in Malaysia: an integrative process of systems and community.","abstract":"The prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and NCD risk factors in Malaysia have risen substantially in the last two decades. The Malaysian Ministry of Health responded by implementing, \"The National Strategic Plan for Non-Communicable Diseases (NSP-NCD) 2010-2014\", and the \"NCD Prevention 1Malaysia\" (NCDP-1M) programme. This paper outlines the primary health system context in which the NCDP-1M is framed. We also discuss the role of community in facilitating the integration of this programme, and outline some of the key challenges in addressing the sustainability of the plan over the next few years. The paper thus provides an analysis of an integration of a programme that involved a multi-sectoral approach with the view to contributing to a broader discourse on the development of responsive health systems.
