{"id":68867,"title":"Health care service utilization among patients with bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis in a single payer healthcare system.","abstract":"This study aims to investigate the differences in the utilization of healthcare services between patients with bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) and patients without using a population-based database in Taiwan.This study comprised of 350 patients with BPS/IC and 1,750 age-matched controls. Healthcare resource utilization was evaluated in the one-year follow-up period as follows: number of outpatient visits and inpatient days, and the mean costs of outpatient and inpatient treatment. A multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between BPS/IC and total costs of health care services.For urological services, patients with BPS/IC had a significantly higher number of outpatient visits (2.5 vs. 0.2, p<0.001) as well as significantly higher outpatient costs ($US166 vs. $US6.8, p<0.001) than the controls. For non-urologic services, patients with BPS/IC had a significantly high number of outpatient visits (35.0 vs. 21.3, p<0.001) as well as significantly higher outpatient cots ($US912 vs. $US675, p<0.001) as compared to the controls. Overall, patients with BPS/IC had 174% more outpatient visits and 150% higher total costs than the controls. Multiple-regression-analyses also showed that the patients with BPS/IC had significantly higher total costs for all healthcare services than the controls.This study found that patients with BPS/IC have a significantly higher number of healthcare related visits, and have significantly higher healthcare related costs than age-matched controls. The high level of healthcare services utilization accrued with BPS/IC was not necessarily exclusive for BPS/IC, but may have also been associated with medical co-morbidities.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24489932","annotations":[{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.632809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.380612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Single-payer health care","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_health_care"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.277943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.217537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.176213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.121605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Inpatient care","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient_care"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Cystitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystitis"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"912","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/912"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"In-situ resource utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-situ_resource_utilization"},{"name":"Camp bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_bed"}]}
