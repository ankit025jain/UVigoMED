{"id":38728,"title":"The protein kinases TPL2 and EGFR contribute to ERK1/ERK2 hyperactivation in CFTR?F508-expressing airway epithelial cells exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abstract":"Excessive inflammation and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection are two major characteristics of cysticfibrosis (CF) lung disease. In this manuscript, we describe a novel mechanism of ERK1/ERK2 activationand CXCL8 expression in airway epithelial cells (AECs) lacking functional CFTR. In both non-CF and CFAECs, the protein kinase TPL2 is required for ERK1/ERK2 MAPK activation. However, we have found that EGFR is strongly phosphorylated in the airway epithelium of CF lung and contributes to ERK1/ERK2 MAPK activation in CF AECs exposed to P. aeruginosa diffusible material (PsaDM). Moreover, PsaDM stimulates the expression of the EGFR pro-ligand HB-EGF more strongly, and in a sustained manner, in CF AECs compared to non-CF cells. Finally, although both non-CF and CF AECs expresses CXCL8 in response to PsaDM, the levels of CXCL8 are higher and EGFR plays a more important role in regulating CXCL8 synthesis in CF AECs. Together, our finding shows that in addition to the TLR-mediated TPL2 activation of ERK1/ERK2, an additional pathway contributing to ERK1/ERK2 activation is triggered by infection of CF AECs: the EGFR signaling pathway. This second pathway may contribute to excessive inflammation observed in CF.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24404585","annotations":[{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.902668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.666285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.521623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","weight":0.482907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.429766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"MAPK1","weight":0.410886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK1"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.30201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Respiratory epithelium","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_epithelium"},{"name":"Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin-binding_EGF-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"MAPK3","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK3"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"}]}
