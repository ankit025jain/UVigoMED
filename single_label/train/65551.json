{"id":65551,"title":"[Comparation of the transperitoneal and extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy].","abstract":"To compare the transperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy procedures with extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy procedures to assess for differences in outcomes and complications.A retrospective review 190 patients who had received laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer from June 2002 to January 2013. The results were compared between 116 transperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy procedures and 74 extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy procedures.The cohorts were similar in terms of mean patient age, height, weight, body mass index, Gleason score from biopsy, and clinical stage. Patients receiced extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy had shorter operation time (146 minutes vs. 224 minutes, Z = -7.220, P = 0.000), less postoperative drainage time (3 days vs. 7 days, Z = -7.115, P = 0.000) and shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (5 days vs. 10 days, Z = -7.250, P = 0.000) than patients receiced transperitoneal procedures. However, the Gleason score, pathological stage, positive margin rate, intraoperative and early postoperative complications has no differences between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).The patients who received extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy had shorter operative time and revovered faster recovery and the effect of surgery was similar.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809524","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.786476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.634161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.516275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.431707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.417791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.325947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.155994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.100451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0314217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/224"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
