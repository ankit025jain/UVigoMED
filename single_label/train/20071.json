{"id":20071,"title":"Clinical results after arthroscopic treatment for septic arthritis of the elbow joint.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine clinical findings of septic arthritis of the elbow joint in a series of immunocompetent patients and to evaluate the outcomes after arthroscopic treatment.Between October 2006 and January 2012, 11 patients with septic arthritis of the elbow underwent arthroscopic surgery. History, laboratory findings, and radiologic findings were reviewed. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS).The study included 5 men and 6 women with a mean age of 45 years. An underlying medical disease was present in 1 patient (diabetes). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism identified (5 patients). There was 1 reoperation and no complications related to the arthroscopic procedure. Eight of 11 patients had excellent results assessed by MEPS at the final follow-up. The mean MEPS was 94.5 at the final follow-up.Septic arthritis of the elbow joint can occur in otherwise healthy patients without pre-existing elbow disease. Arthroscopic irrigation and synovectomy are safe and effective in patients with septic arthritis and result in good functional outcomes.Level IV, therapeutic case series.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680322","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.80264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.642946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.621664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.33045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.118033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Synovectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovectomy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"}]}
