{"id":74018,"title":"GPER mediates enhanced cell viability and motility via non-genomic signaling induced by 17?-estradiol in triple-negative breast cancer cells.","abstract":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer with a generally poor prognosis. Due to lack of specific targets for its treatment, an efficient therapy is needed. G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a novel estrogen receptor, has been reported to be expressed in TNBC tissues. In this study, we investigated the effects of blocking non-genomic signaling mediated by the estrogen/GPER pathway on cell viability and motility in the TNBC cells. GPER was strongly expressed in the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-436, and the estrogen-mediated non-genomic ERK signaling activated by GPER was involved in cell viability and motility of TNBC cells. Treatment with 17?-estradiol (E2), the GPER-specific agonist G-1 and tamoxifen (TAM) led to rapid activation of p-ERK1/2, but not p-Akt. Moreover, estrogen/GPER/ERK signaling was involved in increasing cell growth, survival, and migration/invasion by upregulating expression of cyclinA, cyclinD1, Bcl-2, and c-fos associated with the cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of TNBC specimens showed a significantly different staining of p-ERK1/2 between GPER-positive tissues (58/66, 87.9%) and GPER-negative tissues (13/30, 43.3%). The positivity of GPER and p-ERK1/2 displayed a strong association with large tumor size and poor clinical stage, indicating that GPER/ERK signaling might also contribute to tumor progression in TNBC patients which corresponded with in vitro experimental data. Our findings suggest that inhibition of estrogen/GPER/ERK signaling represents a novel targeted therapy in TNBC.
