{"id":86821,"title":"[The acquired overt cytomegalovirus infection (primary form and reactivation) in adult immune safety patients].","abstract":"The analysis was applied to clinical course of disease in 102 patients with acquired overt cytomegalovirus infection (75 patients with primary form, 27 patients with reactivation). The primary form of acquired overt cytomegalovirus infection was identified on the basis of detection in enzymoimmunoassay of CMV-lgM under negative CMV-IgG or CMV-IgM and CMV-IgG with avidity less that 50%. The reactivation was diagnosed under identification of CMV-IgG with avidity 50% and more with low indicators of CMV-IgM. The acquired overt cytomegalovirus infection occurs more often in males of young age and proceeds mainly in generalized medium severe form with fever, intoxication and hepatosplenomegaly. The clinical differences are limited by higher rate of generalized forms of disease, febrile fever, weakness, hepatomegaly with increasing of activity of aminotransferase of blood serum, manifestation of signs of affection of respiratory tracts and increase of number of atypical mononuclear leukocytes of peripheral blood in patients with primary form of acquired overt cytomegalovirus infection as compared with reactivated infection.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552054","annotations":[{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Hepatomegaly","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatomegaly"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.658329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.589659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.520579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Hepatosplenomegaly","weight":0.516591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatosplenomegaly"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Mononuclear leukocytes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononuclear_leukocytes"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Affection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Avidity","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidity"}]}
