{"id":21069,"title":"[Two spondylodiscitis due to a contamination by Brucella melitensis in a mother and daughter back from holidays].","abstract":"We describe here a case of spondylodiscitis of brucellosis origin in one patient back from Turkey. Some weeks later, her mother, who had accompagnied her in Turkey also developped similar symptoms. A diagnosis of spondylodiscitis due to a contamination by Brucella melitensis was also proposed. Since the control of animal brucellosis in Europe, human cases are rarer. Sporadic cases still observed are mostly travellers back from aerea where animal brucellosis remains endemic. Seroprevalence of a second case of brucellosis among family members of a patient with brucellosis is significantly more elevated than in the general population. This justifies early detection among family members presenting with any medical symptom, in order to avoid chronicity. Early detection among asymptomatic family members is not clearly justified.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624738","annotations":[{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.673109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.523819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.36631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.336161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.330939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Brucellosis","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucellosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.155832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Brucella melitensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucella_melitensis"},{"name":"Spondylodiscitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylodiscitis"},{"name":"Brucella","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucella"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Holiday","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
