{"id":81337,"title":"Randomized controlled clinical trial of long-term chemo-mechanical caries removal using Papacarie™ gel.","abstract":"Compare the effectiveness of Papacarie™ gel for the chemo-mechanical removal of carious lesions on primary teeth to conventional caries removal with a low-speed bur with regard to execution time, clinical aspects and radiographic findings.A randomized controlled clinical trial with a split-mouth design was carried out. The sample was composed of 20 children aged four to seven years, in whom 40 deciduous teeth were randomly divided into two groups: chemo-mechanical caries removal with Papacarie™ and removal of carious dentin with a low-speed bur. Each child underwent both procedures and served as his/her own control. Restorations were performed with glass ionomer cement. The time required to perform the procedure was also analyzed. The patients underwent longitudinal clinical and radiographic follow-up of the restorations.No statistically significant difference between groups was found regarding the time required to perform the procedures and the radiographic follow up. Statistically significant differences between groups were found in the clinical evaluation at 6 and 18 months after treatment.Papacarie™ is as effective as the traditional method for the removal of carious dentin on deciduous teeth, but offers the advantages of the preservation of sound dental tissue as well as the avoidance of sharp rotary instruments and local anesthesia.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141203","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.782577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.579852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.494426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.44239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.320616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.286869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.142916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ionomer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionomer"},{"name":"Glass ionomer cement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_ionomer_cement"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Sparkling wine production","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_wine_production"},{"name":"Bur","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bur"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
