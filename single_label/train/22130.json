{"id":22130,"title":"[Prognostic values of serum procalcitonin level and pediatric critical illness score in children with sepsis].","abstract":"To investigate the correlation between serum procalcitonin (PCT) level and pediatric critical illness score (PCIS) and their prognostic values in children with sepsis.Sixty-one children with sepsis in the pediatric intensive care unit were enrolled. According to PCIS, these patients were divided into non-critical (n=18), critical (n=20), and extremely critical groups (n=23). Within 24 hours after admission, serum levels of PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactic acid (LA) and routine blood counts were measured. These parameters were compared between the three groups. The Pearson correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation of PCT with PCIS and other serological parameters. Based on clinical outcomes, these patients were divided into survival (n=39) and death groups (n=22). The PCT, PCIS, and other serological parameters were compared between the two groups.The serum levels of PCT and CRP in the non-critical group were significantly lower than those in critical group and extremely critical groups (P<0.05), and the two parameters were significantly lower in the critical group than in the extremely critical groups (P<0.05). The extremely critical group had a significantly higher mortality than the critical group non-critical groups (61% vs 35% and 6%, P<0.05). Serum PCT level had a significantly negative correlation with PCIS (r=-0.63, P<0.001) but a significantly positive correlation with serum CRP level (r=0.73, P=0.003). Compared with the death group, the survival group had significantly higher serum levels of PCT and LA (P<0.05) but a significantly lower PCIS (P<0.05).There is a good correlation between serum PCT level and PCIS. For children with sepsis, the lower the PCIS, the higher the serum PCT level, resulting in a poorer prognosis. A combination of serum PCT and PCIS can be used as an early prognostic indicator in children with sepsis.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568916","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.660475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.638002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.577504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.49538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.379832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.371616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
