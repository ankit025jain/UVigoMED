{"id":82079,"title":"Cone beam computed tomographic analyses of the position and course of the mandibular canal: relevance to the sagittal split ramus osteotomy.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to document the position and course of the mandibular canal through the region of the mandibular angle and body in dental patients, using cone beam computed tomographic imaging.The position and course of the mandibular canal from the region of the third molar to the first molar were measured at five specific locations in the same plane: at three different positions just between the first and second molars; between the second and third molars; and just distal to the third molar.The study sample was composed of 500 hemimandibles from 250 dental patients with a mean age of 26.32. Significant differences were found between genders, distances, and positions. B decreased significantly from the anterior positions to the posterior positions in both females and males. The mean values of S and CB increased significantly from the posterior positions to the anterior positions in both females and males.Because the sagittal split ramus osteotomy is a technically difficult procedure, we hope that the findings of the present study will help the surgeon in choosing the safest surgical technique for the treatment of mandibular deformities.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719896","annotations":[{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.71735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.612257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.584828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Wisdom tooth","weight":0.30333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_tooth"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.239429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.229301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.160178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mandibular canal","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_canal"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Order of the Bath","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Tomographic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomographic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Ramus of the mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramus_of_the_mandible"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Spiral computed tomography","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
