{"id":62802,"title":"[Case of adenocarcinoma in situ accompanied by an intrapulmonary lymph node with a sarcoid-like reaction].","abstract":"A 65-year-old male underwent a chest CT scan, which revealed an 8 mm nodule on the wall of a bulla in the left lower lobe of the lung, and was thus suspected to be lung cancer. Pulmonary wedge resection of the left lower lobe by means of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was thus performed. A specimen of the lung revealed the presence of intrapulmonary lymph node on the wall of a bulla. The histopathological findings of the resected lung specimen showed non-caseating granulomas in the lymph node, and adenocarcinoma in situ. We concluded that the sarcoid-like reaction observed in the intrapulmonary lymph node was therefore related to the adenocarcinoma in situ.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511672","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.792215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.643318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.523279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.150894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.1201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Blister","weight":0.0497368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Secondary bronchus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_bronchus"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"}]}
