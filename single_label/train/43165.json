{"id":43165,"title":"Timely cholecystectomy for acute gallstone disease: an ongoing challenge in a New Zealand provincial centre.","abstract":"To review the prior management of patients who underwent cholecystectomy for gallstone disease at a provincial centre over a 1-year period, with a particular focus on potentially preventable morbidity by performing index cholecystectomy (IC).Retrospective case note review was performed for patients who underwent cholecystectomy at Hawke's Bay's hospitals between 1 March 2009 and 1 March 2010.148 cholecystectomies were performed over the study period. Ninety-one patients (61%) were admitted acutely prior to receiving cholecystectomy. The IC rate was 15%. Seventy-seven patients who were admitted acutely could have been suitable for IC, but were discharged. These 77 patients subsequently had an additional 17 readmissions (72 bed-days), 26 ED presentations and 51 outpatient clinic (OPC) visits prior to receiving their eventual operation. Ten patients (13%) developed a complication or recurrence of their acute gallstone disease whilst awaiting surgery.Hawke's Bay has a low rate of IC and fails to meet current international standards for timely surgical management of acute gallstone disease. A large proportion of those not operated on during their index admission re-present with further morbidity. There are significant barriers to improving these standards in a provincial centre with limited acute surgical resources.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24806247","annotations":[{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.193718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"International standard","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard"},{"name":"Hawke's Bay Region","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawke's_Bay_Region"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"March 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1"},{"name":"Marvel Comics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"ITM Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITM_Cup"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
