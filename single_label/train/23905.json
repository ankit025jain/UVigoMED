{"id":23905,"title":"Combination therapy of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 with antibiotics protects mice from Escherichia coli-induced sepsis*.","abstract":"Inflammation occurs along with infection during sepsis. 15-Epi-lipoxin A4 has protective and resolving effects in experimental models of infection. In this study, we examined the effects of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 combined with antibiotics on Escherichia coli-induced peritonitis.Prospective experimental study.University research laboratory.Male C57BL/6 mice.Mice were injected with E. coli to induce peritonitis and were given either 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (1 ?g/mouse) or placebo (saline) with antibiotics (ceftazidime). The effects of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 on peritoneal cell populations, bacterial burden, and cytokine production were assessed. Survival rates were observed for up to 7 days. In addition, we examined the effects of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 on peritoneal macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, CpG DNA, or live E. coli.Treatment with 15-epi-lipoxin A4 significantly reduced the number of neutrophils in the peritoneum, inhibited production of cytokines and chemokines, and decreased bacterial load in the serum. Combined treatment of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 with antibiotics significantly improved survival in E. coli-infected mice. 15-Epi-lipoxin A4 also attenuated the production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-? by lipopolysaccharide- or CpG DNA-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, 15-epi-lipoxin A4 combined with antibiotics synergistically reduced the production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-? by peritoneal macrophages stimulated with live E. coli.15-Epi-lipoxin A4 combined with antibiotics attenuated systemic inflammation, inhibited bacteria dissemination, and improved survival in E. coli-infected mice. The reduced production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-? by peritoneal macrophages suggested that 15-epi-lipoxin A4 blocked the initial proinflammatory response. Taken together, these data suggested that 15-epi-lipoxin A4 combined with antibiotics was beneficial in regulating the proinflammatory response in sepsis without exacerbating infection.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463858","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.90179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.734695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.71151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.682653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.660678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.573192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ceftazidime","weight":0.446139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.384237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.310686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.164972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
