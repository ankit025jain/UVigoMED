{"id":10438,"title":"The integrin adhesome: from genes and proteins to human disease.","abstract":"The adhesive interactions of cells with their environment through the integrin family of transmembrane receptors have key roles in regulating multiple aspects of cellular physiology, including cell proliferation, viability, differentiation and migration. Consequently, failure to establish functional cell adhesions, and thus the assembly of associated cytoplasmic scaffolding and signalling networks, can have severe pathological effects. The roles of specific constituents of integrin-mediated adhesions, which are collectively known as the 'integrin adhesome', in diverse pathological states are becoming clear. Indeed, the prominence of mutations in specific adhesome molecules in various human diseases is now appreciated, and experimental as well as in silico approaches provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological conditions.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651544","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Transmembrane protein","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.53395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.471137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.328977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Cell physiology","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_physiology"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"}]}
