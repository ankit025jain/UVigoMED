{"id":38354,"title":"[Comparative analysis of clinical indicators of gout patients of different syndrome types and its significance].","abstract":"To understand the difference in clinical indicators of gout patients of different Chinese medical syndromes and its clinical significance.Form November 2011 to December 2012, syndrome typed were 257 male gout in-/outpatients from Affiliated Hospital of Chuanbei Medical College. Another 50 healthy male subjects were recruited as the control. Their clinical and laboratory data were collected. All were excluded from infections and other inflammatory diseases.Four syndrome types existed in gout patients, i.e., intermingled phlegm-stasis blood syndrome (IPSBS), obstruction of dampness and heat syndrome (ODHS), Pi-deficiency induced dampness syndrome (PDIDS), qi-blood deficiency syndrome (QBDS). Of them, 53 acute phase gout patients suffered from IPSBS, 41 from ODHS, 25 from QBDS, and 17 from PDIDS; 41 non-acute phase gout patients suffered from QBDS, 40 from PDIDS, 24 from ODHS, and 16 from IPSBS. Statistical analysis of clinical data showed that, when compared with the normal control group, there was statistical difference in blood routines (WBC, GR, LY, MO) and blood biochemical indices (UA, Ur, Cr, ALT, AST, ALB, GLOB, TG, HDL-C, VLDL-C, apoA, apoB100) of gout patients of different syndromes (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). There was also statistical difference or correlation among different syndromes (P < 0.05).In the acute phase gout patients, IPSBS and ODHS were dominated, while in the non-acute phase gout patients, QBDS and PDIDS were often seen. In patients of IPSBS and ODHS, inflammation and immune response were more obvious, indicating that better efficacy might be achieved by clearing heat and removing blood stasis associated anti-inflammatory and immune regulation therapies. In patients of QBDS and PDIDS, impaired renal functions were more significant, indicating that better efficacy might be achieved by invigorating Pi and tonifying Shen dominated treatment.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
