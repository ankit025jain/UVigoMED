{"id":62286,"title":"[Honokiol combined with Gemcitabine synergistically inhibits the proliferation of human Burkitt lymphoma cells and induces their apoptosis].","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the effect of Honokiol (HNK) combined with Gemcitabine (GEM) on the proliferation and apoptosis of human Burkitt lymphoma Raji cells. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 method to study the role of Honokiol and Gemcitabine in Raji cells. The cell apoptosis and cell cycle status were analyzed by flow cytometry. The level of apoptosis-related protein BCL-2 was measured with Western blot. The results showed that compared with cells treated with mentioned above drugs alone, the proliferative potential of cells in combination group was significantly inhibited (P < 0.01) and the inhibition rate was related to the concentration and action time of HNK; and apoptosis rate markedly increased (P < 0.01), while most Raji cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase and decreased in S phase after treatment with combination of two drugs; the expression of BCL-2 protein decreased (P < 0.01). It is concluded that Honokiol combined Gemcitabine can synergistically inhibit the proliferation, induce cell apoptosis, and down-regulate the expression of BCL-2 in Raji cells. The possible mechanism of synergistic effect may be related with arrest of cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and downregulation of the expression of BCL-2.
