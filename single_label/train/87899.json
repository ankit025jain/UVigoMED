{"id":87899,"title":"Influence of different rehabilitation therapy models on patient outcomes: hand function therapy in individuals with incomplete SCI.","abstract":"The primary objective was to compare the benefits of single (COT1) versus double (COT2) dose of conventional occupational therapy (COT) in improving voluntary hand function in individuals with incomplete, sub-acute C3-C7 spinal cord injury (SCI). The secondary objective was to compare these two interventions versus functional electrical stimulation therapy plus COT (FES + COT).Retrospective analysis. Setting Inpatient spinal cord rehabilitation center, Toronto.Individuals with traumatic incomplete sub-acute SCI.We analyzed the functional independence measure (FIM) and the spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) self-care sub-scores. Results The mean change scores on the FIM self-care sub-score for the COT1, COT2, and FES + COT groups were 12.8, 10, and 20.1 points, respectively. Similarly, the mean change scores on the SCIM self-care sub-score for the COT1, COT2, and FES + COT groups were, 2.6, 3.16, and 10.2 points, respectively.Increased rehabilitation intensity alone may not always be beneficial. The type of intervention plays a significant role in determining functional changes. In this instance, receiving one (COT1) or two (COT2) doses of COT resulted in similar outcomes, however, FES + COT therapy yielded much better outcomes compared to COT1 and COT2 interventions.","date":"2014-11-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968955","annotations":[{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.825552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.746087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Physical medicine and rehabilitation","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.712922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Functional electrical stimulation","weight":0.691396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.403754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Toronto","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.211962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Smart Common Input Method","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Common_Input_Method"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Finnish markka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_markka"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Cambridge_Catalogue_of_Radio_Sources"},{"name":"Center (American football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(American_football)"},{"name":"Car of Tomorrow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_of_Tomorrow"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Feline sarcoma oncogene","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_sarcoma_oncogene"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Cervical spinal nerve 7","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_spinal_nerve_7"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
