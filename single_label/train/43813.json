{"id":43813,"title":"Meaning of free intraperitoneal fluid in small-bowel obstruction: preliminary results using high-frequency microsonography in a rat model.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to detect the onset, evolution, and meaning of extraluminal free fluid in a rat model of small-bowel obstruction using high-frequency microsonography.Small-bowel obstruction was surgically created in 8 rats divided into 2 groups of 4 rats each. All rats were examined by high-frequency microsonography to monitor the evolution of small-bowel obstruction and the abdominal sonographic findings. In group 2 rats, the obstruction was resolved 2 hours after surgery.In all rats, free peritoneal fluid was detected just near the obstructed loop after 1 hour and in the hepatorenal recess after 2 hours. These features progressively increased in the following hours in group 1 rats. In group 2, the amount of free fluid decreased shortly after removing the obstruction.Free fluid is an early finding in small-bowel obstruction, and the increase or decrease of its amount is correlated with the worsening or resolution of the obstruction.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764344","annotations":[{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.307934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.297409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.13506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hepatorenal recess of subhepatic space","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_recess_of_subhepatic_space"},{"name":"Peritoneal fluid","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_fluid"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"}]}
