{"id":52672,"title":"[A multiple regression formula for the prediction of thyroid microcarcinoma].","abstract":"To establish a quantitative analysis formula for the prediction of thyroid microcarcinoma and decide the cut-off values for the recommendation of ultrasound-guided biopsy.The ultrasound characteristics of 830 subcentimeter thyroid nodules were retrospectively analyzed based on pathological results in this study. A diagnostic formula was developed using multivariate binary Logistic regression with the cut-off values for the recommendation of biopsy. The diagnostic values of each feature and the formula were evaluated.The most suspicious ultrasound characteristics for subcentimeter thyroid nodules were solid echostructure (OR=41.97), microlobulated margin (OR=25.89), hypoechoic echogenicity(OR=10.36), no halo (OR=8.38), irregular margin (OR=4.26), taller than wide (OR=2.71), microcalcification (OR=1.92), and macrocalcification (OR=1.28). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the formula were 90.9%, 54.0%, and 72.5%, respectively.This multiple regression formula is an objective tool for the evaluation of thyroid microcarcinoma, which can provide the cutoff values for the ultrasound guided biopsy.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581134","annotations":[{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.581145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.452663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.262149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.216985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.192117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.177158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Microcalcification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcalcification"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"830","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/830"},{"name":"Formula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Logistic distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Halo (religious iconography)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(religious_iconography)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
