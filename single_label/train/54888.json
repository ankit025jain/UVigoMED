{"id":54888,"title":"Mirror-hat device as a drop delivery aid: a pilot study.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel mirror-hat drop delivery aid.Prospective, observational study.Sixty eyes from 30 subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension attending the glaucoma unit at the Toronto Western Hospital.The mirror-hat device consists of a magnifying mirror attached to a brimmed cap. The aid was provided to subjects who self-administered topical antiglaucoma medications. Drop instillation technique (time taken to instill a drop, number of drops dispensed, drop contact location, and contamination of bottle tip) was evaluated with and without the device. Subjects also completed a survey regarding drop administration and satisfaction with the device.Subjects were less likely to contaminate the bottle tip by touching their eye/eyelid when using the device than without the device (13% vs 37%, respectively, p = 0.02). Twenty-six subjects (86.7%) indicated they could see the drop using the device versus 12 (40%) who reported they saw the drop without the device (p = 0.0005). There were no statistically significant differences in any of the other outcomes. No predictive factors were associated with improved drop administration technique while using the device including uncorrected near-visual acuity, lens status, and glaucoma severity.Use of the mirror-hat aid is associated with significantly less bottle-tip contamination and better visualization of the drop than without the device; however, the device did not help to reduce time, number of drops, or accuracy when administering eye drops.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25103649","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.873318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.461266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.424062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Toronto","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.213812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.114958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Mirror","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Toronto Western Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Western_Hospital"},{"name":"Ocular hypertension","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_hypertension"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Bottle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Magnification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Instillation abortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instillation_abortion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Visualization (computer graphics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
