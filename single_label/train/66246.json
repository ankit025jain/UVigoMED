{"id":66246,"title":"Japanese structure survey of high-precision radiotherapy in 2012 based on institutional questionnaire about the patterns of care.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to clarify operational situations, treatment planning and processes, quality assurance and quality control with relevance to stereotactic radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and image-guided radiotherapy in Japan.We adopted 109 items as the quality indicators of high-precision radiotherapy to prepare a questionnaire. In April 2012, we started to publicly open the questionnaire on the website, requesting every institution with radiotherapy machines for response. The response ratio was 62.1% (490 out of 789 institutions responded).Two or more radiotherapy technologists per linear accelerator managed linear accelerator operation in ?90% of the responded institutions while medical physicists/radiotherapy quality managers were engaged in the operation in only 64.9% of the institutions. Radiotherapy certified nurses also worked in only 18.4% of the institutions. The ratios of the institutions equipped for stereotactic radiotherapy of lung tumor, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and image-guided radiotherapy were 43.3, 32.6 and 46.8%, respectively. In intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning, radiation oncologists were usually responsible for delineation while medical physicists/radiotherapy quality managers or radiotherapy technologists set up beam in 33.3% of the institutions. The median time required for quality assurance of intensity-modulated radiotherapy at any site of brain, head and neck and prostate was 4 h. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy quality assurance activity had to be started after clinical hours in >60% of the institutions.This study clarified one major issue in the current high-precision radiotherapy in Japan. A manpower shortage should be corrected for high-precision radiotherapy, especially in the area relevant to quality assurance/quality control.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729623","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.703461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.572247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.54627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.419125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.371974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.356528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Linear particle accelerator","weight":0.256763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0867165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0480512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
