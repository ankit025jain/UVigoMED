{"id":82439,"title":"Dental technology over 150 years: evolution and revolution.","abstract":"A patient entering a dental office is often greeted and then checked in through the practice management system's digital appointment book. The provider is notified by an electronic signal that is visual, audible, or both. The patient is led to the treatment area and sits in a dental chair which is adjusted to the individual's size and position for the treatment, and the light is positioned. Sometimes a radiograph is taken, local anesthetic is delivered, and a handpiece--air turbine or electric--is used for the procedure. How different is this process today from a dentist treating a patient in 1864?","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624590","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.604856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.569549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.395781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.328904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.254857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.240554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.103058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Revolution","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution"},{"name":"Book","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Chairman","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman"},{"name":"Turbine","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine"},{"name":"Local anesthetic","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Signal processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing"},{"name":"1864","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1864"},{"name":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Practice management software","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_management_software"}]}
