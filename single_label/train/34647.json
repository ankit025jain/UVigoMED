{"id":34647,"title":"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in men presenting with acute coronary syndrome, successfully managed by intravascular ultrasound-guided percutaneous coronary intervention.","abstract":"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome. It is most commonly seen in young women, without atherosclerosis, in the peripartum period. Management options include conservative medical treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention or a surgical approach depending on the presentation, extent of dissection and luminal stenosis. We describe three unusual cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection occurring in young/middle-aged men-the first in association with heavy mechanical work, the second in association with high levels of anxiety and emotional distress and the third in association with intense physical exercise. In each case we report the use of coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound in the diagnosis of the condition, and their successful management using percutaneous coronary intervention.
