{"id":92729,"title":"Descending control of itch transmission by the serotonergic system via 5-HT1A-facilitated GRP-GRPR signaling.","abstract":"Central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT) modulates somatosensory transduction, but how it achieves sensory modality-specific modulation remains unclear. Here we report that enhancing serotonergic tone via administration of 5-HT potentiates itch sensation, whereas mice lacking 5-HT or serotonergic neurons in the brainstem exhibit markedly reduced scratching behavior. Through pharmacological and behavioral screening, we identified 5-HT1A as a key receptor in facilitating gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-dependent scratching behavior. Coactivation of 5-HT1A and GRP receptors (GRPR) greatly potentiates subthreshold, GRP-induced Ca(2+) transients, and action potential firing of GRPR(+) neurons. Immunostaining, biochemical, and biophysical studies suggest that 5-HT1A and GRPR may function as receptor heteromeric complexes. Furthermore, 5-HT1A blockade significantly attenuates, whereas its activation contributes to, long-lasting itch transmission. Thus, our studies demonstrate that the descending 5-HT system facilitates GRP-GRPR signaling via 5-HT1A to augment itch-specific outputs, and a disruption of crosstalk between 5-HT1A and GRPR may be a useful antipruritic strategy.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453842","annotations":[{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.848912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Serotonergic","weight":0.743385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonergic"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.536827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.491651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.439672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.238896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Biophysics","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics"},{"name":"Heteromer","weight":0.10298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteromer"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0506369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antipruritic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipruritic"},{"name":"Crosstalk (electronics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(electronics)"},{"name":"5-HT1 receptor","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1_receptor"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Augment (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augment_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Scratching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratching"},{"name":"Modulation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_(music)"},{"name":"Subthreshold conduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subthreshold_conduction"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"}]}
