{"id":28587,"title":"[Activity of antioxidant enzymes of the rat kidneys under mercury dichloride effect].","abstract":"Salts of heavy metals are excreted by the kidneys and, as pro-oxidants, stimulate the processes of free radical oxidation. Mercury ions are accumulated in the kidneys. So the study of the features of antioxidant enzymes adaptive response of different kidney layers in response to mercury dichloride is important. Catalase and glytathionperoxidase activity within rat kidneys 72 hours after mercury dichloride intoxication in the ratio of 5 ml per 1 kg of the animal weight was studied. It was important to reveal the influence of the mercury salts on rat kidney antioxidative system. Decreasing glytathionperoxidase activity in cortical and cerebral substances and renal papillae were accompanied by increased contents of oxidative modified proteins and lipids and morphological changes in renal tissue under salt and water loading after mercury dichloride poisoning. The results obtained evidence for the inhibition of antioxidative protection of enzymes in rat kidneys under the mercury dichloride effect.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834726","annotations":[{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.865191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.839721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Heavy metal (chemistry)","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Salt (chemistry)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.784946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.701877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.620719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.576586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Osmoregulation","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmoregulation"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.459309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Mercury (planet)","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0940019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Taste bud","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_bud"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Renal papilla","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_papilla"}]}
