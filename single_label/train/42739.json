{"id":42739,"title":"Predictive factors for adverse dermatological events during pegylated/interferon alpha and ribavirin treatment for hepatitis C.","abstract":"Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with pegylated interferon-alpha/ribavirin is associated with well-characterized dermatological adverse events (AEs), which can lead to premature discontinuation of treatment.To investigate the incidence and spectrum of dermatological AEs during CHC treatment with interferon-alpha plus ribavirin and analyzed factors predisposing patients to such reactions.Between January 2008 and December 2012, 152 CHC patients who had received interferon/pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy were enrolled in this retrospective study. To determine which factors were associated with dermatological AE development, a Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was performed.Thirty dermatological AEs were recorded in 28 (18.4%) patients. These reactions included 14 (9.2%) patients with eczematous reactions, four (2.6%) patients with xerosis, three (2.0%) patients with new-onset or exacerbation of psoriasis, two (1.3%) patients with lichenoid eruption, two (1.3%) patients with diffuse folliculitis and one patient with lichen planus, alopecia areata, hypermelanosis, and necrosis of the skin and toenails. Application of the Cox proportional-hazards model revealed that age older than 60 years (HR=1.070; 95% CI: 1.043-1.096), pre-existing anaphylaxis/skin disease (HR=2.612; 95% CI: 1.593-3.324), cirrhosis (HR=1.863; 95% CI: 1.047-3.013), and treatment with pegylated interferon formulations (HR=1.930; 95% CI: 1.052-3.687) were associated with occurrence of dermatologic AEs. Twenty-seven (90%) skin conditions were classified as mild to moderate, while one case (3.3%) warranted premature discontinuation of treatment.Dermatological AEs resulting from interferon-alpha/ribavirin treatment of CHC contribute to a wide spectrum involve the skin, mucous membrane, hair, and nails. These dermatological AEs correlated with older age, previous skin condition, cirrhosis, and use of pegylated interferon formulations.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Digestive System
