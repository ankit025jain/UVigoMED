{"id":88505,"title":"Maximising functional recovery following hip fracture in frail seniors.","abstract":"This review discusses factors affecting recovery following hip fracture in frail older people as well as interventions associated with improved functional recovery. Prefracture function, cognitive status, co-morbidities, depression, nutrition and social support impact recovery and may interact to affect post-fracture outcome. There is mounting evidence that exercise is beneficial following hip fracture with higher-intensity/duration programmes showing more promising outcomes. Pharmacologic management for osteoporosis has benefits in preventing further fractures, and interest is growing in pharmacologic treatments for post-fracture loss of muscle mass and strength. A growing body of evidence suggests that sub-populations - those with cognitive impairment, residing in nursing homes or males - also benefit from rehabilitation after hip fracture. Optimal post-fracture care may entail the use of multiple interventions; however, more work is needed to determine optimal exercise components, duration and intensity as well as exploring the impact of multimodal interventions that combine exercise, pharmacology, nutrition and other interventions.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836335","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.730883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.725549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.626043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.263398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.053079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Fee tail","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee_tail"}]}
