{"id":9967,"title":"Anesthesia and analgesia for standing equine surgery.","abstract":"Morbidity and mortality rate in equine anesthesia is still unacceptably high. Thus it is critical contemplating whether the benefit of general anesthesia for a specific patient and procedure outweighs the risks. Sedative protocols that would allow performing diagnostic and surgical procedures with the patient remaining standing would therefore be ideal. Infusion of short-acting agents allows to rapidly achieve a titratable steady state of sedation. Supplementing sedatives and tranquilizers with systemic analgesic or regional anesthetic techniques (i.e. epidurals) facilitates standing surgical procedures. Multimodal analgesia would also provide superior analgesia with potentially fewer side effects than a single agent approach.
