{"id":79861,"title":"Magnetic resonance imaging in neurocysticercosis.","abstract":"Cysticercosis in one of the most common parasitic infections in the central nervous system. The complex and unpredictable nature of the host immune reaction against cysticercosis as well as the pleomorphism of your injuries make the disease neurocysticercosis interesting and fascinating to study. Imaging studies play an important role in the diagnosis of this disease. Advanced imaging techniques have improved detection and visualization of scolex cysts extraparenchymal spaces.
