{"id":81692,"title":"Part II. Minimizing alveolar bone loss during and after extractions. Protocol and techniques for alveolar bone preservation.","abstract":"Alveolar ridge resorption accelerates following extraction of teeth and the residual defect varies from socket to socket. This article proposes a new treatment oriented classification of extraction defects. It also reviews several graft materials and membranes that aid in the decision for selecting an appropriate socket preservation technique. The algorithm developed by the authors helps design a potentially successful treatment plan based on the classification of extraction defects, with choices ranging from no treatment to complex grafting procedures (i.e. allogenic block grafts). In addition, the principles of wound healing and the ideal time points for utilizing the various types of graft materials and implants are discussed. This socket preservation treatment algorithm will guide clinicians to employ surgical procedures using various biomaterials to promote a successful outcome.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881443","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.506676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.324641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Biomaterial","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomaterial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.155023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.1416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.119373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0562312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Alveolar ridge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Ridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Allogenic succession","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allogenic_succession"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Minimisation (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimisation_(psychology)"}]}
