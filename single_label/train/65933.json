{"id":65933,"title":"Serum levels of trace elements in patients with prostate cancer.","abstract":"Trace elements are major components of biological structures; however, excessive levels of these elements can be toxic.In the present study, serum levels of trace elements were measured in 30 patients with newly diagnosed as prostate cancer and 32 healthy volunteer by using furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry.It was found that there was an increase in serum levels of Co, Cu, Mg and Pb (p<0.05), whereas a decrease in serum levels of Fe, Mn, and Zn levels in patients with prostate cancer (p<0.05).These changes may be important in the pathogenesis of prostate cancers; however, further prospective studies are needed to identify relationships between prostate cancer and trace elements.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761874","annotations":[{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Manganese","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.773266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.728461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.64723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.395022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Trace element","weight":0.378869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_element"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.177158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.139929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0517203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Furnace","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furnace"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Atomic absorption spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Printed circuit board","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0153745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Structural biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology"}]}
