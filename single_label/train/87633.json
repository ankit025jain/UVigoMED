{"id":87633,"title":"[Use of NSAIDs in traumatology].","abstract":"In traumatology, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used, due to their efficacy in controlling pain and safety profile. Nonetheless, experimental and retrospective studies about the use of NSAIDs in traumatology raise the question about a possible negative influence on bone remodeling through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The results from these studies must be interpreted with caution, as bone repair can be influenced by several parameters. When used in the case of sprains or tendinitis, unwanted side effects of NSAIDs seem to be limited; on the other hand, benefits in terms of antalgic effect are less clear. We have conducted a review of the literature aimed to suggest practical solutions for the use of NSAIDs in traumatology.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055472","annotations":[{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.702814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.664316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Tendinitis","weight":0.435248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinitis"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.303556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.138706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Traumatology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatology"},{"name":"Sprain","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Antalgic gait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antalgic_gait"}]}
