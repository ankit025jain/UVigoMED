{"id":10131,"title":"Respiratory assessment in centronuclear myopathies.","abstract":"The centronuclear myopathies (CNMs) are a group of inherited neuromuscular disorders classified as congenital myopathies. While several causative genes have been identified, some patients do not harbor any of the currently known mutations. These diverse disorders have common histological features, which include a high proportion of centrally nucleated muscle fibers, and clinical attributes of muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency. Respiratory problems in CNMs may manifest initially during sleep, but daytime symptoms, ineffective airway clearance, and hypoventilation predominate as more severe respiratory muscle dysfunction evolves. Respiratory muscle capacity can be evaluated using a variety of clinical tests selected with consideration for the age and baseline motor function of the patient. Similar clinical tests of respiratory function can also be incorporated into preclinical CNM canine models to offer insight for clinical trials. Because respiratory problems account for significant morbidity in patients, routine assessments of respiratory muscle function are discussed.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668768","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoventilation","weight":0.865113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoventilation"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.718494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.694863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.664622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.600011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.268235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.234157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Congenital myopathy","weight":0.229973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_myopathy"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Harbor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"}]}
