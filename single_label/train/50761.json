{"id":50761,"title":"Extracellular activation of Wnt signaling through epigenetic dysregulation of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (Wif-1) is associated with pathogenesis of adrenocortical tumor.","abstract":"Wnt/?-catenin signaling is considered to be an essential regulator of adrenocortical oncogenesis. Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (Wif-1), an extracellular regulator of Wnt signaling, is frequently down-regulated by hypermethylation of the promoter CpG. We investigated epigenetic regulation of Wif-1 and its association with adrenocortical (AC) tumor pathogenesis in light of Wnt activation. The AC tumors showed a high prevalence of Wif-1 promoter methylation and low prevalence of Wif-1 mRNA transcription as compared to the normal adrenal (NA) samples. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between Wif-1 promoter methylation and mRNA transcription in the tumors. Either intracellular ?-catenin accumulation or ?-catenin mRNA transcription was significantly elevated in the AC tumors, which also showed an inverse correlation with Wif-1 mRNA transcription. Cyclin D1, a target gene of Wnt signaling, was also up-regulated in the AC tumors as compared with the NA samples. In addition, down-regulation of Wif-1 was correlated with increased cyclin D1 at both mRNA and protein levels. However, despite the proposed activation of Wnt signaling in AC tumors, only 2 of 20 with intracellular ?-catenin accumulation showed ?-catenin mutations. Thus, genetic alterations of ?-catenin and epigenetics-related Wif-1 promoter hypermethylation may be important mechanisms underlying AC tumor formation though aberrant canonical Wnt/?-catenin signaling activation.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755523","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.617711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.564734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.546707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"Cyclin D","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.460295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.457531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.4205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.292416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.108733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor D1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D1"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
