{"id":14404,"title":"IL-1? hampers glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in Cohen diabetic rat islets through mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase inhibition by nitric oxide.","abstract":"A high-sucrose, low-copper-diet (HSD) induces inhibition of glucose-sensitive rats (CDs) but not Cohen diabetes-resistant rats (CDr). Copper-supplemented HSD increased activity of the copper-dependent mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and reversed hyperglycemia. This study examined the mechanism by which interleukin-1? modulates GSIS and the role of COX in this process. We measured COX activity, ATP content, GSIS, iNOS expression, and nitrite production with and without IL-1?, N(?)-nitro-l-arginine, copper, or potassium cyanide in isolated islets of CDs and CDr fed different diets. We found reduced COX activity, ATP content, and GSIS in isolated islets of CDs rats fed a regular diet. These were severely reduced following HSD and were restored to regular diet levels on copper-supplemented HSD (P < 0.01 vs. CDr islets). Potassium cyanide chemically reduced COX activity, decreasing GSIS and thus reinforcing the link between islet COX activity and GSIS. Interleukin-1? (2.5 U/ml) reduced GSIS and COX activity in CDs islets. Exposure to 10 U/ml interleukin-1? decreased GSIS and COX activity in both CDs and CDr islets, inducing a similar nitrite production. Nevertheless, the effect on GSIS was more marked in CDs islets. A significant iNOS expression was detected in CDs on the HSD diet, which was reduced by copper supplementation. N(?)-nitro-l-arginine and copper prevented the deleterious effect of interleukin-1? on COX activity and GSIS. We conclude that reduced islet COX activity renders vulnerability to GSIS inhibition on low-copper HSD through two interrelated pathways: 1) by further reducing the activity of COX that is essential for ?-cell ATP-production and insulin secretion and 2) by inducing the expression of iNOS and nitric oxide-mediated COX inhibition. We suggest that islet COX activity must be maintained above a critical threshold to sustain adequate GSIS with exposure to low-copper HSD.
