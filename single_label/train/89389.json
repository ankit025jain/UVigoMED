{"id":89389,"title":"Factors associated with self-reported arthritis 7 to 24 years after a traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to profile characteristics of people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who self-reported arthritis 7 to 24 yr. post-injury. Pre- and post-injury socio-demographic factors, injury-related factors, and postinjury standardized assessments measuring health, activity, and participation outcomes were assessed in a retrospective cohort study of 274 participants. The group self-reporting arthritis had significantly more sleep disturbances, poorer overall health, lower mental health and physical function, and decreased productivity. Also, they were older and reported a shorter length of loss of consciousness from TBI. These resulted suggest that musculoskeletal complaints from long-term survivors of TBI sholud be addressed in post-acute care and could guide future research on arthritis in the TBI population.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724527","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.65248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Unconsciousness","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.212143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.100451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.0460588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
