{"id":75240,"title":"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: cerebral perfusion measured with pCASL before and repeatedly after CSF removal.","abstract":"Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) measurements were performed in 20 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) to investigate whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases during the first 24 hours after a cerebrospinal fluid tap test (CSF TT). Five pCASL magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. Two scans were performed before removal of 40?mL CSF, and the other three at 30 minutes, 4 hours, and 24 hours, respectively after the CSF TT. Thirteen different regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on coregistered MR images. In patients with increased CBF in lateral and frontal white matter after the CSF TT, gait function improved more than it did in patients with decreased CBF in these regions. However, in the whole sample, there was no significant increase in CBF after CSF removal compared with baseline investigations. The repeatability of CBF measurements at baseline was high, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.60 to 0.90 for different ROIs, but the median regional variability was in the range of 5% to 17%. Our results indicate that CBF in white matter close to the lateral ventricles plays a role in the reversibility of symptoms after CSF removal in patients with iNPH.
