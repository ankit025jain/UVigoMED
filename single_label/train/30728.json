{"id":30728,"title":"Reducing substance use during adolescence: a translational framework for prevention.","abstract":"Most substance use is initiated during adolescence when substantial development of relevant brain circuitry is still rapidly maturing. Developmental differences in reward processing, behavioral flexibility, and self-regulation lead to changes in resilience or vulnerability to drugs of abuse depending on exposure to risk factors. Intervention and prevention approaches to reducing addiction in teens may be able to capitalize on malleable brain systems in a predictable manner.This review will highlight what is known about how factors that increase vulnerability to addiction, including developmental stage, exposure to early life adversity (ranging from abuse, neglect, and bullying), drug exposure, and genetic predisposition, impact the development of relevant systems.Appropriate, early intervention may restore the normal course of an abnormal trajectory and reduce the likelihood of developing a substance use disorder (SUD) later in life. A considerable amount is known about the functional neuroanatomy and/or pharmacology of risky behaviors based on clinical and preclinical studies, but relatively little has been directly translated to reduce their impact on addiction in high-risk children or teenagers. An opportunity exists to effectively intervene before adolescence when substance use is likely to emerge.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464527","annotations":[{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Neuroanatomy","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.687218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bullying","weight":0.554797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.537795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.516351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.482859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Reward system","weight":0.413105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.276389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Neglect","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglect"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Information processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Psychological resilience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience"}]}
