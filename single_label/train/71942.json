{"id":71942,"title":"[New approaches to target leukemia stem cells].","abstract":"Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy initiated and maintained by \"leukemia stem cells(LSC)\" which possesses self-renewal capacity. LSCs are therapeutic targets and must be eliminated to cure the patients. Recent advances in LSC research provided insights into the cell surface antigens preferentially expressed on AML-LSCs compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells and the signaling pathways defining the LSC characteristics. These molecules are potential targets to eradicate LSCs. Especially, monoclonal antibodies targeting surface antigens expressed on LSCs, including CD123, CD44, TIM-3 and CD47 have been shown its efficacy against AML-LSCs in xenotransplant models.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016798","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"CD44","weight":0.90416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD44"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.619035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.611024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.607424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.53857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.405052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.38698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.379063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Interleukin-3 receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin-3_receptor"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Word stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
