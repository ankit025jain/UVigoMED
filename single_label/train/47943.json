{"id":47943,"title":"Evaluation of quality of life following placement of self-expanding plastic stents as a bridge to surgery in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer.","abstract":"To determine whether self-expanding plastic stent (SEPS) placement significantly improves quality of life and maintains optimal nutrition while allowing full-dose neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in patients with esophageal cancer.Fifty-two patients were enrolled; 3 (5.8%) had stent migrations requiring replacement. There were no instances of esophageal erosion or perforation. All patients received some form of neoadjuvant therapy. Thirty-six (69%) received chemoradiation; 34 (93%) of these patients received the planned dose of chemotherapy, and 27 (75%) received the full planned dose of radiotherapy. There were 16 (31%) patients receiving chemotherapy alone; 12 (74%) of patients in the chemotherapy-alone group completed the planned dose of therapy.Placement of SEPS appears to provide significant improvement in quality of life related to dysphagia and eating restriction in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Consideration of SEPS instead of percutaneous feeding tube should be initiated as a first line in dysphagia palliation and NAT nutritional support.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567281","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.693363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.664199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.453889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.439055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.285578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Network address translation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
