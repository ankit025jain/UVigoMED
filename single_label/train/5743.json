{"id":5743,"title":"Nonmedical factors associated with feather picking in pet psittacine birds.","abstract":"A nested case-control study was performed to determine nonmedical risk factors associated with feather picking in psittacine birds. Forty-two case birds, reported by their owners to pick their feathers, and 126 unaffected birds were compared. The odds of feather picking were higher in 2 species categories, African grey parrots (Psitticus erithacus, adjusted odds ratio [ORadj = 8.4, P < .001) and cockatoos (Cacatua species, ORadj = 12.7, P < .001). The odds of feather picking also were higher for birds that were out of their cages more than 8 hours per day (ORadj = 7.4, P < .001) and for birds that had been taken in by the owner as a \"rescue\" (ORadj = 4.7, P < .01). The odds of feather picking decreased by almost 90% (ORadj = 0.1, P < .005) for birds that interacted with people at least 4 hours a day. These findings identify characteristics that practitioners may want to include when asking bird owners about behavioral history and may be useful in focusing future research regarding this behavior.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115039","annotations":[{"name":"Pet","weight":0.750305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.746494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.689895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Feather","weight":0.478001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather"},{"name":"Parrot","weight":0.255986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot"},{"name":"Cockatoo","weight":0.232286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatoo"},{"name":"African Grey Parrot","weight":0.151888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Grey_Parrot"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Rescue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue"},{"name":"Grey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey"},{"name":"Cage (enclosure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(enclosure)"},{"name":"Eight-hour day","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day"}]}
