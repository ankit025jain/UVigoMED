{"id":24647,"title":"[Usefulness of virtual vessel images in ppi for treatment of complete obstruction of leg arteries].","abstract":"Following recent rapid advances in devices and treatment technology, indications for percutaneous peripheral intervention (PPI) have been expanded to include complex lesions (long-segment lesions, completely obstructed chronic lesions, etc.) and even lesions of the superficial femoral artery and arteries distal to the popliteal artery. However, when PPI is used for treatment of complete obstruction, treatment can take a long time or its outcome can be less satisfactory for reasons such as difficulty in assessing the vascular distribution/arrangement or the direction of calcification in the obstructed area or excessively long lesions. In the present study, we conducted three-dimensional image processing of CT data from leg arteries conventionally used for preoperative diagnosis. Using this processing technique, we created virtual images of the blood vessels of the completely obstructed area and mapped these virtual vessel images onto the fluoroscopic monitor image during catheter treatment. The usefulness of this technique for PPI was then evaluated. We succeeded in creating virtual vessel images of the completely obstructed parts of leg arteries with the use of preoperative CT images of leg arteries that we then mapped onto the fluoroscopic monitor images during treatment. We were successful in mapping virtual images onto the abdominal aorta in 96.8% of cases and in 95.7% with the common iliac artery. This technique is thus able to supply reliable information on vascular distribution/arrangement, suggesting that it can enable the surgeon to advance the treatment device precisely along the vessels, making it useful for treatment with PPI. The study additionally showed that differences in the angle of imaging affect the manual mapping of the CT images onto angiograms.
