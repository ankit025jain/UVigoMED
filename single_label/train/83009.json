{"id":83009,"title":"Biotherapies in Behçet's disease.","abstract":"Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic large-vessel vasculitis characterized by a wide clinical spectrum including recurrent oral and genital ulcerations, uveitis, vascular, neurological, articular, renal and gastrointestinal manifestations. Therapeutic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments with corticosteroids are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvements, more aggressive approach with immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations such as posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, vascular, and neurological and gastrointestinal involvements. However, some patients still have refractory disease, relapse, sight threatening eye disease, or irreversible organ damage. Recent improvements in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms have led to the identification of potential targets and future biological therapies for BD. In contrast to current non-specific immunosuppressive agents, the emergence of biotherapies provides the possibility of interfering with specific pathogenic pathways. Novel targeted biotherapies might be used in the future for BD.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473176","annotations":[{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.724967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colchicine","weight":0.68837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.655014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.610927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.609361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.605583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.526136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.368822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.33271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Bangladesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"}]}
