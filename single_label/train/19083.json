{"id":19083,"title":"[Pacemaker infection in a child; report of a case].","abstract":"In the treatment for pacemaker infection, removal of infected devices and intensive antibiotics therapy are in principle and new devices should be implanted apart from the infected site. However, there are some problems in the case of children:it is not easy to remove infected devices because epicardial leads are often used for them. If endocardial leads are chosen as a new system, extension of the lead would be concerned with their growth. We report a pediatric case of infection of pacemaker using epicardial leads. It was difficult to cure infection by repeated local treatment leaving epicardial leads and antibiotics therapy was obliged to continue for 9 years to keep infection under control. After growing up, we implanted endocardial leads for her and removed infected devices to cure infection completely.
