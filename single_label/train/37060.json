{"id":37060,"title":"A little CFTR goes a long way: CFTR-dependent sweat secretion from G551D and R117H-5T cystic fibrosis subjects taking ivacaftor.","abstract":"To determine if oral dosing with the CFTR-potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770, Kalydeco) improves CFTR-dependent sweating in CF subjects carrying G551D or R117H-5T mutations, we optically measured sweat secretion from 32-143 individually identified glands in each of 8 CF subjects; 6 F508del/G551D, one G551D/R117H-5T, and one I507del/R117H-5T. Two subjects were tested only (-) ivacaftor, 3 only (+) ivacaftor and 3 (+/-) ivacaftor (1-5 tests per condition). The total number of gland measurements was 852 (-) ivacaftor and 906 (+) ivacaftor. A healthy control was tested 4 times (51 glands). For each gland we measured both CFTR-independent (M-sweat) and CFTR-dependent (C-sweat); C-sweat was stimulated with a ?-adrenergic cocktail that elevated [cAMP]i while blocking muscarinic receptors. Absent ivacaftor, almost all CF glands produced M-sweat on all tests, but only 1/593 glands produced C-sweat (10 tests, 5 subjects). By contrast, 6/6 subjects (113/342 glands) produced C-sweat in the (+) ivacaftor condition, but with large inter-subject differences; 3-74% of glands responded with C/M sweat ratios 0.04%-2.57% of the average WT ratio of 0.265. Sweat volume losses cause proportionally larger underestimates of CFTR function at lower sweat rates. The losses were reduced by measuring C/M ratios in 12 glands from each subject that had the highest M-sweat rates. Remaining losses were estimated from single channel data and used to correct the C/M ratios, giving estimates of CFTR function (+) ivacaftor ?= 1.6%-7.7% of the WT average. These estimates are in accord with single channel data and transcript analysis, and suggest that significant clinical benefit can be produced by low levels of CFTR function.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520399","annotations":[{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.7269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Perspiration","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.582581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.307444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.299158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.291351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","weight":0.0500448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"R117 road","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R117_road"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"1593","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1593"},{"name":"852","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/852"},{"name":"265","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/265"},{"name":"906","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/906"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"VX (nerve agent)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX_(nerve_agent)"},{"name":"5T (gang)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5T_(gang)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Cocktail","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
