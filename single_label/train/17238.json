The central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate at our medical ICU had increased steadily, with an average rate between January and May 2011 of .47%. We used a cross-team approach to implement bundle care as a strategy to reduce the CLABSI rate.We designed a project to reduce the CLABSI rate below .3% in our ICU.This project was conducted between June 2011 and May 2012. Our strategy included providing a sterile towel, implementing maximal barrier precautions (head to toe), designing an illustration explaining how to use 2% CHG, establishing a procedures and care checklist, implementing quality assurance for procedures and care, and providing education on bundle care.The CLABSI rate reduced to .24% after project implementation. This result was below the target of .30%.We want to share this experience to help other hospitals and units improve critical care quality and to continue working to achieve a zero-tolerance infection rate.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899562","annotations":[{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.818369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.730035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.530336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.37038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.170908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Checklist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"},{"name":"Gluconic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconic_acid"},{"name":"Care2","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care2"},{"name":"Towel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel"},{"name":"Illustration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustration"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
