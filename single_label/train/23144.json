{"id":23144,"title":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage in infants with protein-energy malnutrition.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) colonization in infants with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and to characterize the antibiotic susceptibility patterns in isolated strains.The study included 123 infants with PEM, admitted to the Paediatric Rehabilitation Department of,,St. Mary\" Emergency Clinical Children's Hospital Ia?i, during October 1st 2010 and August 30th 2011. Nasal, pharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for detection of colonization upon admission and at discharge.The study revealed a high rate of MRSA carriage among infants with PEM (62.60%), most of the isolated strains being multidrug-resistant (86.13%), with additional resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides and inducible resistance to clindamycin. 88% of colonized infants were nasal carriers.Identification of MRSA carriers permits the implementation of measures that decrease the risk for subsequent infection.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502042","annotations":[{"name":"Clindamycin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clindamycin"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Aminoglycoside","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.811578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.751478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Macrolide","weight":0.735611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.732614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.34328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.266338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.251907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Childrens Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childrens_Hospital"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"August 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_30"},{"name":"October 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1"},{"name":"Mary (mother of Jesus)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Iaido","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iaido"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
