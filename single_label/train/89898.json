{"id":89898,"title":"[Expression and significance of TGF-beta1 and BMP-2 in mandibular callus].","abstract":"To investigate the expressions of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in human mandible fracture callus and their quantity changes in the process of healing.Thirty callus samples from the fractured mandible bone stumps were collected during operation, and two callus samples were collected from the angle-square jaw patients as controls. The expressions of TGF-beta1 and BMP-2 were test by the immunohistochemistry technic-SABC-staining in different periods of human fractured mandibular callus and in osseous tissue of normal angle of mandible.The TGF-beta1 and BMP-2 were expressed in callus of different periods but not in normal bone tissue. The expression of TGF-beta1 increased slowly during the first three weeks after fracture and reached its maximum in the third week, and then weakened gradually. The expression of BMP-2 increased gradually during the first two weeks after fracture and reached its maximum in the second week, then the expression weakened gradually.(1) BMP-2 may be one of the factors promoting the repair of fracture. (2) TGF-beta1 could be another signal pathway in repairment of fracture. (3) There could exist some synergistic effects between TGF-beta1 and BMP-2 in the process of fracture healing.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669688","annotations":[{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.911937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.909087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.665606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.566678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.535623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.531615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.412202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.401224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.399516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor beta","weight":0.370578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor_beta"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein 2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein_2"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"CD29","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD29"},{"name":"Stump (cricket)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)"}]}
