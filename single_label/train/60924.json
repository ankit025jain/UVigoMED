{"id":60924,"title":"Comparative metabolomics analysis on hematopoietic functions of herb pair Gui-Xiong by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and pattern recognition approach.","abstract":"The compatibility of Angelicae Sinensis Radix (Danggui, DG) and Chuanxiong Rhizoma (Chuanxiong, CX), a famous herb pair Gui-Xiong (GX), can produce synergistic and complementary hematopoiesis. In present study, global metabolic profiling with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) combined with pattern recognition method was performed to discover the underlying hematopoietic regulation mechanisms of DG, CX and GX on hemolytic and aplastic anemia rats (HAA) induced by acetyl phenylhydrazine (APH) and cyclophosphamide (CP). Thirteen endogenous metabolites contributing to the separation of model group and control group were tentatively identified. The levels of LPCs including lysoPC (18:0), lysoPC (20:4), lysoPC (16:0) and lysoPC (18:2), sphinganine, nicotinic acid, thiamine pyrophosphate, phytosphingosine, and glycerophosphocholine increased significantly (p<0.05) in HAA, while the levels of oleic acid, 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, ceramides (d18:1/14:0), and 17a-hydroxypregnenolone decreased significantly (p<0.05) in comparison with control rats. Those endogenous metabolites were chiefly involved in thiamine metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism. The metabolic deviations could be regulated closer to normal level after DG, CX and GX intervention. In term of hematopoietic function, GX was the most effective as shown by the relative distance in PLS-DA score plots and relative intensity of metabolomic strategy, reflecting the synergic action between DG and CX. The relative distance calculation was firstly used in metabolomics for semi-quantization.
