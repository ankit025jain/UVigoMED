{"id":53088,"title":"Inner retinal oxygen delivery and metabolism in streptozotocin diabetic rats.","abstract":"The purpose of the study is to report global measurements of inner retinal oxygen delivery (DO2_IR) and oxygen metabolism (MO2_IR) in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats.Phosphorescence lifetime and blood flow imaging were performed in rats 4 (STZ/4 wk; n = 10) and 6 (STZ/6 wk; n = 10) weeks following injection of STZ to measure retinal arterial (O2A) and venous (O2V) oxygen contents and total retinal blood flow (F). DO2_IR and MO2_IR were calculated from measurements of F and O2A and of F and the arteriovenous oxygen content difference, respectively. Data in STZ rats were compared to those in healthy control rats (n = 10).Measurements of O2A and O2V were not significantly different among STZ/4 wk, STZ/6 wk, and control rats (P ? 0.28). Likewise, F was similar among all groups of rats (P = 0.81). DO2_IR measurements were 941 ± 231, 956 ± 232, and 973 ± 243 nL O2/min in control, STZ/4 wk, and STZ/6 wk rats, respectively (P = 0.95). MO2_IR measurements were 516 ± 175, 444 ± 103, and 496 ± 84 nL O2/min in control, STZ/4 wk, and STZ/6 wk rats, respectively (P = 0.37).Global inner retinal oxygen delivery and metabolism were not significantly impaired in STZ rats in early diabetes.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550355","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.779268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.513105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.460205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Phosphorescence","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0863578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Missouri","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"973","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/973"},{"name":"941","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/941"},{"name":"Volgograd Tractor Factory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd_Tractor_Factory"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
