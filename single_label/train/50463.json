{"id":50463,"title":"Early hyperglycemia detected by continuous glucose monitoring in children at risk for type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"We explore continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as a new approach to defining early hyperglycemia and diagnosing type 1 diabetes in children with positive islet autoantibodies (Ab+).Fourteen Ab+ children, free of signs or symptoms of diabetes, and nine antibody-negative (Ab-) subjects, followed by the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young, were asked to wear a Dexcom SEVEN CGM.The Ab+ subjects showed more hyperglycemia, with 18% time spent above 140 mg/dL, compared with 9% in Ab- subjects (P = 0.04). Their average maximum daytime glucose value was higher, and they had increased glycemic variability. The mean HbA1c in the Ab+ subjects was 5.5% (37 mmol/mol). Among Ab+ subjects, ?18-20% CGM time spent above 140 mg/dL seems to predict progression to diabetes.CGM can detect early hyperglycemia in Ab+ children who are at high risk for progression to diabetes. Proposed CGM predictors of progression to diabetes require further validation.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784826","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.610814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"1820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1820"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"}]}
