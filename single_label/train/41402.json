{"id":41402,"title":"Right atrial pressure may impact early survival of patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation.","abstract":"To elucidate the impact of right atrial (RA) pressure on early mortality after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).In this single institution retrospective study, 125 patients (M:F = 75:50, mean age 55 years) who underwent TIPS with recorded intra-procedural RA pressures between 1999-2012 were studied. Demographic (age, gender), liver disease (Child-Pugh, Model for End Stage Liver Disease or MELD score), and procedure (indication, urgency, Stent type, portosystemic gradient or PSG reduction, baseline and post-TIPS RA pressure) data were identified, and the influence of these parameters on 30- and 90-day mortality was assessed using binary logistic regression.TIPS were created for variceal hemorrhage (n = 55) and ascites (n = 70). Hemodynamic success rate was 99% (124/125) and mean PSG reduction was 13 mmHg. 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 18% (19/106) and 28% (29/106). Baseline and final RA pressure were significantly associated with 30- (12 vs. 15 mmHg, P = 0.021; 18 vs. 21 mmHg, P = 0.035) and 90-day (12 vs. 14 mmHg, P = 0.022; 18 vs. 20 mmHg, P = 0.024) survival on univariate analysis. Predictive usefulness of RA pressure was not confirmed in multivariate analyses. Area under receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis revealed good pre- and post-TIPS RA pressure predictive capacity for 30- (0.779, 0.810) and 90-day (0.813, 0.788) mortality among variceal hemorrhage patients at 14.5 and 21.5 mm Hg thresholds.Intra-procedural RA pressure may have predictive value for early post-TIPS mortality. Pre-procedure consideration and optimization of patient cardiac status may enhance candidate selection, risk stratification, and clinical outcomes, particularly in variceal hemorrhage patients.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927612","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.699309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.520857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.493687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt","weight":0.422222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjugular_intrahepatic_portosystemic_shunt"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.393623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Central venous pressure","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_pressure"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.258783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.236714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.135845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
