{"id":88730,"title":"Surgical management of combat-related upper extremity injuries.","abstract":"This review presents the current surgical management of combat-related upper extremity injuries during the acute phase. The strategy consists of saving the life, saving the limb and retaining function. Surgical tactics are based on damage control orthopaedics techniques of haemorrhage control, wound debridement, and temporary bone stabilization prior to evacuation out of the combat zone. Features of the definitive management of local casualties in battlefield medical facilities are also discussed. In this situation, reconstructive procedures have to take into account the limited resources and operational constraints.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798097","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.722028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.704798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.437493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.360881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.0752563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.0512665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Emergency evacuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_evacuation"},{"name":"ABC (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"},{"name":"Damage control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_control"}]}
