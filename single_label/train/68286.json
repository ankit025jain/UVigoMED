{"id":68286,"title":"Chemoprevention of prostate cancer by isoflavonoids.","abstract":"In Europe, prostate cancer (PC) is the most common malignancy in males. There are three known risk factors strongly coherent to the development of PC: heredity, ethnical origin, and age. Migration studies have shown that environmental factors may influence the development of PC. In this context, specific nutritional components may exert an influence on the tumorigenesis of PC. Primary prevention of PC is still an important issue due to its high prevalence, treatment-associated morbidities, and long-term complications. Phytoestrogenes as flavonoids seem to play an essential role in the chemoprevention of PC which is possibly due to their hormonal function and antioxidative capability. Flavonoids and their subgroups are naturally existent in traditional asian and vegetarian nutrients as coverings of plants, fruits, and vegetables. Two of the most frequently investigated flavonoids are genistein and quercetin. These nutritional components may have therapeutic potential and may impact the development of PC. Even though these flavonoids show promising results in the chemoprevention of PC, the literature is almost experimental, epidemiological, and retrospective with a missing long-term follow-up. Therefore, randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to evaluate in depth its oncologic effects in PC.
