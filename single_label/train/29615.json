{"id":29615,"title":"Cutaneous drug reactions in the pediatric population.","abstract":"Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) constitute a major pediatric health problem frequently encountered in clinical practice, and represent a diagnostic challenge. Children are more susceptible than adults to errors in drug dosage because of their smaller body size; moreover, ADRs can mimic other skin diseases of children, especially viral exanthems. Most ADRs with cutaneous involvement are mild and resolve on withdrawal of the causative drug. The most common forms of cutaneous ADRs, maculopapular exanthems and urticarial reactions, have excellent outcomes. Less frequent but more severe reactions may incur a risk of mortality.
