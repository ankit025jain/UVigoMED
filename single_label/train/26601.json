{"id":26601,"title":"Lesson of the month 1: broken heart in the intensive care unit.","abstract":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is an unusual form of acute cardiomyopathy showing left ventricular apical ballooning. TCM can masquerade as ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). TCM usually occurs following a variety of emotional stressors, but physical stressors can also trigger the condition, as highlighted by the present case. TCM can occur after an acute medical illness; therefore, physicians should be aware of this condition as a potential cause of inotrope-resistant hypotension. In patients with hypotension and moderate-to-severe left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, inotropic agents should be avoided, because they can worsen the degree of obstruction. Instead, beta-blockers are preferred, because they are capable of resolving the obstruction and consequently improve the haemodynamics.
