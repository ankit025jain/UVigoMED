{"id":28846,"title":"New drug use among agricultural workers.","abstract":"Research on drug use onset rarely examines the spatial dimensions of onset, owing to a literature that is overwhelming from urban areas of an industrialized country (United States). Narrative interviews from drug-using agricultural workers in contrast reveal another side of drug use onset, where influence of familiarity with place becomes evident, despite the expectation that the novelty and/or adventure within a lifestyle of seasonal employment and migratory labor that requires overnight accommodations on-the-season is likely to push/pull one into the first use of a new drug or the first drug that an individual has ever used.
