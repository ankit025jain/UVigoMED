{"id":64836,"title":"Development of a simplified method of human semen storage for the testing of sperm DNA fragmentation using the Halosperm G2 test kit.","abstract":"To develop a simple, convenient, and stable storage method for semen before DNA fragmentation testing.Experimental cross-sectional study.Fertility clinic.164 male partners of infertile couples.Comparison of sperm DNA fragmentation levels (DFLs) using fresh, snap-frozen and air-dried semen, with air-dried samples stored at different temperatures and time periods to assess DNA stability.DFL determined by Halosperm G2 kit.Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean. The DFLs from fresh and air-dried semen gave comparable results (1.08% ± 0.65%), and from snap-frozen and fresh samples a statistically significant difference (5.5% ± 1.09%). Air-dried semen stored at room temperature for 7 days had a statistically significantly higher DFL compared with semen stored overnight (46.29% ± 9.12%). Samples stored at 4°C for 7 days or 1 day showed no statistically significant difference (0.83% ± 0.82%). DFLs from samples stored for either 1 or 30 days at 4°C showed a statistically significant difference (19.59% ± 5.72%); those stored at -22°C showed no statistically significant difference (0.68% ± 0.53%).Air-drying semen is a simple and stable storage method for up to 1 month at -22°C before DNA fragmentation testing.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25212839","annotations":[{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.782496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.711178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.589614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.478001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.446942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.38942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.372605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.318165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Fertility clinic","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_clinic"},{"name":"Room temperature","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standard error (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_(statistics)"},{"name":"DNA fragmentation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_fragmentation"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Stable storage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_storage"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"The Guardian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"},{"name":"Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Democratic-Farmer-Labor_Party"}]}
