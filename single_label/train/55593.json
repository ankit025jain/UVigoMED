{"id":55593,"title":"Targeted agents: management of dermatologic toxicities.","abstract":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of many cancers, and the cutaneous toxicity profile associated with these agents has become prominent. In fact, dermatologic side effects have also been reported with other targeted agents, including both BRAF and mTOR inhibitors. During her presentation at the NCCN 19th Annual Conference, Dr. Barbara Burtness reviewed the array of skin complications caused by many targeted therapies, focusing on the more common culprits, the role of prophylactic versus reactive management strategies, the need to be attentive to potential infections, the importance of mastering local measures to improve quality of life and cosmetic issues, the therapeutic mainstays (oral and topical antibiotics and topical steroids), and the preference of improving these cutaneous complications over suspending anticancer treatment.
