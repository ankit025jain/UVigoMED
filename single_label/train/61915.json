{"id":61915,"title":"Two cases of methaemoglobinaemia secondary to amyl nitrate use.","abstract":"We wish to report two cases of methaemoglobinaemia secondary to amyl nitrate use. A 55-year-old male presented with saturations in the mid 80s despite FiO2 of 1.0 and GCS 10 and a 22-year-old female who presented with fluctuating GCS and a slate grey colour. Both were found to have high levels of metheamoglobinaemia on ABG, were treated with methylene blue and made excellent recoveries. These cases illustrate the risk of methaemoglobinaemia secondary to amyl nitrate. Appropriate and prompt management can lead to very good outcomes.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654484","annotations":[{"name":"Slate","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Nitrate","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Methylene blue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"},{"name":"Methemoglobinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobinemia"},{"name":"Amyl nitrate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyl_nitrate"},{"name":"Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_knocked-out_(avulsed)_teeth"},{"name":"Methylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Geographic coordinate system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Alticor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alticor"},{"name":"Grey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey"},{"name":"FiO2","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiO2"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Amyl","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyl"},{"name":"Slate gray","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_gray"}]}
