{"id":28829,"title":"Effect of atorvastatin on vascular endothelial function in moderately nicotine-dependent smokers.","abstract":"We investigated the effect of atorvastatin on vascular endothelial function in moderately nicotine-dependent smokers. One hundred and sixty moderately nicotine-dependent smokers were randomly divided into the atorvastatin group (N = 80) and the control group (N = 80). Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting plasma glucose levels, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine phosphokinase, and brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation function (FMD) were measured before and 12 months after atorvastatin treatment. After a 12-month atorvastatin therapy, the TC and LDL-C levels of patients were decreased significantly (P < 0.05) and the FMD of patients were improved significantly (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, TC and LDL-C of the patients were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and the FMD of the patients were significantly improved (P < 0.05). Atorvastatin may significantly improve endothelial function in moderately nicotine-dependent smokers.
