{"id":55583,"title":"Extended association study of PLEKHA7 and COL11A1 with primary angle closure glaucoma in a Han Chinese population.","abstract":"To investigate the association of PLEKHA7 and COL11A1 with primary angle closure glaucoma, as well as acute and chronic subphenotype, in a Han Chinese population.A total of 984 cases, including 606 primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) and 378 primary angle closure (PAC), and 922 normal controls were recruited. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1676486, rs3753841, rs12138977, rs2126642, rs2622848, rs216489, rs1027617, rs366590, rs11024060, rs6486330, rs11024097, and rs11024102) in the PLEKHA7 gene and COL11A12 gene were genotyped. Distributions of allele frequencies were compared between cases and controls as well as in patient subgroups with or without acute attacks.Four of the 12 SNPs, including rs1676486 (P = 0.0060) and rs12138977 (P = 0.028) in COL11A1, as well as rs216489 (P = 0.0074) and rs11024102 (P = 0.038) in PLEKHA7, were found to have a statistically significant association with PAC/PACG. In the subgroup analysis, 6 out of 12 SNPs (rs1676486, rs3753841, rs12138977, rs216489, rs11024060, and rs11024102) showed statistically significant differences between acute PAC/PACG cases and controls. However, none of them showed statistically significant differences between chronic PAC/PACG cases and controls.Our study suggests that rs1676486 and rs12138977 in COL11A1 as well as rs216489 and rs11024102 in PLEKHA7 are associated with an increased risk of PAC/PACG in the Han Chinese population, supporting prior reports of the association of COL11A1 and PLEKH7 with angle closure glaucoma. Both COL11A1 and PLEKHA7 were shown to confer significant risk for acute PAC/PACG. Further work is necessary to confirm the importance of COL11A1 and PLEKHA7 in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854855","annotations":[{"name":"Allele","weight":0.940352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.839573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.52411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.441745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.419023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.391667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.25754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"China","weight":0.22653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"A12 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A12_road_(England)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Collagen, type XI, alpha 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen,_type_XI,_alpha_1"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"378","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/378"},{"name":"984","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/984"},{"name":"922","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/922"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"New Hampshire Route 11A","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Route_11A"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
