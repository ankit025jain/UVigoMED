{"id":36149,"title":"Pregnancy in a woman with premature ovarian insufficiency associated with blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome type I. A case report.","abstract":"Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) type I is a rare disorder that causes a recognizable pattern of eye abnormalities and is associated with premature ovarian insufficiency. There is no data to guide the treatment of these patients when presenting with infertility.A 30-year-old, nulligravid woman with premature ovarian insufficiency associated with BPES type I presented to care secondary to a desire to conceive. Ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins was performed, and the patient conceived and delivered viable twins.It is not known whether premature ovarian insufficiency associated with BPES type I follows the same clinical course as idiopathic premature ovarian insufficiency. In patients with BPES type I who present with infertility, ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins may be a reasonable therapeutic option.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597293","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.701117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Epicanthic fold","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthic_fold"},{"name":"Ptosis (eyelid)","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis_(eyelid)"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ovulation induction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction"},{"name":"Blepharophimosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blepharophimosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 30","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_30"}]}
