{"id":78953,"title":"A whiff of trouble: tumours of the nasal cavity and their mimics.","abstract":"A range of disease entities can affect the nasal cavity, often presenting with variable and non-specific symptoms. There is considerable overlap between the clinical and radiological features of neoplastic and non-neoplastic entities. The nasal cavity is often included in routine imaging of the brain, middle ear, skull base, and paranasal sinuses and should be included as a critical review area. The definitive diagnosis is in most cases confirmed by histopathological analysis. However, this review highlights the role of imaging in identifying nasal cavity disease, eliciting features of aggressive or indolent behaviour, and helping to narrow the differential diagnosis, thus facilitating a systematic approach when reviewing the nasal cavity.
