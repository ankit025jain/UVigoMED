{"id":91472,"title":"[Differentiated approach for the osteosynthesis application in polytrauma with the lower extremities bones fractures].","abstract":"The results of treatment of 182 patients, suffering the long bones fractures of the lower extremities due to polytrauma, treated in traumatological departments of the Volynia and the Rivne regional clinical hospitals in 2006 - 2012 yrs, were analyzed. Significant efficacy of application of the blocking intramedullary osteosynthesis was revealed while treating the injured persons with femoral and tibial bones fractures in polytrauma in comparison with the compressive dynamical plates application.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501974","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.426206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.419817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.365966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.297039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.269364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.109809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Volhynia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volhynia"},{"name":"Rivne","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivne"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Compressive strength","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressive_strength"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"2006 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
