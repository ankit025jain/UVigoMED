{"id":91261,"title":"A case report of pancreatic transection by blunt abdominal trauma.","abstract":"Posttraumatic pancreatic rupture is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Various management strategies are described, but due to the relative rarity of this pathology no standards exist. We reported a 21 years old male with post traumatic complete rupture of the pancreatic isthmus,devascularization lesion of descending duodenum, right renal artery posttraumatic thrombosis and left lobe of the liver laceration. Laparotomy for hemostasis was initially performed in a different hospital and the patient was then referred to us.Pancreaticoduodenectomy and right nephrectomy were performed. Postoperatively the patient had a pancreaticojejunal anastomosis fistula spontaneously resolved at 45 days.Pancreaticoduodenectomy can in selected cases be a solution in pancreatic trauma.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524482","annotations":[{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.814871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.775768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.735145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.44932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.444756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Laceration","weight":0.434376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laceration"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Left lobe of liver","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_lobe_of_liver"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
