{"id":87307,"title":"[The specific mechanism of bruising inflicted by rubber bullets of traumatic weapons].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to elucidate the specific features of the injuries inflicted by rubber bullets of traumatic weapons based on the results of real and experimental observations. Morphological characteristics of external lesions are presented as determined by peculiarities of tissue destruction caused by mechanical impact. Metric characteristics of morphological features of contour (circular) bruises and elastic projectiles coincide with the dimensional ratio in the model of interaction of interest, i.e. the action of a dull indenter on the elastoplastic semispace.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275178","annotations":[{"name":"Natural rubber","weight":0.279429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.140173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Projectile","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Metric system","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Bullet","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Rubber bullet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Contour line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Experimental physics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_physics"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Mechanism (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering)"},{"name":"Action (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nanoindenter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoindenter"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"}]}
