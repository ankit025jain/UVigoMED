{"id":56155,"title":"Histologic findings of recipient corneas obtained via deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty.","abstract":"We sought to investigate the histologic findings of recipient corneasÂ obtained via deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK).The histology of three recipient corneas obtained from patients during DALK was investigated. In all cases, the Descemet membrane was successfully exposed without any perforation during surgery. The isolated corneal tissue was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff. In two cases, the tissues were examined using a transmission electron microscope.In one cornea obtained via DALK, only the corneal stroma was observed, and the Descemet membrane was not confirmed. In another case, the recipient cornea was detached within the Descemet membrane. In the third cornea, the banded layer membrane was partially confirmed.These findings suggest that the recipient corneas separated at different layers during the DALK procedure. With our surgical technique, the detachment of the Descemet membrane may occur at a mechanically weak segment. This separation site may not be between the Descemet membrane and the corneal stroma.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736973","annotations":[{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.856791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.798359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Descemet's membrane","weight":0.788684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descemet's_membrane"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stroma (animal tissue)","weight":0.650656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_(animal_tissue)"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.340194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.26553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.243717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.194318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Bird ringing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_ringing"},{"name":"Single-family detached home","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home"},{"name":"Lamella (materials)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamella_(materials)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
