{"id":52660,"title":"Glaucoma--diabetes of the brain: a radical hypothesis about its nature and pathogenesis.","abstract":"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness characterized by irremediable loss of retinal ganglion cells. Its risk increases with progressing age and elevated intraocular pressure. Studies have established that glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the damage involves many brain tissues from retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus. Despite lot of research, complete pathomechanism of glaucoma is not known and there is no treatment available except modification of intraocular pressure pharmacologically and/or surgically. We here present a hypothesis inspired by studies across many areas of molecular and clinical sciences in an integrative manner that leads to a uniquely unconventional understanding of this disorder. Our hypothesis postulates that glaucoma may possibly be the diabetes of the brain. Based on the remarkable similarities between glaucoma and diabetes we propose glaucoma also to be a type of diabetes. Glaucoma and diabetes share many aspects from various molecular mechanisms to involvement of insulin and possible use of antidiabetics in glaucoma therapy. Additionally, Alzheimer's disease has already been proposed to be diabetes type-3. We show that Alzheimer's disease is cerebral glaucoma and diabetes at the same time which, by transitive property of similarities, again leads to our hypothesis that glaucoma is diabetes of the brain. Our proposition may lead to appreciation of certain important facets of glaucoma which have previously not been given due consideration. It also may lead to an alternative classification of diabetes as pancreatic and brain diabetes thereby widening the vision arena of the understanding of both these disorders.
