{"id":67546,"title":"Soluble ?-klotho and its relation to kidney function and fibroblast growth factor-23.","abstract":"Relations between fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), soluble ?-klotho (s-?-klotho), and kidney function in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are still unclear. Especially the role of s-?-klotho requires further study.Our objectives were to analyze the relation of s-?-klotho to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), FGF-23, and other parameters of calcium-phosphate metabolism and to investigate the response of s-?-klotho to cholecalciferol.Twenty-four CKD (stage 1-5) patients participated in this 8-week randomized controlled trial (vitamin D and chronic renal insufficiency).Interventions included 40 000 IU cholecalciferol or placebo weekly.S-?-klotho was determined by ELISA with antihuman klotho antibodies 67G3 and 91F1.For all patients, s-?-klotho concentrations did not differ between CKD stages. When patients were subdivided based on FGF-23 concentrations, a positive association of s-?-klotho with eGFR became apparent in patients with lower than median FGF-23 concentrations but not in those above median value. Patients with s-?-klotho below 204 pg/mL showed higher age, lower phosphate clearance, and lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase compared with patients with higher s-?-klotho. Treatment with cholecalciferol significantly increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The increase of FGF-23 had only borderline significance. There was no significant effect of high-dose cholecalciferol administration for 8 weeks on plasma s-?-klotho.CKD patients with s-?-klotho below 204 pg/mL had higher age, lower phosphate clearance, and lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. An association of s-?-klotho with eGFR was observed only in the presence of close to normal, but not high, FGF-23 concentrations. Cholecalciferol treatment did not change s-?-klotho concentrations.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606097","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.841687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.785117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.741293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.730506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.620697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.517389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.38175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor 23","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_23"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
