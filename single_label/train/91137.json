{"id":91137,"title":"Tracheobronchial injury in the setting of an esophagectomy for cancer: postoperative discovery a bad omen.","abstract":"A tracheobronchial injury is an uncommon complication of an esophagectomy. Differences in outcomes may exist for patients with injuries detected intraoperatively and postoperatively.A retrospective review was performed for patients who underwent an esophagectomy for cancer at Jackson Memorial Hospital/University of Miami from January 2000 to June 2012.An injury to the tracheobronchial tree occurred in 7 of 425 patients (1.6%). The majority of the operations were performed via a transhiatal approach (87.8%). Patients with airway injuries were older (median 73 vs. 63), more likely to have squamous cell carcinoma (85.7% vs. 17.9%), and with proximal tumors (85.7% vs. 14.1%). When given, the type of neoadjuvant treatment consisted of chemoradiotherapy in all patients who suffered an injury, whereas it was only administered to 21.3% of patients without an injury. There were no deaths among three patients in whom the injury was identified intraoperatively. Mortality occurred in three of four patients (75.0%) with an injury detected postoperatively.Patients with proximal tumors and radiation administration as a component of neoadjuvant treatment are more likely to suffer a tracheobronchial injury. An aggressive reoperative approach is warranted in patients with injuries that are discovered postoperatively.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535950","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.524594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.455496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.452515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.345146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Miami","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Tracheobronchial tree","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheobronchial_tree"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Discovery (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 425","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_425"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Omen","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen"},{"name":"Tracheobronchial injury","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheobronchial_injury"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"}]}
