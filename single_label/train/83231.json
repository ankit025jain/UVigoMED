{"id":83231,"title":"Effectiveness of radiofrequency cryptolysis for the treatment of halitosis due to caseums.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) cryptolysis for caseum-induced halitosis.Clinical retrospective study.Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Department of Konya Training and Research Hospital in Turkey.Thirty-four patients with caseum-induced halitosis were included. Eight were male (23.5%) and 26 were female (76.5%). Their mean age was 28.29 ± 9.3 (range: 17-48) years. The mean duration of complaint of halitosis before RF cryptolysis was 53.41 ± 42.6 months (range: 6-182 months). The Finkelstein test, organoleptic measurements, and visual analog scale (VAS) were performed before and 12 months after RF cryptolysis.Before RF cryptolysis, all patients had a positive Finkelstein's test result, organoleptic measurements revealed that three (8.82%) had serious halitosis, 24 (70.58%) had average halitosis, and seven (20.58%) had mild halitosis, and the mean VAS score was 6.82 ± 1.45. The follow-up period after RF cryptolysis was 12 months. After the single RF cryptolysis session, 26 patients (76.47%) were negative for Finkelstein's test, organoleptic assessments revealed that 26 (76.47%), six (17.64%), and two (5.88%) showed complete, partial, and no recovery, respectively, (p<0.001), and the mean VAS score was significantly better at 1.88 ± 2.5 (p<0.001). Thirty-two patients (94.1%) exhibited a decrease in VAS score.RF cryptolysis is a cost-effective, safe, and easily applicable modality for the treatment of halitosis due to caseums in the crypts of the palatine tonsils.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406119","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.531715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.457819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Tonsil","weight":0.109342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsil"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Halitosis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halitosis"},{"name":"Konya","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konya"},{"name":"Palatine tonsil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_tonsil"},{"name":"Sensory system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Analog signal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"1748","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1748"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Complaint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Visual arts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"}]}
