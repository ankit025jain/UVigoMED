{"id":66157,"title":"Enzalutamide monotherapy in hormone-naive prostate cancer: primary analysis of an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study.","abstract":"The androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide is approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that has progressed on docetaxel. Our aim was to assess the activity and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy in men with hormone-naive prostate cancer.67 men were enrolled into the study. 62 patients (92.5%, 95% CI 86.2-98.8) had a decline in PSA of 80% or greater at week 25. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events up to week 25 were gynaecomastia (n=24), fatigue (n=23), nipple pain (n=13), and hot flush (n=12), all of which were of mild to moderate severity. Nine patients had a treatment-emergent adverse event of grade 3 or higher, most of which were reported in one patient each, except for pneumonia (grade 3, two patients) and hypertension (grade 3, four patients). Five patients reported serious adverse events, none of which were deemed to be treatment related.Our findings suggest that enzalutamide monotherapy in men with hormone-naive prostate cancer of varying severity provides a level of disease suppression, and was generally well tolerated. These findings provide a rationale for further investigation of clinical response and outcomes with enzalutamide in non-castrate men with prostate cancer.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739897","annotations":[{"name":"Gynecomastia","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecomastia"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nipple","weight":0.737756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.694157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Hot flash","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_flash"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.578049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0968837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0933533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Flushing (physiology)","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_(physiology)"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
