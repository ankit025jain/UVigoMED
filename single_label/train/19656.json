{"id":19656,"title":"Endothelial progenitor cells and a stromal cell-derived factor-1? analogue synergistically improve survival in sepsis.","abstract":"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been associated with human sepsis but their role is incompletely understood. Stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1? facilitates EPC recruitment and is elevated in murine sepsis models. Previous studies have demonstrated that the SDF-1? analog CTCE-0214 (CTCE) is beneficial in polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice.We hypothesized that exogenously administered EPCs are also beneficial in CLP sepsis and that CTCE provides synergistic benefit.Mice were subjected to CLP and administered EPCs at varying doses, CTCE, or a combination of the two. Mouse survival, plasma miRNA expression, IL-10 production, and lung vascular leakage were determined. The in vitro effect of CTCE on miRNA expression and EPC function were determined.Survival was improved with EPC therapy at a threshold of 10(6) cells. In coculture studies, EPCs augmented LPS-induced macrophage IL-10 production. In vivo EPC administration in sepsis increased plasma IL-10, suppressed lung vascular leakage, attenuated liver and kidney injury, and augmented miR-126 and -125b expression, which regulate endothelial cell function and/or inflammation. When subthreshold numbers of EPCs were coadministered with CTCE in CLP mice they synergistically improved survival. We demonstrated that CTCE recruits endogenous EPCs in septic mice. In in vitro analysis, CTCE enhanced EPC proliferation, angiogenesis, and prosurvival signaling while inhibiting EPC senescence. These cellular effects were, in part, explained by the effect of CTCE on miR-126, -125b, -34a, and -155 expression in EPCs.EPCs and CTCE represent important potential therapeutic strategies in sepsis.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
