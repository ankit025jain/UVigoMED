{"id":62870,"title":"Role of endoscopy in GERD.","abstract":"Endoscopy is commonly performed for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Endoscopy allows the physician to evaluate esophageal mucosa for evidence of esophagitis and Barrett esophagus, to obtain mucosal biopsies for evaluation of such conditions as eosinophilic esophagitis and diagnosis and grading of Barrett esophagus, and to apply various therapies. In a patient with suboptimal response to GERD therapy, endoscopy excludes other etiologies as a cause of patients' symptoms. Newer endoscopic therapies for GERD are available or are in development. Advances in imaging techniques in development will improve the diagnostic yield of endoscopy and may replace the need for mucosal biopsies.
