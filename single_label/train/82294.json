{"id":82294,"title":"Alveolar ridge preservation immediately after tooth extraction.","abstract":"Ridge preservation procedures immediately after tooth extraction, are commonly used with a view to minimising remodelling and shrinkage of the alveolar ridge, associated with socket healing. These procedures may sometimes be effective, but they cannot completely prevent reduction in dimension of the ridge. Certain biomater als used may actually hamper normal deposition of bone within the healing socket, reducing bone trabeculae that can integrate with the implant surface. However, in extraction sockets in alveolar ridges of low bone density, particles of implanted bone substitute incorporated in the healing bone, may enhance the mechanical support for the implant, provided by normal healed bone of low trabecular density alone. This paper reviews biological rationales and procedures for ridge preservation immediately after extraction and comments on their clinical use.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660412","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.782034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.297819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.289636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.161574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Alveolar ridge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.0176659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Deposition (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(geology)"},{"name":"Ridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Trabecula","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecula"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Fingerprint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hamper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamper"},{"name":"Dental alveolus","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_alveolus"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"}]}
