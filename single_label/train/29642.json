{"id":29642,"title":"Type 2 ryanodine receptors are highly sensitive to alcohol.","abstract":"Exposure to ethanol levels reached in circulation during alcohol intoxication (>10mM) constricts cerebral arteries in rats and humans. Remarkably, targets and mechanisms underlying this action remain largely unidentified. Artery diameter is regulated by myocyte Ca(2+) sparks, a vasodilatory signal contributed to by type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2). Using laser confocal microscopy in rat cerebral arteries and bilayer electrophysiology we unveil that ethanol inhibits both Ca(2+) spark and RyR2 activity with IC50<20 mM, placing RyR2 among the ion channels that are most sensitive to ethanol. Alcohol directly targets RyR2 and its lipid microenvironment, leading to stabilization of RyR2 closed states.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631538","annotations":[{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.588761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Lipid bilayer","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.461191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.440777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.279142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Miosis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miosis"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Electric arc","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc"}]}
