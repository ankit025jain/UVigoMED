{"id":4767,"title":"Seroprevalence of measles-specific antibodies in the group predominantly affected by measles in 2006-2009 in Poland.","abstract":"Irrespective of the high vaccination coverage against measles, sporadic measles outbreaks still occur in Poland. In 2006-2009, a slight increase in the number of measles cases was observed. Of these cases, people born in 1976-198 9 were predominantly affected.The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunity to measles in the aforesaid age group.The serum samples were selected from the serum bank in which material collected from the general population living in 5 provinces in Poland is stored. These samples were collected from patients hospitalized due to emergencies in 2010-2011. The antibody titre against measles was determined in each serum sample by ELISA test (Genzyme Virotech). Linear regression models using log-transformed antibody titres were used to compare the values.The serum samples collected from 483 persons, including 111 females and 372 males were tested. All patients had antibody titres exceeding 0.5 IU/ml. The antibody titre was statistically significantly associated with the vaccination coverage in each age group in particular province.The results of this study suggest good immunity to measles in the general population in Poland. The disparities between randomly selected provinces demonstrated a relation with the coverage rates as well as the differences in measles incidence which is observed recently between these provinces.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25391004","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.867825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Measles","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.811578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.698873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.610337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.501689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.292283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.22988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Genzyme","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genzyme"},{"name":"Bank","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"372","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"}]}
