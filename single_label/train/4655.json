{"id":4655,"title":"Timing of Class III treatment with unfavorable growth pattern.","abstract":"When treating youngpatients with Class III malocclusion, factors such as timing and an accurate prediction of growth of the mandible are very important. Even though early interceptive treatment of Class III might often be successful, clinicians should be careful to not initiate early treatment with premolar extractions which will compromise the success of orthognathic surgery later due to mandibular prognathism. This case report presents an adolescent female patient who developed a severe Class III skeletal discrepancy during growth and was treated with surgery after her growth had finished.","date":"2015-01-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25571692","annotations":[{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.849269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.76194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.314715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.312859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Prognathism","weight":0.309541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognathism"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.220329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orthognathic surgery","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
