{"id":82863,"title":"Lateral spread response monitoring during microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm. Comparison of two targets of partial neuromuscular blockade.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to determine (1) whether successful intraoperative electromyography monitoring for lateral spread response (LSR) is possible with partial neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in subjects undergoing microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm and (2) the adequate level of NMB to achieve that goal.A total of 61 patients in whom LSR was monitored during MVD were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups: group TOF in which the NMB target was maintenance of two train-of-four (TOF) counts and group T1 in which the NMB target was maintenance of a T1/Tc ratio of 50?% (T1: first twitch height of TOF and Tc: control twitch height). The adductor pollicis brevis muscle was used to monitor TOF responses. The frequency of successful LSR monitoring, defined as successful baseline establishment and maintenance of LSR until surgical decompression, was compared between the two groups.Of the 61 patients 2 were excluded from the study so that 30 patients in group TOF and 29 patients in group T1 were analyzed. The success rate of LSR monitoring was clinically acceptable and significantly higher in group T1 than in group TOF, i.e. n?=?15 (50.0?%) in group TOF versus n?=?24 (82.8?%) in group T1 (P?=?0.008), corresponding to a 32.8?% higher success rate in group T1 than group TOF (95?% CI: 13.9-51.7?%). Mean vecuronium infusion dose was smaller and mean TOF count was higher in group T1 than group TOF with a TOF count =?2 (1) in group TOF versus 3 (1) in group T1 (P?=?0.003). Mean sevoflurane and remifentanil infusion doses were not different between groups. There was no incidence of spontaneous movement during microscopy in either group.Maintenance of partial NMB with a target T1/Tc ratio of 50?% resulted in a clinically acceptable success rate of LSR monitoring and surgical condition during MVD. Maintenance of partial NMB with a target T1/Tc ratio of 50?% rather than TOF count of two during LSR monitoring for MVD can therefore be recommended.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499959","annotations":[{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.686781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.486326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Neuromuscular-blocking drug","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular-blocking_drug"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.251211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.149853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vecuronium bromide","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vecuronium_bromide"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Russia)"},{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Remifentanil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remifentanil"},{"name":"Hemifacial spasm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemifacial_spasm"},{"name":"Microvascular decompression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microvascular_decompression"},{"name":"Adductor pollicis muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adductor_pollicis_muscle"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"951","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/951"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Time-of-flight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Decompressive craniectomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompressive_craniectomy"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"}]}
