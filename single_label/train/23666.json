{"id":23666,"title":"Investigation of increased listeriosis revealed two fishery production plants with persistent Listeria contamination in Finland in 2010.","abstract":"In 2010, a marked increase in listeriosis incidence was observed in Finland. Listeria monocytogenes PFGE profile 96 was responsible for one-fifth of the reported cases and a cluster of PFGE profile 62 was also detected. Investigations revealed two fishery production plants with persistent Listeria contamination. It appears likely that the plants were at least partly responsible for the increase of listeriosis. Epidemiological investigation revealed that 57% (31/54) of cases with underlying immunosuppressive condition or medication reported eating gravad or cold-smoked fish. Two public notices were issued by THL and Evira informing which groups were most at risk from the effects of listeriosis and should therefore be cautious in consuming certain products. Systematic sampling of foods and adequate epidemiological investigation methods are required to identify the sources of Listeria infections. Continuous control measures at fishery production plants producing risk products are essential.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476659","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.599344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.531469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.457443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.399857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Listeria monocytogenes","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Fishery","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery"},{"name":"Listeriosis","weight":0.0783118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeriosis"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.0555992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Systematic sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_sampling"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Thomas H.
