{"id":53277,"title":"?1-Antitrypsin therapy downregulates toll-like receptor-induced IL-1? responses in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells and may improve islet function in recently diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"Recent studies have implicated proinflammatory responses in the mechanism of type 1 diabetes (T1D).Our objective was to evaluate the safety and effects of therapy with the anti-inflammatory serum protein ?1-antitrypsin (AAT) on islet function and innate immunity in recent-onset patients.This was an open-label phase I trial at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver.Twelve recently diagnosed subjects with T1D with detectable C-peptides were included in the study.Eight consecutive weekly infusions of 80 mg/kg of AAT were given.PATIENTS were monitored for adverse effects of AAT therapy, C-peptide responses to a mixed-meal tolerance test, and toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cellular IL-1? in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs).No adverse effects were detected. AAT led to increased, unchanged, or moderately reduced levels of C-peptide responses compared with baseline in 5 patients. The total content of TLR4-induced cellular IL-1? in monocytes at 12 months after AAT therapy was 3-fold reduced compared with baseline (P < .05). Furthermore, at baseline, 82% of monocytes produced IL-1?, but at 12 months after therapy, the level decreased to 42%. Similar reductions were observed using TLR7/8 and TLR3 agonists in monocytes and mDCs. Unexpectedly, the reduction in cellular IL-1? was observed only 9 and 12 months after treatment but not in untreated diabetics. Improved ?-cell function in the 5 AAT-treated individuals correlated with lower frequencies of monocytes and mDCs producing IL-1? compared with subjects without improvement of islet function (P < .04 and P < .02, respectively).We hypothesize that AAT may have a beneficial effect on T1D in recently diagnosed patients that is associated with downmodulation of IL-1?.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527714","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.747791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"TLR 4","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_4"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.633112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.620004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.50717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.348417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.330405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.269889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.129334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.105601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Alpha 1-antitrypsin","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_1-antitrypsin"},{"name":"Colorado","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Denver","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver"}]}
