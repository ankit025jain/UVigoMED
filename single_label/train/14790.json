{"id":14790,"title":"Hypoxic-state estimation of brain cells by using wireless near-infrared spectroscopy.","abstract":"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a modern measuring technology in neuroscience. It can be used to noninvasively measure the relative concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (DeoHb), which can reflect information related to cerebral blood volume and cerebral oxygen saturation. Therefore, it has the potential for noninvasive monitoring of cerebral ischemia. However, there is still a lack of reliable physiological information on the relationship between the concentrations of OxyHb and DeoHb in cerebral blood and the exact hypoxic state of brain cells under cerebral ischemia. In this study, we describe a wireless multichannel NIRS system, which we designed to noninvasively monitor the relative concentrations of OxyHb and DeoHb in bilateral cerebral blood before, during, and after middle cerebral artery occlusion. By comparing the results with the lactate/pyruvate ratio measured by microdialysis, we investigated the correlation between the relative concentrations of OxyHb and DeoHb in cerebral blood and the hypoxic state of brain cells. The results showed that the relationship between the concentration changes of DeoHb in cerebral blood and the hypoxic state of brain cells was significant. Therefore, by monitoring the changes in concentrations of DeoHb, the wireless NIRS can be used to estimate the hypoxic state of brain cells indirectly.
