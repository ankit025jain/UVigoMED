{"id":67432,"title":"Novel combination markers for predicting survival in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer: USP18 and DGCR2.","abstract":"We performed gene expression profiling in bladder cancer patients to identify cancer-specific survival-related genes in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients. Sixty-two patients with MIBC were selected as the original cohort and another 118 MIBC patients were chosen as a validation cohort. The expression of USP18, DGCR2, and ZNF699 genes were measured and we analyzed the association between gene signatures and survival. USP18 and DGCR2, were significantly correlated to cancer-specific death (P=0.020, P=0.007, respectively). Cancer-specific survival in the low USP18 or DGCR2 expression group was significantly longer than the high expression group (P=0.018, P=0.006, respectively). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, a combination of USP18 and DGCR2 mRNA expression levels were significant risk factors for cancer-specific death (HR, 2.106; CI, 1.043-4.254, P=0.038). Overall survival and cancer-specific survival rates in the low-combination group were significantly longer than those in the high-expression group (P=0.001, both). In conclusion, decreased expressions of USP18 and DGCR2 were significantly associated with longer cancer-specific survival, and also the combination of two genes was correlated to a longer survival for MIBC patients. Thus, the combination of USP18 and DGCR2 expression was shown to be a reliable prognostic marker for cancer-specific survival in MIBC.
