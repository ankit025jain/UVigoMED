{"id":81809,"title":"Bilateral stellate ganglion blockade for recalcitrant oral pain from Burning Mouth Syndrome: a case report.","abstract":"Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a chronic painful disorder characterized by unremitting bilateral burning oral pain often associated with taste abnormalities and complaints of dry mouth. The diagnosis is made by history and symptom presentation in the absence of an identifiable cause or oral lesion. It is commonly seen in perimenopausal women but is also seen in men, and is considered a small-fiber neuropathy. Management can be challenging and few effective treatments are available. This article presents a case report of stellate ganglion blockade as a treatment for recalcitrant pain from BMS.
