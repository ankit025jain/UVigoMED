{"id":50382,"title":"Prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents from 2001 to 2009.","abstract":"Despite concern about an \"epidemic,\" there are limited data on trends in prevalence of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes across US race and ethnic groups.To estimate changes in the prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US youth, by sex, age, and race/ethnicity between 2001 and 2009.Case patients were ascertained in 4 geographic areas and 1 managed health care plan. The study population was determined by the 2001 and 2009 bridged-race intercensal population estimates for geographic sites and membership counts for the health plan.Prevalence (per 1000) of physician-diagnosed type 1 diabetes in youth aged 0 through 19 years and type 2 diabetes in youth aged 10 through 19 years.In 2001, 4958 of 3.3 million youth were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a prevalence of 1.48 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.44-1.52). In 2009, 6666 of 3.4 million youth were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a prevalence of 1.93 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.88-1.97). In 2009, the highest prevalence of type 1 diabetes was 2.55 per 1000 among white youth (95% CI, 2.48-2.62) and the lowest was 0.35 per 1000 in American Indian youth (95% CI, 0.26-0.47) and type 1 diabetes increased between 2001 and 2009 in all sex, age, and race/ethnic subgroups except for those with the lowest prevalence (age 0-4 years and American Indians). Adjusted for completeness of ascertainment, there was a 21.1% (95% CI, 15.6%-27.0%) increase in type 1 diabetes over 8 years. In 2001, 588 of 1.7 million youth were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a prevalence of 0.34 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.31-0.37). In 2009, 819 of 1.8 million were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a prevalence of 0.46 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.43-0.49). In 2009, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 1.20 per 1000 among American Indian youth (95% CI, 0.96-1.51); 1.06 per 1000 among black youth (95% CI, 0.93-1.22); 0.79 per 1000 among Hispanic youth (95% CI, 0.70-0.88); and 0.17 per 1000 among white youth (95% CI, 0.15-0.20). Significant increases occurred between 2001 and 2009 in both sexes, all age-groups, and in white, Hispanic, and black youth, with no significant changes for Asian Pacific Islanders and American Indians. Adjusted for completeness of ascertainment, there was a 30.5% (95% CI, 17.3%-45.1%) overall increase in type 2 diabetes.Between 2001 and 2009 in 5 areas of the United States, the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents increased. Further studies are required to determine the causes of these increases.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794371","annotations":[{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.753216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.72649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.640157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Native Americans in the United States","weight":0.609645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Pacific Islander","weight":0.501387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islander"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.486404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.45027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.449404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.389795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.319056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.31207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.251152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.188088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health policy","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Pacific Ocean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"},{"name":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"New York Islanders","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Islanders"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Igbo people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people"},{"name":"Asian Pacific American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Pacific_American"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"U.S. Route 441","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_441"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Managed care","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_care"}]}
