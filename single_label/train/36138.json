{"id":36138,"title":"Cardiovascular abnormalities in Taiwanese patients with mucopolysaccharidosis.","abstract":"The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of rare inherited metabolic diseases that can cause damages in various organs including the heart. This study aimed to review the medical records of Taiwanese patients with MPS in order to evaluate the cardiovascular involvement in those patients.From 2000 to 2012, the medical records of 60 patients with MPS in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan were retrospectively reviewed. Data on cardiac measurements and functions were obtained from previously performed echocardiograms and electrocardiograms. Cardiac parameters were analyzed according to MPS types and patients' age.The most frequent MPS type was type II (43%). Overall, heart conditions such as thick interventricular septum (55%), asymmetric septal hypertrophy (42%) and mitral valve prolapse (33%) were common, while cardiac enlargement was infrequently seen. Valvular stenosis/regurgitation and cardiac hypertrophy were more common in patients with MPS I, II, and VI when compared with other MPS types. Cardiovascular abnormalities including valvular deformation and thickening, thick interventricular septum and diastolic dysfunction were found to progress with age.The anatomical changes of cardiovascular systems were common in all types of MPS patients, especially in MPS I, II, and VI. Echocardiography and electrocardiography can provide us good tools for early detection and long-term follow-up for these patients.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal
