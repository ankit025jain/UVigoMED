{"id":61723,"title":"IL2/IL-4, OX40L and FDC-like cell line support the in vitro tumor cell growth of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","abstract":"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a peripheral T-cell neoplasm with an extremely poor prognosis. Maintaining ATLL cells in vitro is difficult and little is known about how they maintain themselves or grow in patients. Elucidating the interaction between ATLL cells and surrounding host factors might therefore provide important insights into pathophysiology. We cultured primary ATLL cells in various culture conditions using IL-2, IL-4 and feeder cells, and established two cell lines dependent on IL-2, IL-4 and a follicular dendritic cell-derived cell line, HK, in which OX40-ligand was induced. Our study indicates the importance of microenvironment in the homeostasis of ATLL.
