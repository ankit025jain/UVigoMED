{"id":80103,"title":"[Investigation of prevalence of soil-transmitted nematode infections among Lahu Ethnic residents in Xiaojie Township, Jinghong City, Yunnan Province].","abstract":"To understand the prevalence of human intestinal parasite infections in Lahu Ethnic residents so as to provide the evidence for effective control.The prevalence of soil-transmitted nematode infections in local people was determined by Kato-Katz technique and individual sanitary behaviors and habits were requested by a standardized questionnaire in 3 villages of Xiaojie Township, Jinghong City, Yunnan Province. The relationship between intestinal parasite infections and behavioral characteristics was analyzed.Of 289 subjects, 255 individuals were infected with soil-transmitted nematodes; the prevalence was 88.24%. Among the infected individuals, 210 were found infected with hookworm and the infection rate was 72.66%; 154 subjects were infected with Ascaris lumbricoides and the infection rate was 53.29%; 13 were infected with Trichuris trichura, and the infection rate was 4.50%; 16 were infected with other parasites and the infection rate was 5.54%. The percentages of people with light infection of hookworm, A. lumbricoides and T. trichura were 90.48%, 97.40% and 100%, respectively.There is high prevalence of soil-transmitted nematode infections in Lahu Ethnic residents in Jinghong City, but the infection intensity was generally low. The control and monitoring of soil-transmitted parasite infections should be strengthened in this area.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800574","annotations":[{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.933194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Intestinal parasite","weight":0.890905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_parasite"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Ascaris lumbricoides","weight":0.798868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.794137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.746674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.636446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.562025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.39465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.25322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Trichinosis","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis"},{"name":"Yunnan","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan"},{"name":"Lahu people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahu_people"},{"name":"Jinghong","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinghong"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"255","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Township (New Jersey)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township_(New_Jersey)"}]}
