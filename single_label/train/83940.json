{"id":83940,"title":"Effect of preoperative P2Y12 and thrombin platelet receptor inhibition on bleeding after cardiac surgery.","abstract":"Drugs that act on the platelet P2Y12 receptor are responsible for postoperative bleeding in cardiac surgery. However, protease-activated receptor (PAR) that reacts to thrombin stimulation might still be active in patients treated with P2Y12 inhibitors. Preoperative platelet function testing could possibly guide the timing of surgery. We investigated the association between P2Y12 receptor and PAR inhibition and bleeding after cardiac surgery.A retrospective cohort study of 361 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and treated with P2Y12 anti-platelet agents was undertaken. All patients received a preoperative multiplate electrode aggregometry testing of platelet P2Y12 receptor activity (ADPtest) and PAR reactivity with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) stimulation. ADPtest and TRAPtest data measured before surgery were analysed for association with postoperative bleeding (ml per 12 h) and severe postoperative bleeding.Both the ADPtest and the TRAPtest were significantly (P=0.001) associated with postoperative bleeding. A threshold of 22 U for the ADPtest yielded a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 20%, and a threshold of 75 U for the TRAPtest yielded an NPV of 95% and a PPV of 23%. In the subgroup of patients with ADPtest <22 U, TRAPtest ?75 U was not associated with severe bleeding (NPV of 100% and PPV of 37%).In patients taking P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, residual platelet reactivity to thrombin stimulation limits the risk of severe postoperative bleeding.","date":"2014-11-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25209096","annotations":[{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.78188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.599312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.399718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.350551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.313213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.0427644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartrate-resistant_acid_phosphatase"},{"name":"P2Y receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2Y_receptor"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Toyota Y engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Y_engine"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"P2Y12","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2Y12"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Net present value","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"}]}
