{"id":55925,"title":"Functional and anatomical outcome of eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with intravitreal ranibizumab following an exit strategy regimen.","abstract":"To assess the functional and morphological outcome of eyes with neovascular AMD treated with intravitreal ranbizumab following an exit strategy treatment regime.The Bern treatment regime for neovascular AMD has a fixed injection schedule, even in the non-active stage of the disease. The regimen has been adapted from the PIER study treatment protocol. Eyes with non-active AMD will receive 4 injections in the first year, and 2 injections in the second year of follow-up before treatment stops. Patients that received ranibizumab for treatment and reached the exit criteria were identified, and charts were reviewed to assess functional and morphological outcome.Only 2.6% of all patients (15 out of 575 patients) reached the exit criteria. Mean change in best corrected ETDRS visual acuity (VA) was 4.5±16.9 letters when comparing baseline VA to 4?weeks after the last injection (p=0.32). OCT mean foveal thickness was significantly thinner after last treatment (247.9±43.0?µm) compared to baseline (332.5±83.1?µm, p=0.002). The mean total number of ranibizumab injections was 15.6±8.0, and the mean total treatment period was 40.9±18.3?months. Twenty percent of eyes had geographic atrophy present at baseline versus 46.6% at the end of treatment.Even with a fixed treatment regime and a defined treatment exit strategy, only a small percentage of patients reach exit criteria. Retinal thickness has been significantly reduced by repeated intravitreal ranibizumab injections, and geographic atrophy became more frequent.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782472","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.786631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.321041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.304374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.194581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Bern","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bern"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"943","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/943"},{"name":"247","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247"},{"name":"918","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/918"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Exit strategy","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_strategy"}]}
