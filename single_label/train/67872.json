{"id":67872,"title":"Renal cell carcinoma in Ibadan: a 5-year clinicopathologic review.","abstract":"To review all the cases of the patients with renal cell carcinoma seen during the study period and to determine the pattern of presentation, number of operable cases, histological types and outcome of treatment.The data of the patients with renal cell carcinoma was retrieved from the Urology division audit book, theatre record books and case files from the health records department and pathology register in the department of pathology. The parameters studied were age, gender, pattern of presentation, number of patients who had surgery, histology types and the outcome of treatment.In total, there were 69 patients with renal cell carcinoma that accounted for 59.5% of all renal masses seen. The male to female ratio was 1:1. Their age ranged from 16 to 88 with a mean of 48 years and median of 50 years. The main clinical feature was loin swelling (100%) and others were loin pain (29%), hematuria (18.8%), weight loss (4%) and paraneoplastic syndrome (anaemia without haematuria) was seen in 2.9%. Ten percent of the cases had the classical triad of hematuria, loin pain and loin swelling. All cases were unilateral disease and 15 (21.7%) had metastasis at presentation. The pre-operative tests were abdominal ultrasound (94%), intravenous urography (45%) and CT-Scan (11.6%). Twenty eight patients (40.6%) had surgery of which 5 were unresectable. 37 of the patients (53.6%) were subsequently lost to follow-up. The 28 operative specimens were histologically confirmed and 85.7% were clear cell carcinoma. The 23 patients whose tumours were resected have remained symptom free, some up to 5 years. However the five patients with unresectable tumours died between 3 to 6 months of exploratory surgery.The patients with resectable tumour could remain disease free for a significant period afterwards despite late presentation. However, there is a high loss to follow-up rate.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579385","annotations":[{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Paraneoplastic syndrome","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraneoplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Intravenous pyelogram","weight":0.86732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_pyelogram"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.538165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
