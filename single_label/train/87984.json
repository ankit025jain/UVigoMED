{"id":87984,"title":"Effect of negative pressure wound therapy on wound healing.","abstract":"The efficacy of NPWT in promoting wound healing has been largely accepted by clinicians, yet the number of high-level clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness is small and much more can be learned about the mechanisms of action. In the future, hopefully we will have the data to assist clinicians in selecting optimal parameters for specific wounds including interface material, waveform of suction application, and the amount of suction to be applied. Further investigation into specific interface coatings and instillation therapy are also needed. We believe that advances in mechanobiology, the science of wound healing, the understanding of biofilms, and advances in cell therapy will lead to better care for our patients.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935079","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.770567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.656392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.614275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Negative pressure wound therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_pressure_wound_therapy"},{"name":"Waveform","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Instillation abortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instillation_abortion"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"}]}
