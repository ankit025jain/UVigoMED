{"id":56658,"title":"Viral retinitis following intraocular or periocular corticosteroid administration: a case series and comprehensive review of the literature.","abstract":"To describe viral retinitis following intravitreal and periocular corticosteroid administration.Retrospective case series and comprehensive literature review.We analyzed 5 unreported and 25 previously published cases of viral retinitis following local corticosteroid administration. Causes of retinitis included 23 CMV (76.7%), 5 HSV (16.7%), and 1 each VZV and unspecified (3.3%). Two of 22 tested patients (9.1%) were HIV positive. Twenty-one of 30 (70.0%) cases followed one or more intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (TA), 4 (13.3%) after one or more posterior sub-Tenon injections of TA, 3 (10.0%) after placement of a 0.59-mg fluocinolone acetonide implant (Retisert), and 1 (3.3%) each after an anterior subconjunctival injection of TA (together with IVTA), an anterior chamber injection, and an anterior sub-Tenon injection. Mean time from most recent corticosteroid administration to development of retinitis was 4.2 months (median 3.8; range 0.25-13.0). Twelve patients (40.0%) had type II diabetes mellitus. Treatments used included systemic antiviral agents (26/30, 86.7%), intravitreal antiviral injections (20/30, 66.7%), and ganciclovir intravitreal implants (4/30, 13.3%).Viral retinitis may develop or reactivate following intraocular or periocular corticosteroid administration. Average time to development of retinitis was 4 months, and CMV was the most frequently observed agent. Diabetes was a frequent co-morbidity and several patients with uveitis who developed retinitis were also receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655372","annotations":[{"name":"Ganciclovir","weight":0.90416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganciclovir"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.901267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.845212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Triamcinolone","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Varicella zoster virus","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.502722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.424789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Acetone","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Fluocinolone acetonide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluocinolone_acetonide"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Triamcinolone acetonide","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone_acetonide"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Retinitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
