{"id":53474,"title":"Assessment of characteristics of neointimal hyperplasia after drug-eluting stent implantation in patients with diabetes mellitus: an optical coherence tomography analysis.","abstract":"This study aims to assess the characteristics of neointimal hyperplasia after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) by optical coherence tomography (OCT).OCT was performed in 109 patients (45 with DM and 64 without DM) 1 year after DES implantation. Neointimal coverage and thickness on the luminal side were measured. The characteristics of neointimal hyperplasia were classified into three patterns, namely, high signal pattern, low signal pattern and layered signal pattern, according to the neointimal signal intensity. The development of in-stent neoatherosclerosis was also examined. In the DM group, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were analyzed in order to assess their contribution to neointimal characteristics.OCT results indicated that neointimal thickness was thicker in the DM group than in the non-DM group (177.19 ± 165.36 vs. 166.76 ± 132.38 ?m, p < 0.001). Lower incidence of high signal pattern (58.33 vs. 75.34%, p = 0.037) and higher incidence of in-stent neoatherosclerosis (18.33 vs. 5.48%, p = 0.027) were observed in the DM group. In the DM subgroup with HbA1c >7%, significantly higher incidence of low signal pattern (37.50 vs. 21.43%, p = 0.001) and layered signal pattern (18.75 vs. 3.57%, p = 0.001) and lower incidence of high signal pattern were observed (43.75 vs. 75.0%, p < 0.001). In-stent neoatherosclerosis was also frequently detected in the high HbA1c group compared with the low HbA1c group (28.13 vs. 7.14%, p = 0.048).Neointimal characteristics differed between DM and non-DM patients. HbA1c levels in DM patients contributed to the development of neointimal hyperplasia and in-stent neoatherosclerosis.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24514877","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.877853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.549478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.41458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.324282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.103496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Data Encryption Standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.0149239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
