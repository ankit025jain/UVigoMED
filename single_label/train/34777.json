{"id":34777,"title":"[Complex congenital clubfoot: a case report].","abstract":"The Ponseti method is the ideal treatment for the management of congenital clubfoot of any etiology; it corrects the deformity in more than 90% of cases. However, a small percent of idiopathic clubfoot cases, known as complex clubfoot, do not respond properly to this treatment and thus a modification of the original technique described by Doctor Ponseti for manipulating the forefoot is required. We present herein the case of a patient with complex congenital clubfoot treated during her first year of life with the modified Ponseti method with good results.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707607","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.401538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.147074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Club foot","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_foot"},{"name":"Ponseti method","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponseti_method"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"}]}
