{"id":61874,"title":"Expression of CD11b as an adhesion molecule on neutrophils in children with Kawasaki disease.","abstract":"Inflammation of blood vessels is a characteristic feature of Kawasaki disease. Neutrophils play a key role in the inflammatory responses where movement of neutrophils toward the site of inflammation depends on CD11b/CD18 expression as adhesion molecules on these cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate CD11b/CD18 expression in patients with Kawasaki disease upon diagnosis and after treatment.The study included 20 children with Kawasaki disease aged from 3 months to 8 years. Mean fluorescence intensity of CD11b levels on diagnosis and at 1-2 and 6 weeks after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy was measured in these patients. Level of CD11b was measured in age-matched healthy children and febrile children (each 21) as negative and positive controls, respectively.Mean fluorescence intensity of CD11b in Kawasaki patients was lower than that of the control groups before and after 1-2 weeks of IVIG therapy. There were no significant differences in CD11b in Kawasaki patients either with aneurysm or without aneurysm. The CD11b levels at the diagnosis time and after treatment with IVIG in our patients with Kawasaki were lower than the control groups.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659162","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Kawasaki disease","weight":0.742039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.737113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.67938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.630393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.626425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Integrin alpha M","weight":0.624944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin_alpha_M"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.477896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.418034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.400501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
