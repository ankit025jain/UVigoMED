{"id":82042,"title":"Ultrasound and computed tomography features of primary acinic cell carcinoma in the parotid gland: a retrospective study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to characterize the ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) findings of primary acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) of the parotid gland.Seventy patients (70 lesions) with histopathologically proven AciCC underwent US or CT examination. The following characteristics were assessed on US images: size, shape, border, echogenicity, echotexture, internal structure, distal acoustic enhancement, and vascularity. The following characteristics were evaluated on CT images: size, shape, border, density, CT values on plain and contrast-enhanced scans, enhancement pattern, enhancement degree, and surrounding bone destruction.On US images, lesions were irregular, well-defined, hypoechoic, heterogeneous, and poorly vascularized. On CT images, lesions were regular and well-defined, and showed slight heterogeneous enhancement.These findings suggest that most primary AciCCs show benign features on US and CT.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736008","annotations":[{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.884072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.757147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.732099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.430893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.234495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.188149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Echogenicity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echogenicity"},{"name":"Acoustic enhancement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_enhancement"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Plain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
