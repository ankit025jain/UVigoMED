{"id":70449,"title":"Dendritic cell-targeted vaccines--hope or hype?","abstract":"The development of an effective vaccine that elicits a strong and durable T cell response against intracellular pathogens and cancer is a challenge. One strategy to enhance the effectiveness of vaccination is by targeting dendritic cells (DCs). In this Opinion article, we discuss existing DC-targeting approaches that induce adaptive immunity. We highlight the crucial issues that need to be addressed to move the field forward and discuss whether targeting DCs could be better than current vaccine approaches.
