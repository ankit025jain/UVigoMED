{"id":79183,"title":"Endoscopic endonasal technique: treatment of paranasal and anterior skull base malignancies.","abstract":"Technical and technological innovations have spearheaded the expansion of the indications for the use of endoscopic endonasal approaches to extirpate malignancies of the sinonasal tract and adjacent skull base.Critical review of the available literature regarding the use of endoscopic endonasal approaches including indications, limitations, surgical techniques, oncologic outcome, and quality of life.Various endoscopic endonasal techniques are reviewed according to the origin and local extension of sinonasal and skull base malignancies including anterior cranial base, nasopharynx, clivus, and infratemporal fossa. In addition, the available literature is reviewed to assess outcomes.Endoscopic endonasal approaches are an integral part of the armamentarium for the treatment of the sinonasal tract malignancies and skull base. In properly selected cases, it affords similar oncologic outcomes with lower morbidity than traditional open approaches. Nonetheless, these minimal access approaches should be considered a complement to well-established open approaches, which are still necessary in most advanced tumors.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474490","annotations":[{"name":"Nasopharynx","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharynx"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.626501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.567821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.430792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0425622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Infratemporal fossa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infratemporal_fossa"},{"name":"Clivus (anatomy)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clivus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Base of skull","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_of_skull"},{"name":"Local extinction","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction"}]}
