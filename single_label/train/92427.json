{"id":92427,"title":"Measuring function after hip and knee surgery: the evidence to support performance-based functional outcome tasks.","abstract":"Accurate, reproducible outcome measures are essential for the evaluation of any orthopaedic procedure, in both clinical practice and research. Commonly used patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have drawbacks such as 'floor' and 'ceiling' effects, limitations of worldwide adaptability and an inability to distinguish pain from function. They are also unable to measure the true outcome of an intervention rather than a patient's perception of that outcome. Performance-based functional outcome tools may address these problems. It is important that both clinicians and researchers are aware of these measures when dealing with high-demand patients, using a new intervention or implant, or testing a new rehabilitation protocol. This article provides an overview of some of the clinically-validated performance-based functional outcome tools used in the assessment of patients undergoing hip and knee surgery.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371452","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.761904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Ceiling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiling"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Programmable read-only memory","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_read-only_memory"}]}
