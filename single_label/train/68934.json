{"id":68934,"title":"[Postoperative male stress urinary incontinence: outcomes of treatment by I-STOP TOMS® transobturator sling].","abstract":"To evaluate the outcome of postoperative male stress urinary incontinence surgery using the I-STOP TOMS(®) sub-urethral sling.Between April 2007 and August 2012, 29 patients had been treated by sub-urethral sling. Stress urinary incontinence was classified as mild, moderate or severe according to the number of pads per day. Patients were also assessed thanks to IQOL, MHU and Ditrovie self-administered questionnaires.Before surgery, 16 patients (55.2%) had mild incontinence, 12 (41.4%) had moderate incontinence and one (3.4%) had severe incontinence. Preoperative median MHU was 9 (5-12); median IQOL was 73 (58-88); and median Ditrovie was 2.7 (2.1-3.3). Three months after surgery, median MHU was 7 (4-9); median IQOL was 85 (75-99); and median Ditrovie was 2.1 (1.6-2.4). Pre- and postoperative questionnaires scores show a significant improvement for IQOL (P=0.014) and Ditrovie (P<0.001). After 3 months, six patients were dry (20.7%), 19 patients had mild incontinence (65.5%) and four had moderate incontinence (13.8%); in résumé 17 patients (58.6%) showed a significant improvement in the number of pads (20.7% dry, 37.9% improved). After a mean follow-up of 24 ± 19.9 months, five patients were dry (17.2%), 20 patients (69%) had mild incontinence and four had moderate incontinence (13.8%).I-STOP TOMS(®) sub-urethral sling improved the level of postoperative stress urinary incontinence. However, the continence rate was weak.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485083","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.737222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Sanitary napkin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_napkin"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Sling (furniture)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(furniture)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
