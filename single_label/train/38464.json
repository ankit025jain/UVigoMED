{"id":38464,"title":"A leak too far--gastro-pleural fistula mimicking recurrence of repaired congenital diaphragmatic hernia following fundoplication.","abstract":"Recurrence rate after a congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair is high especially after a patch repair. Recurrence can be asymptomatic, followed by respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms and the diagnosis is usually confirmed radiologically. We present an unusual case of radiologically diagnosed recurrent left diaphragmatic hernia but at surgery was found to be a gastro-pleural fistula that occurred as a complication following fundoplication surgery.
