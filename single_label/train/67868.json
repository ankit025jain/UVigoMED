{"id":67868,"title":"Symbolic representations of living with chronic kidney disease.","abstract":"Visual or aesthetic data can contribute to understanding experiences that may not be able to be fully understood through spoken or written words. This article describes stories of symbols that represent the experiences of individuals living with chronic kidney disease. Symbols included both objects (i.e., a family photograph) and intangible representations (i.e., apiece of music) that were chosen because they innately held meaning to the person. Descriptive themes of the symbols included hopes and inspirations, reflections on \"who I am,\" and confrontations of illness. Participants' expressions through symbols were further described through the use of stories of memories, emotions, and poetic devices. We contend that symbols convey aspects of experience that cannot easily be translated into oral expression.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579398","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.424062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Symbol","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol"},{"name":"Music","weight":0.263238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.254754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.179976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.155186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.141968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.114516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Poetry","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Discworld (world)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_(world)"},{"name":"Figure of speech","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_speech"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Lobbying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"}]}
