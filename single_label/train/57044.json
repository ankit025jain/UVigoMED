{"id":57044,"title":"Computer-assisted reproductive surgery: why it matters to reproductive endocrinology and infertility subspecialists.","abstract":"Trained fertility specialists possess a unique clinical perspective and an extensive medical and technological armamentarium to overcome reproductive dysfunction: it is their privilege and ethical duty to lead the field of reproductive surgery. However, modern reproductive surgery can no longer exist outside of the realm of advanced laparoscopy. This has been a major hurdle to the thriving of surgery within our subspecialty, owing to the time and effort required to achieve and maintain proficiency in the anti-ergonomic environment of conventional laparoscopy. Computer-assisted surgery minimizes aptitudinal restrictions to the adoption of advanced laparoscopy. As such, it promotes strategy over technique and may hold the key to the continued success of high-specialty reproductive surgery.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274484","annotations":[{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.783879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.645947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.555837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.526727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Reproductive surgery","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_surgery"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Reproductive endocrinology and infertility","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_endocrinology_and_infertility"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Law of Privilege","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Privilege"},{"name":"Empire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Hurdle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdle"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Reproductive endocrinology","weight":0.0136018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_endocrinology"}]}
