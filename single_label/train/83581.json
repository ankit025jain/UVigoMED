{"id":83581,"title":"[Cytogenetic effects in the population in agricultural regions of the Kemerovo region].","abstract":"There was performed an analysis of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of the inhabitants of 9 settlements from 6 agricultural regions of the Kemerovo region. 267 children-adolescents and 124 adults not involved in the industry were examined. The average level of chromosomal aberrations was 2.65% in children and 3.35% in adults. It can be regarded as a background regional level. There was no revealed the modifying ability of such factors as gender age, presence of harmful habits (smoking) on the formation of the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in residents of rural areas of the Kemerovo region.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306708","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.488516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.393763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.371057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.370095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.240576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Kemerovo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemerovo"},{"name":"Peripheral blood lymphocyte","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_lymphocyte"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"267","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/267"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Human settlement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_settlement"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Agriculture in Brazil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Brazil"}]}
