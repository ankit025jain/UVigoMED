{"id":69696,"title":"Fragment-based screening of the bromodomain of ATAD2.","abstract":"Cellular and genetic evidence suggest that inhibition of ATAD2 could be a useful strategy to treat several types of cancer. To discover small-molecule inhibitors of the bromodomain of ATAD2, we used a fragment-based approach. Fragment hits were identified using NMR spectroscopy, and ATAD2 was crystallized with three of the hits identified in the fragment screen.
