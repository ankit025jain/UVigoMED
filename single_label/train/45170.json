{"id":45170,"title":"Meta-analysis of associations between the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? Pro12Ala polymorphism and susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine whether a Proline (Pro)-to-Alanine (Ala) exchange at codon 12 (Pro12Ala) polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR?) is associated with susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA).A meta-analysis was conducted on the association between the PPAR? Pro12Ala polymorphism and NAFLD, RA, and PsA.Nine studies, including five on NAFLD, two on RA, and two on PsA, were available for the meta-analysis consisting of 8082 cases and 3790 controls. The meta-analysis revealed no association between the Ala allele of the PPAR? Pro12Ala polymorphism and NAFLD (odds ratios [OR]=0.936, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.672-1.302, p=0.693). However, stratification by ethnicity indicated an association between the Ala allele and NAFLD in East Asians (OR=0.700, 95% CI=0.496-0.987, p=0.042), but not in Europeans (OR=1.128, 95% CI=0.863-1.475, p=0.378). Analysis using the dominant model showed the same Ala allele pattern in East Asians and Europeans (OR=0.688, 95% CI=0.484-0.978, p=0.037; OR=1.051, 95% CI=0.782-1.413, p=0.742), demonstrating a significant association between the Ala allele and NAFLD in East Asians. The meta-analysis revealed no association between the Ala allele and RA in East Asians (OR=0.467, 95% CI=0.188-1.161, p=0.101), and no association was found between the Ala allele and PsA in Europeans (OR=0.869, 95% CI=0.465-1.627, p=0.662).Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the PPAR? Pro12Ala polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to NAFLD in East Asians, but not in European populations.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697566","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.85226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.774507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.707902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","weight":0.673002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.667629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Proline","weight":0.601579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline"},{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Psoriatic arthritis","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriatic_arthritis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"1881","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1881"},{"name":"742","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/742"},{"name":"688","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/688"},{"name":"627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/627"},{"name":"378","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/378"},{"name":"662","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/662"},{"name":"869","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/869"},{"name":"987","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/987"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"East Asians","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asians"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"}]}
