{"id":84941,"title":"[Relations between duration of sleep, dietary patterns and the prevalence of overweight/obesity among 11-13 year-olds in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province of China].","abstract":"To describe the relationships between sleep duration, dietary patterns and overweight/obesity among adolescents in Xuzhou, and to develop prevention and intervention strategies for adolescent-obesity.Data of 3 103 boys and girls from 5 junior high schools were analyzed. Self-reported information on duration of sleep, dietary patterns, physical activities and time spent on watching video/audio program were assessed and physique data was also collected. Descriptive statistics, multiple liner regression and logistic regression models were used.The prevalence rates on overweight and obesity in boys were 23.5% and 22.5% , and in girls were 18.1% and 11.9%, respectively. Proportions of insufficient sleep (<8 h/d) in boys appeared 28.1% and in girls as 33.0% . From logistic regression analysis revealed that there appeared risk on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in boys who had sleep duration <7 h/d [OR(95% CI):1.72 (1.08-2.74)], but no significant association was found between duration of sleep and overweight/ obesity in girls. After adjusting on age, levels of parental education, family income, physical activities, time spent on watching video/audio programs, and weight status, boys who had sleep duration less than 7 h/d would have the odds ratio of 1.69 (1.10-2.73), for the likelihood of increasing the frequency of eating snacks compared to their counterparts who had sleep duration of ? 8 h/d.The Shortened duration of sleep seemed an independent risk factor on overweight/obesity among male adolescents, and it was associated with the increased frequency of eating snacks. Data from our study showed that the dietary patterns might play a role in the association between duration of sleep and overweight/ obesity, among male adolescents.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009024","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.675063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.674824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.610321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.593168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.468693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.33402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.331007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.318934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.134446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Jiangsu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu"},{"name":"Physical attractiveness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness"},{"name":"Snack food","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack_food"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0119516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
