{"id":28922,"title":"Treatment of refractory substance-induced psychosis in adolescent males with a genetic predisposition to mental illness.","abstract":"This article presents two cases of adolescent males who were admitted to our inpatient psychiatric unit with a psychotic, disorganized presentation. Both males had a genetic vulnerability to mental illness and reported significant substance use. Their symptoms were refractory to treatment and required the use of clozapine. Both patients experienced significant side effects, which limited the maximum daily dose of clozapine. However, they responded to a dose that was much lower than that typically used in adults. There is significant evidence in the literature about cannabis use triggering psychotic breaks in vulnerable individuals. We speculate that substance use (including synthetic cannabinoids) triggers treatment-resistant psychosis that requires the use of clozapine. Further, lower doses of clozapine may be sufficient to treat the substance-induced psychotic symptoms than those typically used in adult schizophrenia.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762642","annotations":[{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.89669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Psychosis","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.672841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.572774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Clozapine","weight":0.543186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozapine"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.54204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.532115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.490315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.4491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.336757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.228344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Speculation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation"},{"name":"Legality of cannabis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"}]}
