{"id":86699,"title":"[Comparison of modern methods of respiratory oxygenation during double level tracheal resection and reconstruction (clinical report)].","abstract":"The problem of respiratory support in tracheal surgery is still discussed in recent days. Anaesthesiologist must choose the most effective and safe respiratory technique during tracheal resection and reconstruction. The article deals with a case of comparison of apneic oxygenation (AO) and high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) during double level tracheal resection and reconstruction in patient with multifocal tracheal stenosis and underlying cerebral trauma.AO and HFJV were used due to surgical need for 20 min each technique. PvO2, PvCO2, hematocrit, blood glucose, acid-base balance in the v. Jugularis interna, noninvasive arterial pressure, heart rate, ECG and body temperature were fixed before and after the changing of respiratory support type. Additionally peak systolic speed (S) of blood flow in the a. Cerebralis media sinister was fixed by transcranial Doppler (\"Angiodin BIOSS\", Russia).Oxygenation of venous blood was sufficient after the both HFJV and AO use; PvO2 was 67.6 and 74.3 torr respectively. Speed of PvCO2 increasing was higher during AO (1.46 torr per min) than during HFJV (0.73 torr per min). Increase of S was bigger during AO than HFJV as well (59 vs 37%). The changes of PvCO2 and S were normalized in 15 min after reconnection to conventional mechanical ventilation. Other fixed parameters were normal and same during the use of both respiratory techniques. The patient involved in the study did not have any neurological or surgical complications in early postoperative period.Both studied respiratory techniques provide sufficient blood oxygenation and can be accompanied with hypercapnia and cerebral hyperemia. These observations evident about the necessity to study the role of hyperoxia, hypercapnia and cerebral hyperemia in patients with underlying cerebral trauma undergoing tracheal resection and reconstruction. The study will help to make a strategy of the foreground use of HFJV and AO in these patients.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Respiratory Tract
