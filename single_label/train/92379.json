{"id":92379,"title":"Association of changes in delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) with changes in cartilage thickness in the medial tibiofemoral compartment of the knee: a 2?year follow-up study using 3.0?T MRI.","abstract":"To determine the association between changes in the delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) index over 2?years as a measure of cartilage proteoglycan concentration, with changes in cartilage thickness in the medial tibiofemoral compartment of knees in middle-aged women.One hundred and forty-eight women (one knee for each subject) aged ?40?years were included. 3.0?T MR images of the knee were acquired at baseline, 1?year and 2?years. Three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) sequences (for cartilage thickness) and 3D inversion recovery-prepared SPGR sequences after dGEMRIC were acquired. Segmentation was performed in the medial central (weight-bearing) femur and tibia to determine cartilage proteoglycan concentration and thickness. The association of change in the dGEMRIC indices between baseline and 1-year follow-up with (a) concomitant changes in cartilage thickness and (b) change in cartilage thickness between 1 and 2?years was assessed using linear regression.In the whole-sample model, a decrease in dGEMRIC indices over time at the central medial femur significantly predicted an increase in cartilage thickness at both the central medial femur (p=0.008) and the medial tibia (p=0.04).A decrease in dGEMRIC indices was associated with an increase in cartilage thickness in the medial compartment. Our results suggest that an increase in cartilage thickness may also be related to a decrease in proteoglycan concentration, which may represent swelling of cartilage in early stages of degeneration.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23873880","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.309485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.254457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Proteoglycan","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteoglycan"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0193016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Echo (phenomenon)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(phenomenon)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Segmentation (image processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Exponentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Spoiled child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiled_child"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Medial compartment of thigh","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_compartment_of_thigh"}]}
