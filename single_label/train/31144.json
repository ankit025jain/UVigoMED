{"id":31144,"title":"Potential neurotoxic effect of ethylene glycol ethers mixtures.","abstract":"Ethylene glycol ethers (EGEs) are widely used as mixtures in various industrial processes and in many household products. 2-Methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol primarily exert gonadotoxic effect, while 2-butoxyethanol and 2-isopropoxyethanol have potent hemolytic activity. EGEs can cross the blood-brain barrier, but their potential neurodegenerative action in vivo has not been investigated, yet. In the present work, we examined potential adverse effects of EGEs on some selected brain structures.A mixture of two compounds: one with stronger hydrophilic properties (2-methoxyethanol or 2-ethoxyethanol) and the second more lipophilic (2-butoxyethanol or 2-isopropoxyethanol) were administered sc for 4 weeks. Total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activity were determined in the frontal cortex and hippocampus.It has been found that 4-week administration of a mixture of two EGEs, with various intensity, decreased total antioxidant capacity, enhanced lipid peroxidation and increased caspase-3 activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of Wistar rat.The obtained results suggested that EGEs exerted adverse effects on the CNS cells and may contribute in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399739","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.89756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Ethylene glycol","weight":0.876779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Lipophilicity","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophilicity"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.82371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Hydrophile","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.76088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Ethylene","weight":0.657565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.653495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Ether","weight":0.592698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.438497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.43534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.412286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.411106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.348035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Neuroanatomy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomy"},{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"2-Methoxyethanol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Methoxyethanol"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Biotechnology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Glycol ethers","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycol_ethers"}]}
