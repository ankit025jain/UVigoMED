{"id":66599,"title":"[Rates of prostate-specific antigen testing for early detection of prostate cancer: a first comparison of German results with current international data].","abstract":"Measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is not only used as a screening instrument by urologists, but also by general practitioners and internal specialists (GP-IS). Until now, there are neither data on the approach of German GP-IS in practicing this nor have data been classified in the context of available international literature on this topic.Between May and December 2012, a questionnaire containing 16 items was sent to 600 GP-IS in Brandenburg and Berlin. The response rate was 65% (392/600). Six indicator questions (IQ1-6) were selected and results were set in the context of available international data. The quality of present studies was evaluated by the Harden criteria.Of the 392 responding physicians, 317 (81%) declared that they would use PSA testing for early detection of PCA (IQ1) and, thus, formed the study group. Of these GP-IS, 38% consider an age between 41 and 50 years as suitable for testing begin (IQ2), while 53% and 14% of the GP-IS perform early detection until the age of 80 and 90 years, respectively (IQ3). A rigid PSA cut-off of 4 ng/ml is considered to be reasonable by 47% of the involved GP-IS, whereas 16% prefer an age-adjusted PSA cut-off (IQ4). Patients with pathological PSA levels were immediately referred to a board-certified urologist by 69% of the GP-IS. On the other hand, 10% first would independently control elevated PSA levels themselves after 3-12 months (IQ5). Furthermore, 14% of the interviewed physicians consider a decrease of PCA-specific mortality by PSA screening as being proven (IQ6). Knowledge regarding PCA diagnostics is mainly based on continuous medical education for GP-IS (33%), personal contact with urologists (6%), and guideline studies (4%). While 53% indicated more than one education source, 4% did not obtain any PCA-specific training. The results provided by this questionnaire evaluating response of German GP-IS to six selected indicator questions fit well into the international context; however, further studies with sufficient methodical quality are required.Despite current findings and controversial recommendations of the two large PCA screening studies on this issue, German GP-IS still frequently use PCA screening by PSA measurement. Primary strategies of early detection as well as follow-up after assessment of pathologically elevated PSA levels poorly follow international recommendations. Thus, an intensification of specific education is justified.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24700162","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Berlin","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.758551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Intelligence quotient","weight":0.694473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.590704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.410603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.376295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Medical education","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Brandenburg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
