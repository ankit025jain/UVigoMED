{"id":36548,"title":"Mediastinal bronchogenic cyst compressing left recurrent laryngeal nerve.","abstract":"A 15-year-old boy developed recurrent laryngeal nerve compression by a bronchogenic cyst, causing recurrent choking. Bronchogenic cyst compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve is unusual. The patient had a normal voice and occasional choking with periods of normalcy in between. A left posterolateral thoracotomy was performed and cyst was excised. Histopathology revealed bronchogenic cyst.
