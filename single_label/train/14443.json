{"id":14443,"title":"Atorvastatin treatment attenuates renal injury in an experimental model of ischemia-reperfusion in rats.","abstract":"Recent studies in animal models have shown that statins can protect against renal failure independent of their lipid-lowering actions, and there is also an association between statin use and improved renal function after suprarenal aortic clamping. We investigated the hypothesis that post-ischemic acute renal failure could be ameliorated with atorvastatin (ATO) treatment and the possible molecular mechanisms in a model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in rats.Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham, IR, and IR?+?ATO. ATO was given by a single intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg) 30 min before reperfusion in the IR?+?ATO group. The IR group and sham group received saline vehicle via the intraperitoneal route.After 24 h of IR, serum creatinine levels were increased in the IR group compared with the sham group (p?<?0.001). ATO treatment reduced the elevation of serum creatinine level by 18% (p?<?0.05) and significantly increased the creatinine clearance rate (p?<?0.001). Concentrations of advanced oxidation protein products and malondialdehyde were reduced in the ATO group, approaching levels observed in sham-group rats. ATO treatment alleviated pathological changes in renal tubular cells. Protein and mRNA levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were reduced significantly.These data suggest that direct protection of injured kidneys by ATO was possible even though the drug was injected 30 min before reperfusion, and that ATO may reduce IR injury by anti-inflammatory effects and by reducing oxidation stress.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Animal
