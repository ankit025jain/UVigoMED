{"id":47110,"title":"Tumor suppressor DLC-1 induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth and invasion of colon cancer cells through the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the biological role and molecular mechanism of the deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1) gene in human colon cancer growth and invasion. Recombinant lentiviral vectors encoding the DLC-1 gene were constructed for transfection into the human colon cancer cell line SW480. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR) and western blot analysis were employed to evaluate the expression of DLC-1, ?-catenin, GSK-3? and c-myc in DLC-1-transfected cells. Moreover, cell proliferation assay, cell colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis analysis and cell migration and invasion assays were performed in order to elucidate the role of DLC-1 in colorectal cancer development and progression. Both real-time qPCR and western blot analyses showed that the DLC-1 gene and protein were overexpressed in the DLC-1-transfected SW480 cells. In addition, the expression of ?-catenin and GSK-3? was upregulated and the expression of the c-myc gene was downregulated in the DLC-1-transfected SW480 cells. Furthermore, DLC-1 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase with subsequent apoptosis. DLC-1 inhibits cell growth and invasion in human colon cancer, functioning as a tumor-suppressor gene, possibly through the regulation of the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System
