{"id":86829,"title":"[Modern immunological and clinical determinants of virus dengue infection].","abstract":"The growing problem of widespread viral infections is a challenge for modern medicine. Emerging reports of dengue virus infections in Europe create a new epidemic problem. The virus responsible for causing the symptoms of the disease is transmitted by mosquitoes. Over 50% of the world's population lives in areas where the risk of dengue feveris high. In total, according to WHO, infected with dengue is 2.4 million people and outbreaks of endemic diseases are present in 100 countries that threaten the 2.5 billion population. There are four serotypes of dengue virus, which belong to the family Flaviviridae and the type of Flavirus. Serotypes are known as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. Contact each of the serotypes of the virus causes long-lasting resistance to the other, and each of them is responsible for the induction of disease epidemics, including severe cases. In the first stage of the disease should seek to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Because of the elevated body temperature is recommended to administer paracetamol formulations and the use of cold compresses. Contraindicated is the use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In severe forms of dengue patients absolutely should be hospitalized and treatment in the intensive care centers. In the treatment of shock, it is recommended that the administration of isotonic crystalloid fluids at 5-10 ml/kg/hr. under the control of hematocrit and fill peripheral microcirculation. The administration of blood products for the large current is required to control bleeding. Dengue vaccine containing DEN-DEN chimeras is still at the stage of preclinical studies.","date":"2014-12-30","categories":"Virus
