{"id":89119,"title":"[Postoperative rehabilitation strategy for acetabular fracture: application of 3D printing technique].","abstract":"To explore the value of 3D printing technique in the surgical management and strategy of rehabilitation therapy of acetabular fracture.For a patient with acetabular fracture, the pelvis model was printed preoperatively by 3D printing technique for surgical simulation to determine the optimal position of the screw, measure the screw length, and design the route of screw entry. Laparoscopic assisted internal fixation was performed, and a gradual and systematic rehabilitation plan was carried out after the surgery based on the results of simulation.The operation was completed successfully with a shortened postoperative recovery time.The application of 3D printing allows more accurate and safer surgical management of acetabular fracture to promote postoperative recovery of the patient and lower the medical costs.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752117","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.728812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Physical medicine and rehabilitation","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Printing","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.27479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"3D printing","weight":0.0822457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Health care prices","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_prices"}]}
