{"id":77111,"title":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like presentation in a HIV-positive patient.","abstract":"There has been several reports of an MND like syndrome in HIV-1 infection, however the data is still sparse. Furthermore, HIV-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) syndrome differs from the classical ALS in some key aspects.. A 44-year-old male presented with a history of insidious onset and gradually progressive asymmetric weakness of lower limbs. He also complained of thinning in both legs, the left leg more than the right since 1 year along with spontaneous twitching of muscles in both the thighs. On neurological examination, the assessment of higher mental functions was normal. There were no cranial nerve deficits. Motor power was grade 5/5 (Medical Research Council scale) in both the upper limbs and 4+ at hips and knees bilaterally, 5 at right ankle, and 4+ at left ankle. All the deep tendon reflexes were brisk with extensor planter responses. There were no cerebellar signs or sensory deficits. HIV-1 was reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Electrophysiological studies were conducted per the MND protocol.None of the nerves studied showed an abnormal drop in compound muscle action potential amplitude with proximal stimulation. There was evidence of diffuse spontaneous activity, which manifests as fibrillation and fasciculation potentials in most muscles tested . Overall there seems to be sufficient evidence to implicate HIV as a potential cause of an ALS-like disorder, but one must also consider the possibility of coincidental HIV infection in patients who have sporadic ALS.","date":"2014-11-11","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842949","annotations":[{"name":"Action
