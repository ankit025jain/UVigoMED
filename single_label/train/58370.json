{"id":58370,"title":"Maternal prepregnancy BMI, offspring's early postnatal growth, and metabolic profile at age 5-6 years: the ABCD Study.","abstract":"Maternal prepregnancy body mass index (pBMI) and offspring's accelerated postnatal growth have adverse consequences for later cardiometabolic health, but it is unknown how these two factors interact.To assess the association between maternal pBMI and offspring's metabolic profile at age 5-6 years and determine the role (independent/mediating/moderating) of offspring's postnatal growth in this association.In total, 1459 mother-child pairs from the prospective ABCD study with known maternal pBMI, offspring postnatal growth (weight and weight-for-length gain) between age 1-3 months (? SD score).We analyzed metabolic components of offspring at age 5-6 years, including waist-to-height-ratio (WHtR), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), fasting glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol values, both individually (Z-scores) and combined (sum Z-scores; metabolic score).Maternal pBMI was positively associated with offspring's WHtR (? = 0.025; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.010-0.039), SBP (? = 0.020; 95% CI, 0.005-0.0035), DBP (? = 0.016; 95% CI, 0.000-0.031), and metabolic score (? = 0.078; 95% CI, 0.039-0.118) after adjusting. Adding postnatal growth had no relevant impact on these effect sizes. Postnatal weight gain was independently associated with WHtR (? = 0.199; 95% CI, 0.097-0.300), fasting glucose values (? = 0.117; 95% CI, 0.008-0.227), metabolic score (? = 0.405; 95% CI, 0.128-0.682). Postnatal weight-for-length gain was independently associated with WHtR (? = 0.145; 95% CI, 0.080-0.211), and metabolic score (? = 0.301; 95% CI, 0.125-0.477). An interaction between maternal pBMI and postnatal weight gain was present in the association with SBP (P = .021) and metabolic score (P = .047), and between maternal pBMI and postnatal weight-for-length gain in the association with triglycerides (P = .022) and metabolic score (P = .042).Both high maternal pBMI and postnatal accelerated growth are associated with adverse metabolic components in early childhood. No evidence was found for a mediating role of postnatal growth. The combination of high maternal pBMI and postnatal accelerated growth amplified individual effects.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy
