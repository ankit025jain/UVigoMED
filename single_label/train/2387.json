{"id":2387,"title":"Interventional radiology: a half century of innovation.","abstract":"The evolution of modern interventional radiology began over half century ago with a simple question. Was it possible to use the same diagnostic imaging tools that had revolutionized the practice of medicine to guide the real-time treatment of disease? This disruptive concept led to rapid treatment advances in every organ system of the body. It became clear that by utilizing imaging some patients could undergo targeted procedures, eliminating the need for major surgery, while others could undergo procedures for previously unsolvable problems. The breadth of these changes now encompasses all of medicine and has forever changed the way we think about disease. In this brief review article, major advances in the field, as chronicled in the pages of Radiology, will be described.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340439","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.716144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.252918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Review article","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_article"},{"name":"Undecidable problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem"},{"name":"Half century","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_century"},{"name":"Organ (music)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"}]}
