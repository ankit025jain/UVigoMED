{"id":85570,"title":"Different efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and prognosis in patients with subtypes of EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Nearly 85 % of lung-cancer-specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitive mutations comprise a substitution at position 858 (21L858R) and deletion mutants in exon 19 (19del). The aim of this study was to assess the role of EGFR mutation subtypes in predicting the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) and the prognosis of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We systematically searched for eligible articles investigating the association between EGFR mutation subtypes and the efficacy of EGFR TKIs and the prognosis of patients with NSCLC. The summary risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) were calculated using meta-analysis. In addition, we used variance analysis for the progression-free survival data (PFS) and used the rank sum test for the overall survival data.We identified 22 eligible trials involving 1,082 patients. The objective response rate of the 19del mutation group was significantly higher than the 21L858R mutation group (RR 1.23; 95 % CI 1.12-1.36; P < 0.0001). The PFS (MD 3.55; 95 % CI 0.90-6.20; P = 0.009; MD 2.57; 95 % CI 0.51-4.62; P = 0.01) and overall survival (OS) (MD 10.52; 95 % CI 5.10-15.93; P = 0.0001) of the 19del mutation group were significantly longer than the 21L858R mutation group; the same results were observed in the variance analysis and rank sum test.The 19del mutation may be a more efficient clinical marker for predicting the response of patients with NSCLC to EGFR TKIs. Furthermore, patients with the 19del mutation have both a longer PFS and OS. The 19del mutation is also the prognostic factor for patients with NSCLC.","date":"2014-10-14","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908327","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.946214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.774736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.763268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.74799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.31402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.289132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.233956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.191855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
