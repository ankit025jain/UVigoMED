{"id":3582,"title":"Preferential expression of OVOL1 in inner root sheath of hair, sebaceous gland, eccrine duct and their neoplasms in human skin.","abstract":"OVOL1 is an important transcription factor for epidermal keratinization, which suppresses proliferation and switches on the differentiation of keratinocytes. A recent genome-wide association study has revealed that OVOL1 is one of the genes associated with susceptibility to atopic dermatitis. Although it is known to be expressed in murine skin and hair follicles, no investigations have focused on its localization in human skin. In the present study, we thus immunolocalized the expression of OVOL1 in normal and diseased human skin. In normal human skin, OVOL1 was preferentially expressed in the suprabasal layer of the epidermis, inner root sheath of hair, mature sebocytes and the ductal portion of the eccrine glands. Compared to this, no remarkable change in the expression of OVOL1 was observed among inflammatory skin diseases. The expression of OVOL1 was evident in eccrine poroma and hidradenoma. Moreover, it was overexpressed in Bowen's disease and sebaceous adenoma, in sharp contrast to its downregulation in their more malignant counterparts, squamous cell carcinoma and sebaceous carcinoma. OVOL1 may play an important role in human skin morphogenesis and tumorigenesis.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509883","annotations":[{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Sebaceous adenoma","weight":0.87695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_adenoma"},{"name":"Sebaceous gland","weight":0.872679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Eccrine sweat gland","weight":0.845478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccrine_sweat_gland"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Sebaceous carcinoma","weight":0.791023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_carcinoma"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.744124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Human skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin"},{"name":"Keratinization","weight":0.726115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinization"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acrospiroma","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrospiroma"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.320203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.249519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.231485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.108675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"}]}
