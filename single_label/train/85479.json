{"id":85479,"title":"Lung resection improves the quality of life of patients with symptomatic bronchiectasis.","abstract":"Bronchiectasis is a significant cause of morbidity. Surgical resection is a treatment option, but its main outcomes regarding quality of life (QOL) and physiologic consequences have not been addressed previously, to our knowledge. We aimed to evaluate the effect of surgical procedures on QOL, exercise capacity, and lung function in patients with bronchiectasis in whom medical treatment was unsuccessful.Patients with noncystic fibrosis in whom medical treatment was unsuccessful and who were candidates for lung resection were enrolled in a prospective study. The main measurements before lung resection and 9 months afterward were QOL according to the Short Form 36 Health Survey and World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaires, lung function test results, and the results of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cycle ergometer.Of 61 patients who were evaluated, 53 (50.9% male, age 41.3 Â± 12.9 years) underwent surgical resection (83% lobectomies), and 44 completed the 9-month follow-up. At baseline, they had low QOL scores, mild obstruction, and diminished exercise capacity. After resection, 2 patients died and adverse events occurred in 24.5%. QOL scores improved remarkably at the 9-month measurements, achieving values considered normal for the general population in most dimensions. Functionally, resection caused mild reduction of lung volume; nevertheless, exercise capacity was not decreased. In fact, 52% of the patients improved their exercise performance. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that low QOL before resection was an important predictor of QOL improvement after resection (p = 0.0001).Lung resection promotes a significant improvement in the QOL of patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis without compromising their exercise capacity.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928672","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Lung function test","weight":0.712948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_function_test"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.64481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Bronchiectasis","weight":0.578148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiectasis"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.440918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.297581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.220839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.193664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Lung volumes","weight":0.0621105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_volumes"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
