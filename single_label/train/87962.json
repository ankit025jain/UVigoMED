{"id":87962,"title":"Problems of the glenohumeral joint in overhead sports - literature review. Part II - pathology and pathophysiology.","abstract":"In throwing sports shoulder is exposed to enormous and often repetitive overloads. Some sports (contact sports) are also connected with direct trauma. We are thus dealing with traumatic injuries, overload and degenerative damage. The article discusses the most frequent injuries of the shoulder characteristic for throwing sports. These are mainly disorders of arm rotation, internal impingement, lesion of the labrum (SLAP) and rotator cuff tears (PASTA).","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941456","annotations":[{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.722756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.67052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Glenoid labrum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_labrum"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Operator overloading","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Strength training","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Contact sport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_sport"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
