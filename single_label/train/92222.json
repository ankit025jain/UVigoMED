{"id":92222,"title":"Clinical study of the visual field defects caused by occipital lobe lesions.","abstract":"The central visual field is projected to the region from the occipital tip to the posterior portion of the medial area in the striate cortex. However, central visual field disturbances have not been compared with the location of the lesions in the striate cortex.Thirteen patients with visual field defects caused by partial involvement of the striate cortex were enrolled. The lesions were classified according to their location into the anterior portion, the posterior portion of the medial area, and the occipital tip. Visual field defects were examined by the Goldmann perimetry, the Humphrey perimetry and the auto-plot tangent screen. We defined a defect within the central 10Â° of vision as a central visual field disturbance. The visual field defects in 13 patients were compared with the location of their lesions in the striate cortex.The medial area was involved in 7 patients with no involvement of the occipital tip. In 2 of them, peripheral homonymous hemianopia without central visual field disturbance was shown, and their lesions were located only in the anterior portion. One patient with a lesion in the posterior portion alone showed incomplete central homonymous hemianopia. Three of 4 patients with lesions located in both the anterior and posterior portions of the medial area showed incomplete central homonymous hemianopia and peripheral homonymous hemianopia. The occipital tip was involved in 6 patients. Five of them had small lesions in the occipital tip alone and showed complete central homonymous hemianopia or quadrantanopia. The other patient with a lesion in the lateral posterior portion and bilateral occipital tip lesions showed bilateral slight peripheral visual field disturbance in addition to complete central homonymous hemianopia on both sides.Lesions in the posterior portion of the medial area as well as the occipital tip caused central visual field disturbance in our study, as indicated in previous reports. Central homonymous hemianopia tended to be incomplete in patients with lesions in the posterior portion in the medial area. In contrast, complete central homonymous hemianopia and quadrantanopia were shown in patients with occipital tip lesions. Our study suggested that the fibers related to the central visual field were sparse in the posterior portion of the medial area in contrast to the occipital tip, and approached the occipital tip with a high concentration of fibers.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435066","annotations":[{"name":"Occipital lobe","weight":0.852481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.788923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Visual cortex","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex"},{"name":"Homonymous hemianopsia","weight":0.744256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonymous_hemianopsia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.73612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.732371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.691951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.566663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.524068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.520363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Anterior pituitary","weight":0.270908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_pituitary"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Perimetry","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetry"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Peripheral vision","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vision"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hemianopsia","weight":0.0222665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemianopsia"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Sparse matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Striation (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striation_(geology)"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Tangent","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent"},{"name":"Quadrantanopia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantanopia"},{"name":"Goldmann (publisher)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldmann_(publisher)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
