{"id":56024,"title":"Hyphema is a risk factor for failure of trabeculectomy in neovascular glaucoma: a retrospective analysis.","abstract":"Several retinal ischemic diseases can cause neovascular glaucoma (NVG). Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC) is a relatively better treatment modality in the management of eyes with NVG than other glaucoma surgeries. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that may influence the outcome of trabeculectomy with MMC for NVG.Forty-nine NVG eyes from 43 patients (26 males and 17 females) underwent primary trabeculectomy with MMC. The mean follow-up period was 16.8 ± 8.1 months (range, 6 to 34 months). Twenty-one eyes of 21 patients received intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) 3.6 ± 1.8 days before trabeculectomy with MMC. A Kaplan-Meier survival-curve analysis was used to summarize the cumulative probability of success. We examined the relationship between the surgical outcome and the following surgical factors: gender, age, history of panretinal photocoagulation, history of cataract surgery, history of vitrectomy, preoperative IVB, NVG in the fellow eye, and postoperative complications (hyphema, choroidal detachment, and formation of fibrin) by multivariate analysis.The survival rate was 83.7% after 6 months, 70.9% after 12 months, and 60.8% after 24 months. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no significant difference in the survival rate between the eyes with preoperative IVB (n = 21) and the eyes without preoperative IVB (n = 28) (p = 0.14). The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that postoperative hyphema (odds ratio, 6.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 35.97) was significantly associated with the surgical outcome (p = 0.02).Postoperative hyphema was significantly correlated with the outcome of trabeculectomy for NVG. There was no significant association between preoperative IVB and postoperative hyphema or the results of trabeculectomy.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Eye
