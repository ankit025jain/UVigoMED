{"id":79077,"title":"Three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging findings in a patient with relapsing polychondritis.","abstract":"We report three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging findings in a patient with relapsing polychondritis.Case report.A 76-year-old woman initially presented with bilateral auricular swelling together with dyspnoea. Three months later, she experienced left hearing loss and recurrent vertigo. A biopsy of the auricle was performed and relapsing polychondritis was diagnosed. The patient underwent three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging 4 hours after intravenous injection of a standard dose of gadolinium. Gadolinium enhancement was visible throughout the vestibule and the endolymphatic space could not be visualised, suggesting breakdown of the blood-labyrinth barrier.This is the first radiological report to demonstrate breakdown of the blood-labyrinth barrier in a case of relapsing polychondritis with inner ear impairment.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495479","annotations":[{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.842092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Inner ear","weight":0.670202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.578186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.455117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.387715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.237159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.188249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Relapsing polychondritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapsing_polychondritis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Endolymph","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endolymph"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Vestibule (architecture)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibule_(architecture)"}]}
