{"id":21055,"title":"Usefulness of adding SPECT/CT to 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO)-labeled leukocyte imaging for diagnosing prosthetic joint infections.","abstract":"This study evaluated the usefulness of adding single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) (SPECT/CT) to technetium Tc 99m (Tc) hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO)-labeled leukocyte imaging for diagnosing infections in hip or knee joint prostheses.The Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scans of 164 patients (71 with hip prostheses and 93 with knee prostheses) with clinically suspected prosthetic infections were reviewed retrospectively. Planar images were taken 4 to 6 and 21 to 26 hours after injecting the labeled leukocytes and SPECT/CT images were obtained 4 to 6 hours after the injection. The final diagnosis of infection was based on pathologic findings (n = 70), bacteriological data (n = 61), or clinical follow-up (n = 33).Of the 164 patients, 89 patients had a diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy of the planar images alone were 82.0%, 88.0%, 89.0%, 80.5%, and 84.8%, respectively. When the planar images were combined with SPECT, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy were 91.0%, 88.0%, 90.0%, 89.2%, and 89.6%, respectively. When the planar images were combined with SPECT/CT, these values increased further to 93.3%, 93.3%, 94.3%, 92.1%, and 93.3%, respectively. Adding CT to SPECT resulted in a greater increase in sensitivity and specificity for hip prosthesis infections than for knee prosthesis infections. SPECT/CT mainly contributed by precisely localizing the anatomical site of the active inflammatory lesion and by delineating the extent of the lesion after diagnosis with SPECT.Single-photon emission computed tomography/CT combined with Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocyte imaging was useful for diagnosing prosthesis infections, particularly in hip prosthesis infections, as it improved diagnostic accuracy and provided anatomical localization data.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625603","annotations":[{"name":"Single-photon emission computed tomography","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.750827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.72031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.713303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.456219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.344648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0334287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Net present value","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"}]}
