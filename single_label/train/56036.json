{"id":56036,"title":"Quantitative analysis of iris changes after physiologic and pharmacologic mydriasis in a rural Chinese population.","abstract":"To estimate and compare the change in iris cross-sectional area (IA) and iris volume (IV) following physiologic and pharmacologic pupil dilation in primary angle closure suspects (PACS) and normal subjects.Anterior segment-optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) measurements in light, dark, and following pharmacologic dilation were obtained on 186 PACS and 224 normal subjects examined during the 5-year follow-up of the Handan Eye Study. Iris cross-sectional area, IV, and other biometric parameters calculated using the Zhongshan angle assessment program in the right eyes of all subjects were analyzed.The mean IA and IV decreased in dark compared with light and after pharmacologic dilation in both PACS and normal eyes. This change was statistically significant in normal eyes: light versus pharmacologic dilation for IA (P = 0.038) and for IV, both light versus dark (P = 0.031) and light versus pharmacologic dilation (P = 0.012). A longer axial length (P = 0.028) and a greater change in pupil diameter (PD) (P < 0.001) were associated with a larger decrease of IA for the light to dark comparison. A diagnosis of normal eyes (P = 0.011), larger PD in dark (P = 0.001), and a larger change in PD (P = 0.001) were associated with a larger decrease of IV from light to dark.The differences in iris behavior between PACS and normal rural Chinese subjects following physiologic or pharmacologic pupillary dilation may help provide insights into the pathogenesis of angle closure.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764064","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.672634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Mydriasis","weight":0.5162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mydriasis"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.426121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.401674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.28735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.279812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Pupillary response","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillary_response"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Zhongshan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Handan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handan"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/224"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Military history of China before 1911","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_China_before_1911"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Picture archiving and communication system","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system"}]}
