{"id":9942,"title":"The effects of bioactive compounds from plant foods on mitochondrial function: a focus on apoptotic mechanisms.","abstract":"Mitochondria are essential organelles for cellular integrity and functionality maintenance and their imparement is implicated in the development of a wide range of diseases, including metabolic, cardiovascular, degenerative and hyperproliferative pathologies. The identification of different compounds able to interact with mitochondria for therapeutic purposes is currently becoming of primary importance. Indeed, it is well known that foods, particularly those of vegetable origin, present several constituents with beneficial effects on health. This review summarizes and updates the most recent findings concerning the mechanisms through which different dietary compounds from plant foods affect mitochondria functionality in healthy and pathological in vitro and in vivo models, paying particular attention to the pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and apoptosis.
