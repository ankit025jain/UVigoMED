{"id":18191,"title":"Brodie's abscess of the posterior ilium: a rare cause for low back pain in children.","abstract":"Brodie's abscess of the pelvis is very rare in healthy children. It can be missed because of its varied presentation. We present an 11-year-old boy who presented with low back pain. Investigations revealed a well-defined lesion in the posterior ilium. He underwent open biopsy and debridement. At the end of the final follow-up, he was asymptomatic and there was no recurrence. We present this case for the rare site of Brodie's abscess and for its unusual presentation as low back pain.
