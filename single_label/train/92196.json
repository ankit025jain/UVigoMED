{"id":92196,"title":"Buccal fat pad lifting: an alternative open technique for malar augmentation.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to introduce a novel technique for malar augmentation using buccal fat pad pedicle flaps and to evaluate the long-term results and complications of the technique.The investigators designed and conducted a prospective clinical trial. Patients underwent unilateral malar augmentation surgery using buccal fat pad pedicle flaps from June 2011 through June 2012. Patients underwent surgery for esthetic reasons or for trauma with severely comminuted or old zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures that could not be reduced precisely. The primary predictor variable was the buccal fat pad pedicle flap technique. The primary outcome variables included the amount of augmentation and resorption (which was estimated by comparing pre- with postsurgical photographic views), pain, edema, bruising, and nerve and parotid duct injuries.Thirteen patients (8 men and 5 women) underwent malar augmentation in the cheekbone area using the buccal fat pad pedicle flap technique. One year after surgery, the average amount of resorption was 0.376 mm. Other major complications, such as prolonged bruising, massive hematoma, intense pain, asymmetry, and parotid duct injury, were not observed.These results indicate that this new open-access technique should be considered an alternative method for the management of mild to moderate malar depression in patients undergoing esthetic and post-trauma surgery.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438602","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.863003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.810769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.707852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.665931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.555951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.425721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.218717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.2065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Parotid duct","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_duct"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariate"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Zygomatic bone","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomatic_bone"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
