{"id":92076,"title":"[Recombinant thrombopoietin antiradiation therapeutic effectiveness evaluation on dogs according to hemopoiesis and survival criteria].","abstract":"Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rh TPO) has been investigated as a means of acute radiation disease urgent treatment in the experiments on 24 mongrel dogs. The animals were exposed to total acute gamma-irradiation at the doses of 3.5 Gy (exceeding LD50/45 under our conditions) and 3 Gy. All the dogs including control ones received antibiotics Ampicillin and Gentamicin twice a day during the acute period from the 7th to the 21st day. TPO was injected one time s/c or i/v at the doses of5 or 10 mkg/kg 1.5-2 h after exposure. TPO at a dose of 5 mkg/kg was ineffective. TPO at a dose of 10 mkg/kg had a positive effect on the kinetics of blood forming units, especially platelets (nadir, restoration rate) in terms of the 45-day survival. As a result, in TPO groups, nadir averaged at both exposure doses on leucocytes (1.3-1.4) x 10(9)/l vs (0.70-0.75) x 10(9)/l in control groups and on thrombocytes (102-112) x 10(9)/l vs (44-33) x 10(9)/l in control ones. Despite the low number of animals in experimental groups, the results permit to regard rhTPO as a worth-while urgent therapeutic means for the acute radiation damage treatment and preventing thrombopenia.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450209","annotations":[{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.704677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.69103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.475452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.450122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.414333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thrombopoietin","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoietin"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Ampicillin","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.128276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"List of Latin digraphs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_digraphs"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"}]}
