{"id":55498,"title":"Polymorphisms of DNA repair genes OGG1 and XPD and the risk of age-related cataract in Egyptians.","abstract":"To analyze the association of the polymorphisms of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D (XPD) and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase-1 (OGG1) genes with the risk of age-related cataract (ARC) in an Egyptian population.This case-control study included 150 patients with ARC and 50 controls. Genotyping of XPD Asp³¹²Asn was performed by amplification refractory mutation system PCR assay and genotyping of OGG1 Ser³²?Cys was carried out by PCR including confronting two-pair primers.The Asn/Asn genotype of XPD gene was significantly associated with increased risk of ARC (odds ratio [OR] = 2.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-7.43, p = 0.04) and cortical cataract (OR = 5.06, 95% CI = 1.70-15.05, p = 0.002). The Asn³¹² allele was significantly associated with an increased risk of ARC (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.06-2.89, p = 0.03) and cortical cataract (OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.56-5.08, p<0.001). The OGG1 Cys/Cys genotype frequency was significantly higher in ARC (OR = 4.13, 95% CI = 0.93-18.21, p = 0.04) and the Cys(³²? allele (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.07-3.20, p = 0.03). Moreover, the Cys/Cys genotype of the OGG1 gene was significantly higher in cortical cataract (OR = 6.00, 95% CI = 1.24-28.99, p = 0.01) and the Cys³²? allele was also significantly associated with cortical cataract (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.30-4.63, p = 0.005).The results suggest that the Asn/Asn genotype and Asn³¹² allele of XPD polymorphism, as well as the Cys/Cys genotype and Cys³²? allele of the OGG1 polymorphism, may be associated with increased risk of the development of ARC, particularly the cortical type, in the Egyptian population.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868140","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.829553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Xeroderma pigmentosum","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeroderma_pigmentosum"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"DNA glycosylase","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_glycosylase"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.752786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.729085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Asparagine","weight":0.707573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine"},{"name":"Complementation (genetics)","weight":0.679991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.302191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.119848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Genotype frequency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype_frequency"},{"name":"Oxoguanine glycosylase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxoguanine_glycosylase"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ancient Egypt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Egyptians","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians"}]}
