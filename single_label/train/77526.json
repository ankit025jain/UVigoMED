{"id":77526,"title":"[Evaluation of work-related stress in call-center workers: application of a methodology].","abstract":"Several studies highlighting a correlation between call-center working conditions and psychosocial and ergonomic hazards.The aim of this study is to provide an operating methodology for the risk assessment of work-related stress. The study involved 554 call-centre workers employed in three insurance organizations and a mixed work group (worker, company and public health representative) for the study management was defined. We experimented an objective self-made checklist and then we administered a modified version of the OSI (Occupational Stress Indicator) questionnaire. We obtained complementary information from the two different data collection methods.The findings highlight a low level of perceived stress and health complaints compared with other studies previously carried out mainly in 'outsourcing' call centres: workers don't show stress symptoms without adopting coping strategies. Moreover the study underlines an acceptable level of work satisfaction, although there are low career opportunities. These results are probable due to the low job seniority associated to the high job security--the large majority of respondents, 87%, consisted of permanent workers--and the working time mainly consisted of daily shifts five days a week. Our methodology seems to be able to detect the level of work-related stress with a good degree of coherence. Furthermore the presence of a mixed work group determined a good level of involvement among the workers: 464 out of 554 operators completed and returned the questionnaire, representing a response rate of about 84%.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665626","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.714127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.701987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.667574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.598597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.514156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.512248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.471989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Call centre","weight":0.435634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.355971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Outsourcing","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.186966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Degree of coherence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_coherence"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Working time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time"},{"name":"Checklist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Operator (profession)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(profession)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Seniority","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seniority"}]}
