{"id":11691,"title":"Synchronous alteration pattern between serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein and Smad7 in pilocarpine-induced rats of epilepsy.","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) signaling participates in the epileptogenesis. Serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP) and Smad7 synergize in the inhibition of the TGF? signaling. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression pattern of STRAP and Smad7 in the hippocampus and temporal lobe cortex of pilocarpine-induced rats models of epilepsy.Lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced rats with status epilepticus (SE) were established. Total of 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats was used as control (n?=?10), 24 h (n?=?10), 72 h (n?=?10), 1 week (n?=?10), 1 month (n?=?10), and 2 months (n?=?10) after pilocarpine-induced SE, respectively. We detected the expression levels of STRAP and Smad7 in the hippocampus and temporal lobe cortex of rats at the aforementioned time points using western blotting and immunohistochemistry.STRAP level was significantly decreased in 24 h, 72 h (acute stage), 1 week (latent stage), 1 month, 2 months (chronic stage), respectively, in the rat models compared with the control rats by using both western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Smad7 had similar reduced pattern as STRAP.Our results indicate that STRAP and Smad7 proteins might be involved in the development of temporal lobe epilepsy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577865","annotations":[{"name":"Status epilepticus","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_epilepticus"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Temporal lobe epilepsy","weight":0.824545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe_epilepsy"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.756289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.634476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Epileptogenesis","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptogenesis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.35351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.340152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.207822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.167499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Strap","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strap"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"SMAD (protein)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMAD_(protein)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Lithium (medication)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)"}]}
