{"id":29351,"title":"Prevalence and characteristics of e-cigarette users in Great Britain: Findings from a general population survey of smokers.","abstract":"E-cigarettes may be effective smoking cessation aids and their use by smokers has been growing rapidly. It is important to observe and assess natural patterns in the use of e-cigarettes whilst experimental data accumulates. This paper reports the prevalence of e-cigarette awareness, beliefs and usage, including brand choice, and characterises the socio-demographic and smoking profile associated with current use, among the general population of smokers and recent ex-smokers.Data were obtained from 3538 current and 579 recent ex-smokers in a cross-sectional online survey of a national sample of smokers in Great Britain in November and December 2012. Differences between current and recent ex-smokers in the prevalence of e-cigarette awareness, beliefs and usage were examined and the socio-demographic and smoking profile associated with current use of e-cigarettes was assessed in a series of simple and multiple logistic regressions.Ninety-three percent of current and recent ex-smokers (n=3841) were aware of e-cigarettes. Approximately a fifth (n=884) were currently using e-cigarettes, whilst just over a third (n=1507) had ever used them. Sixty-seven percent of the sample (n=2758) believed e-cigarettes to be less harmful than cigarettes; however, almost a quarter (n=994) remained unsure. Among both current and recent ex-smokers, the most popular reasons for using were health, cutting down and quitting (each >80%) and 38% used the brand 'E-lites'. Among current smokers who were aware of but had never used e-cigarettes, approximately half (n=1040) were interested in using them in the future. Among current smokers, their use was associated with higher socio-economic status (OR=1.48, 95%CI=1.25-1.75), smoking more cigarettes (OR=1.02, 95%CI=1.01-1.03) and having a past-year quit attempt (OR=2.82, 95%CI=2.38-3.34).There is a near universal awareness of e-cigarettes and their use appears to be common among smokers in Great Britain although a quarter of all smokers are unsure as to whether e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes. E-lites - a brand that delivers a low dose of nicotine - is the most popular. E-cigarette users appear to have higher socio-economic status, to smoke more cigarettes per day and to have attempted to quit in the past year.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679611","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.756375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.703857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.590129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.518093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Great Britain","weight":0.499795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.486215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.288693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Brand","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"},{"name":"1040","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1040"},{"name":"884","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/884"},{"name":"1507","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1507"},{"name":"994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/994"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Voting age","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_age"},{"name":"Paid survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_survey"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Universe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Covenant (Halo)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(Halo)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Experimental data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_data"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
