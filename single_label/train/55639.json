{"id":55639,"title":"Comparison of different surgery procedures for convergence insufficiency-type intermittent exotropia in children.","abstract":"To compare prospectively the surgical outcomes of different surgery procedures for convergence insufficiency (CI)-type intermittent exotropia (IXT) in children.Forty-five children with CI-type IXT were included in this prospective surgical study with 6 months follow-up. According to the different surgical procedures, all children were randomly divided into three groups: the unilateral medial rectus resection (UMR) group (15 cases), the bilateral medial rectus resections (BMR) group (14 cases) and the improved unilateral recession-resection (R&R) group (16 cases). In the UMR and BMR groups, the medial rectus resection(s) were based on the distance exodeviation. In the R&R group, UMR was based on the near exodeviation while lateral rectus recession was based on the distance exodeviation. A successful surgical alignment was defined as the distant deviation in the primary gaze to be between ? 10 prism dioptres (PD) of exophoria/tropia and ? 5 PD of esophoria/tropia. The success rate, the preoperative and postoperative deviations at distance and near and near-distance differences among groups were compared.At the last follow-up of 6 months, the success rate in the R&R (87.5%) group was significantly higher than those in the UMR (13.3%) and BMR (42.9%) groups (p=0.000 and 0.008); the mean exodeviations at distance and near in the R&R group were significantly different from those in the UMR and BMR groups (p=0.000 and 0.001); there were no significant differences in the mean near-distance differences between the R&R group and the other two groups (p>0.05).The improved R&R procedure in which medial rectus resection based on the near deviation with lateral rectus recession based on the distant deviation has a better alignment than the UMR and BMR surgeries for the treatment of children with CI-type IXT. All the UMR, BMR and improved R&R surgery can reduce near-distance differences in children with CI-type IXT.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842862","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.545913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medial rectus muscle","weight":0.296809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"},{"name":"Chalcogen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcogen"},{"name":"Carbon group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"},{"name":"Prism (optics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics)"},{"name":"Lateral rectus muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Exotropia","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotropia"},{"name":"Convergence insufficiency","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_insufficiency"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Convergence (eye)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(eye)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Gaze","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze"},{"name":"Nitrogen group","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_group"}]}
