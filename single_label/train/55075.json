{"id":55075,"title":"UV cross-linking of donor corneas confers resistance to keratolysis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to develop a modified ex vivo corneal cross-linking method that increases stromal resistance to enzymatic degradation for use as a carrier for the Boston keratoprosthesis.Ex vivo cross-linking of human corneas was performed using Barron artificial anterior chambers. The corneas were deepithelialized, pretreated with riboflavin solution (0.1% riboflavin/20% dextran), and irradiated with ultraviolet A (UV-A) light (? = 370 nm, irradiance = 3 mW/cm) for various durations. The combined effect of UV-A and gamma (?) irradiation was also assessed using the commercially available ?-irradiated corneal donors. The corneas were then trephined and incubated at 37°C with 0.3% collagenase A solution. The time to dissolution of each cornea was compared across treatments.Deepithelialized corneas (no UV light, no riboflavin) dissolved in 5.8 ± 0.6 hours. Cross-linked corneas demonstrated increased resistance to dissolution, with a time to dissolution of 17.8 ± 2.6 hours (P < 0.0001). The corneal tissues' resistance to collagenase increased with longer UV-A exposure, reaching a plateau at 30 minutes. Cross-linking both the anterior and posterior corneas did not provide added resistance when compared with cross-linking the anterior corneas only (P > 0.05). ?-irradiated corneas dissolved as readily as deepithelialized controls regardless of whether they were further cross-linked (5.6 ± 1.2 hours) or not (6.1 ± 0.6 hours) (P = 0.43).Collagen cross-linking of the deepithelialized anterior corneal surface for 30 minutes conferred optimal resistance to in vitro keratolysis by collagenase A.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25014151","annotations":[{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.877721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.843373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.624962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Collagenase","weight":0.498533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagenase"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.466442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.394385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Boston","weight":0.167032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0725953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Dextran","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextran"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
