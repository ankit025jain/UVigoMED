{"id":52394,"title":"Comparison of glycaemic response to honey and glucose in type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"To compare the glycaemic effect of 75 gram and 30 gram of natural honey in a honey tolerance test with that of 75 gram glucose in type 2 diabetics.The experimental study was conducted at the Jinnah Medical College Hospital, Karachi, and comprised 97 type 2 diabetic patients who came to the out-patient department between March and August 2011. The patients were randomly divided into 75 gram honey group (group 1), 30 gram honey group (group 2), and 75 gram glucose group (group 3). Fasting blood samples were obtained as well as after 1 and 2 hour. SPSS 11 was used for statistical analysis.Of the 97 participants, 62 (64%) were females and 35 (36%) males.Their ages ranged from 25-68 years. Mean rise in blood glucose after two hours in group 2 was 30 mg/dl; group 1, 85mg/dl, and group 3, 170 mg/dl. The difference was statistically significant (p <0.005).The glucose response was significantly lower at 2 hours in group 2 (p <0.001) compared to group 1 or group 2. A significant difference was also seen in group 1 and 3 (p <0.0001). The plasma glucose level in response to honey peaked at 60 min and showed a rapid decline compared to that of glucose, indicating a lower glycaemic response of honey. A small proportion of patients 3 (10.7%) even showed a glucose lowering effect after low dose of honey.Low dose of honey can be a valuable sugar substitute for patients with diabetes.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605717","annotations":[{"name":"Sugar substitute","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_substitute"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.801236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.72,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.607853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Honey","weight":0.580975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.125146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Karachi","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali Jinnah","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"}]}
