{"id":56223,"title":"A new index to monitor central visual field progression in glaucoma.","abstract":"The visual field index (VFI) summarizes global visual field (VF) data and was developed to monitor glaucoma progression using 24-2 and 30-2 strategies. We applied similar principles and statistical procedures to develop a new parameter, the central field index (CFI), to monitor 10-2 VF progression.Retrospective cohort.Glaucoma patients with paracentral defects seen on 24-2 perimetry and followed up with at least 5 10-2 VF tests.The CFI was developed by calculating age-corrected defect depth at test points obtained during 10-2 examinations. The sensitivities at these points were scored as percentages similar to the method described for the VFI: 100-[(|total deviation|/age-corrected normal threshold) Ã— 100]. A weighting procedure was applied based on published estimates of the occipital cortical spatial magnification. For validation, we performed mixed linear model testing for the association between CFI rates of change (%/year) and known risk factors for glaucoma progression in a population with established glaucoma and at least 5 10-2 VF tests. To determine whether the CFI was affected by cataract, as is known to occur with mean deviation (MD), we conducted a pilot evaluation comparing rates of CFI change in 3 groups: (1) eyes with cataract, (2) pseudophakic eyes, and (3) eyes in which cataract surgery was performed in the middle of the series.Rates of CFI and MD change.Central field index values were calculated for 176 eyes of 142 patients. The mean rate of CFI change of the entire sample was -1.10%/year (95% confidence interval, -1.03 to -1.16%/year). Elevated intraocular pressure (P<0.001) was associated significantly with faster CFI change, whereas lens status did not influence CFI rates of change (P>0.100) CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a new index to monitor central field progression that is minimally affected by the presence or removal of cataract and that correlates significantly with an important risk factor for glaucoma progression. This new index may become useful for glaucoma management, especially when combined with conventional static perimetry strategies.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Eye
