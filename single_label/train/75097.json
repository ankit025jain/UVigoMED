{"id":75097,"title":"Apolipoprotein E genotype and the diagnostic accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer disease.","abstract":"Several studies suggest that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ?4 allele modulates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of ?-amyloid 42 (A?42). Whether this effect is secondary to the association of the APOE ?4 allele with cortical A? deposition or whether APOE ?4 directly influences CSF levels of A?42 independently of A? pathology remains unknown.To evaluate whether the APOE genotype affects the diagnostic accuracy of CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD), in particular A?42 levels, and whether the association of APOE ?4 with CSF biomarkers depends on cortical A? status.We collected data from 4 different centers in Sweden, Finland, and Germany. Cohort A consisted of 1345 individuals aged 23 to 99 years with baseline CSF samples, including 309 with AD, 287 with prodromal AD, 399 with stable mild cognitive impairment, 99 with dementias other than AD, and 251 controls. Cohort B included 105 nondemented younger individuals (aged 20-34 years) with CSF samples available. Cohort C included 118 patients aged 60 to 80 years with mild cognitive symptoms who underwent flutemetamol F 18 ([18F]flumetamol) positron emission tomography amyloid imaging and CSF tap.Standard care.Cerebrospinal fluid levels of A?42 and total and phosphorylated tau in relation to the APOE ?2/?3/?4 polymorphism in different diagnostic groups and in cases with or without cortical uptake of [18F]flutemetamol.The CSF levels of A?42 but not total and phosphorylated tau were lower in APOE ?4 carriers compared with noncarriers irrespective of diagnostic group (cohort A). Despite this, CSF levels of A?42 differed between participants with AD when compared with controls and those with stable mild cognitive impairment, even when stratifying for APOE genotype (P?<?.001 to P?=?.006). Multiple binary logistic regression revealed that CSF levels of A?42 and APOE ?4 genotype were independent predictors of AD diagnosis. In cohort B, APOE ?4 carrier status did not influence CSF levels of A?42. Moreover, when stratifying for cortical uptake of [18F]flutemetamol in cohort C, APOE ?4 genotype did not influence CSF levels of A?42. This result was replicated in a cohort with individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B scanning.Cerebrospinal fluid levels of A?42 are strongly associated with the diagnosis of AD and cortical A? accumulation independent of APOE genotype. The clinical cutoff for CSF levels of A?42 should be the same for all APOE genotypes.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Nervous System
