{"id":55592,"title":"Apparent progression of presbyopia after laser in situ keratomileusis in patients with early presbyopia.","abstract":"To assess the effect of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) on near visual function in presbyopic patients.Retrospective cohort study.Fifty-three eyes of 40 patients 45 years of age and older who had undergone LASIK for high myopia (-6 diopters [D] and over) were included. The minimal add powers for obtaining the best-corrected near visual acuity (add powers) were measured preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively, and the correlations with the powers corrected by LASIK, corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs), ocular HOAs, and patient ages were evaluated using univariate analysis. Factors correlated with the changes in add powers were evaluated further by multivariate analysis.The mean ± standard deviation patient age was 50.0 ± 4.1 years; the power corrected by LASIK was -7.56 ± 1.06 D. The mean add power was 1.80 ± 0.60 D preoperatively, which increased significantly (P < .001) to 2.18 ± 0.69 D postoperatively. Significant correlations with the increased add powers were detected with age (P = .01) and the power corrected by LASIK (P = .04) but not with corneal and ocular HOAs (P > .05). Multivariate analysis showed that only age was correlated significantly (P = .01). The percentage of eyes with increased add powers of 0.5 D or more was 60.4%, which was significantly (P = .02) higher in younger patients.This study verified the apparent progression of presbyopia after LASIK and the importance of obtaining informed consent from patients, especially those with early presbyopia.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853261","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.733822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.648787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Presbyopia","weight":0.144746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyopia"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.127918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.110498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.0546422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"}]}
