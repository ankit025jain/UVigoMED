{"id":89313,"title":"Dermal skin substitutes for upper limb reconstruction: current status, indications, and contraindications.","abstract":"Dermal skin substitutes are a group of biologically engineered materials composed of collagen and glycosaminoglycans and are devoid of cellular structures. These biodegradable materials act as an artificial dermis to promote neovascularization and neodermis formation. Their applications in soft tissue reconstructions are rapidly expanding. In this article, the indications, advantages, and limitations of dermal skin substitutes for reconstruction of soft tissue defects of the upper extremity are reviewed.
