{"id":45507,"title":"Cholecystitis.","abstract":"Acute cholecystitis is defined as inflammation of the gallbladder and is usually caused by obstruction of the cystic duct. Cholescintigraphy is the most sensitive imaging modality for cholecystitis. The gold standard treatment of acute cholecystitis is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Operating early in the disease course decreases overall hospital stay and avoids increased complications, conversion to open procedures, and mortality. Cholecystitis during pregnancy is a challenging problem for surgeons. Operative intervention is generally safe for both mother and fetus, given the improved morbidity of the laparoscopic approach compared with open, although increased caution should be exercised in women with gallstone pancreatitis.
