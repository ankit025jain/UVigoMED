{"id":91685,"title":"Intraoperative phosphorus-32 brachytherapy plaque for multiply recurrent high-risk epidural neuroblastoma.","abstract":"Achieving local control is a crucial component in the management of neuroblastoma, but this may be complicated in the setting of prior radiation treatment, especially when the therapeutic target is in proximity to critical structures such as the spinal cord. The authors describe a pediatric patient with multiply recurrent neuroblastoma and prior high-dose radiation therapy to the spine who presented with progressive epidural disease. The patient was managed with resection and intraoperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy using a phosphorus-32 ((32)P) plaque previously developed for the treatment of brain and spine lesions.
