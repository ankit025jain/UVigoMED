{"id":37610,"title":"[Research on the correlation between Chinese medical syndrome types and objective indices of Wilson's disease].","abstract":"To explore the correlation between Chinese medical syndrome types of Wilson's disease (WD) and clinical materials as well as physical and chemical indices.Totally 116 WD patients were typed by Chinese medical syndrome. The correlation between Chinese medical syndrome types and clinical materials as well as physical and chemical indices were analyzed using binary stepwise Logistic regression by SPSS 19.0 Software, taking the common Chinese medical syndrome types as the dependent variable and clinical materials as well as physical and chemical indices as the independent variables.Gan-Galibladder dampness-heat syndrome (GGDHS, 35.3%). Gan-stagnation and Pi-deficiency syndrome (GSPDS, 13.8%), Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (GSYDS, 13.8%), and phlegm-dampness retention syndrome (PDRS, 12.1%) were most often seen. GGDHS was positively correlated with grade of K-F ring, total bilirubin (TBIL), alanine transaminase (ALT), laminin (LN) (P < 0.01). GSYDS was positively correlated with TBIL (P < 0.01). PDRS was positively correlated with clinical types, ceruloplasmin (CP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total protein (TP) (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Qi blood deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with disease course, blood ammonia, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and LN (P < 0.01, P < 0.05).Chinese medical syndrome types were correlated with clinical materials, physical and chemical indices in WD patients, which could provide experimental reference for Chinese medical syndrome typing. GGDHS, GSPDS, GSYDS, and PDRS were most often seen.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483109","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.910859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Ammonia","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Blood urea nitrogen","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_urea_nitrogen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.787757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.744023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.697888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.624363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Wilson's disease","weight":0.442693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.40621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.352928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.164836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0470393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Laminin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminin"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
