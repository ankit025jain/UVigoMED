{"id":91582,"title":"Diagnostic imaging in carotid artery dissection: a case report and review of current modalities.","abstract":"This case report presents the challenges associated with the existing screening modalities in the diagnosis of carotid artery dissection, and also reviews the diagnostic efficiency, limitations, and recent advances in imaging technology.A 54-year-old man with blunt trauma and subsequent development of ischemic stroke and no clear initial evidence of carotid dissection with noninvasive screening, including magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and computed tomography angiography.Despite emerging noninvasive imaging techniques, conventional angiography should still be considered to establish a diagnosis of carotid artery dissection, particularly when other imaging modalities are negative or inconclusive but a high degree of clinical suspicion exists based on symptoms or mechanism of injury.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491448","annotations":[{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Carotid artery dissection","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_artery_dissection"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.74978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.588917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.569069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.404565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.32354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Mechanism (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
