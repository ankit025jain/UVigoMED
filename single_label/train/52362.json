{"id":52362,"title":"Early decrease of insulin sensitivity in offspring of individuals with type 2 diabetes. The Mexican Diabetes Prevention Study.","abstract":"Defects in insulin sensitivity (IS) and insulin secretion have been recognized as risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications. We undertook this study to establish the relationship between healthy type 2 diabetic offspring (OFD) from a Mexican population with IS.A total of 602 Mexican subjects, 359 first-degree offspring of T2D (OFD+) and 243 first-degree non-offspring of T2D (OFD-) were classified as young adults (age range, 18-44 years) and middle-aged adults (age range, 45-65 years). Groups were clinically and biochemically characterized. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was used to estimate IS and the homeostasis model assessment B (HOMA-B) was used to estimate B cell function.IS decreased significantly (p <0.05) in OFD+ middle-aged (QUICKI 0.330 ± 0.03) compared with OFD- (0. 370 ± 0.03). Middle-aged adults (OFD+) had the highest prevalence of increased fasting insulin levels (FIL) (13.6%) and decreased IS (22.9%) compared with OFD- groups (3.2%). A binary regression analysis showed the association of OFD+ with increased FIL (odds ratio [OR], 3.71; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.68-8.2; p = 0.001), and QUICKI (OR, 10.87; 95% CI, 2.36-44.69; p <0.01) adjusted by gender, age, and obesity.Our results suggest that decreased IS itself could be recognized as one of the earliest detectable abnormalities in middle-aged adults. Moreover, prevalence increases with age and is associated with type 2 diabetic offspring, regardless of obesity.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Endocrine System
