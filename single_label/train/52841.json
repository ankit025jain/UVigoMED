{"id":52841,"title":"Blunted diurnal cortisol pattern is associated with frailty: a cross-sectional study of 745 participants aged 65 to 90 years.","abstract":"The role of neuroendocrine alterations in the etiology of frailty syndrome is still poorly understood. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation is a plausible candidate pathway contributing to frailty. Thus, we sought to examine the associations of diurnal cortisol secretion with frailty in older adults.A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 745 study participants (age 65-90 years, mean age 75.1 years) of the population-based KORA Age study. Associations between salivary cortisol measures at awakening (morning 1 [M1]), 30 minutes after awakening (M2), and evening (E) and frailty criteria were determined.Lower cortisol levels in the first morning sample (M1) (P = .18) and M2 (P = .14) and increased E levels (P = .004) were observed in prefrail (35.17%, n = 262) and frail (3.36%, n = 25) individuals, in a dose-response manner. Frailty was strongly associated with smaller ratios of morning to evening levels; M1 to E ratio (P = .02) and M2 to E ratio (P = .003). Higher evening cortisol levels were associated with a 24% increased risk of a prefrail state (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.44). A smaller morning to evening ratio was associated with an increased risk of low grip strength (1.42, 1.09-1.86) and gait speed (1.31, 1.02-1.68).Frailty status is associated with blunted cortisol reactivity as demonstrated by lower morning and higher evening salivary cortisol levels.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564322","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.728162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis","weight":0.497097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.430556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Frailty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frailty"},{"name":"Diurnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality"},{"name":"Frailty syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frailty_syndrome"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Grip strength","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_strength"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Bodhi","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"M1 motorway","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway"}]}
