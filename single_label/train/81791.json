{"id":81791,"title":"Mandibular reconstruction with iliac crest free flap, nasolabial flap, and osseointegrated implants.","abstract":"Oncologic patients undergoing segmental mandibulectomy with soft tissue resection develop several esthetic and functional sequelae; therefore, the defect must be reconstructed immediately. The iliac crest flap is the only flap that allows reconstruction of the previous dimensions of the mandible. However, the excessive soft tissue of this flap prevents optimal reconstruction of intraoral soft tissue defects.This report describes a reconstructive technique used in 12 patients who underwent segmental mandibulectomy because of soft tissue defects resulting from tumor resection. The technique involves reconstruction of the mandible using an iliac crest flap combined with a nasolabial flap to enable subsequent reconstruction of the intraoral soft tissue and immediate placement of osseointegrated implants.The osseointegration success rate was 95.2% with a failure rate of 4.8%. Failure particularly affected the irradiated patients. Excellent functional and aesthetic results were obtained with the iliac crest free flap, nasolabial flap and osseointegrated dental implants.This technique has several advantages. On the one hand, it enables reconstruction of the original dimensions of the mandible, thus allowing immediate placement of implants in an ideal position for subsequent rehabilitation with a dental prosthesis. On the other hand, the nasolabial flap provides a thin layer of tissue that can be used to reconstruct the anatomy of the oromandibular soft tissue.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831940","annotations":[{"name":"Osseointegration","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.844949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Iliac crest","weight":0.827236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliac_crest"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.690355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.598102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.363198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.320812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Crest (heraldry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)"},{"name":"Failure (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
