{"id":44448,"title":"[Brain metastases occurring more often in colorectal carcinoma].","abstract":"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) has a high incidence. If metastatic disease develops, the liver and lungs are the most frequently involved sites. Brain metastases are rare.We present a male patient (70 years old) with lung and liver metastases of CRC. For many years the disease was in good remission with palliative chemotherapy. He developed very acute neck pain and later also vomiting. The latter turned out to be based on the presence of brain metastases, which was soon fatal.The incidence of CRC is rising and with it the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases in CRC. Due to the development of more effective systemic chemotherapy, survival of advanced CRC has improved, providing more time for symptomatic brain metastases to develop.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735811","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.72882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.59742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.540592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.487259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neck pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
