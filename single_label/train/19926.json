{"id":19926,"title":"Intrapartum management for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in resource-limited settings: a review of the literature.","abstract":"Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV guidelines in resource-limited settings focus on antenatal and postnatal management. In this review of the literature, we present findings from select studies, highlight best practices, and present evidence-based guidelines for intrapartum PMTCT management that are applicable to resource-limited settings. We discuss the roles of intrapartum HIV testing, intrapartum antiretroviral medications, mode of delivery in settings with and without HIV RNA testing, other delivery practices, and infant care in the immediate postnatal period. With the advent of Option B+, which recommends all HIV-infected pregnant women commence lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), the potential impact for intrapartum interventions will be greatest for those women who recently have seroconverted and those with unknown HIV status. Research on intrapartum PMTCT interventions should focus on these populations.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689322","annotations":[{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.869734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.59084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.559219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.46581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0594293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Criminal transmission of HIV","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_transmission_of_HIV"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"}]}
