{"id":63621,"title":"Predictors of early relapse in patients with non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis: results from the French nationwide CryoVas survey.","abstract":"Although in most patients induction therapy leads to complete or partial remission, relapses in patients with non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis (CryoVas) remain a major problem. We aimed to identify predictors of early relapses occurring within the first 12months of treatment in such patients.Patients included in the French CryoVas survey exhibiting complete/partial clinical remission and followed-up for at least 12months after induction therapy (n=145) were analyzed for predictors of early relapses.Forty out of 145 patients (28%) experienced early relapse. Relapses occurred after a median time of 9.5months after induction therapy (3-12) and involved skin (75%), joints and peripheral nerve (28% each), kidneys (25%) and gastrointestinal tract (5%). Baseline factors associated with an early relapse were purpura [HR 3.35 (1.02-10.97), P=0.046], cutaneous necrosis [HR 4.46 (1.58-12.57), P=0.005] and articular involvement [HR 2.20 (1.00-4.78), P=0.048]. The only factor negatively associated with an early relapse during follow-up was the achievement of complete immunological response [HR 0.07 (0.01-0.51), P=0.009]. The use of corticosteroids plus rituximab or cyclophosphamide tended to be associated negatively with early relapse [HR 0.43 (0.17-1.08), P=0.07].In patients with non-infectious CryoVas, main predictors of early relapses after initial remission are purpura, articular involvement, and cutaneous necrosis. The absence of complete immunological response during follow-up was associated with early relapse. These findings may help in adapting future treatment strategies.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418300","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.711828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.651976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.586589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cryoglobulinemia","weight":0.208635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryoglobulinemia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0315222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
