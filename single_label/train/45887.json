{"id":45887,"title":"Changes in T lymphocyte subsets in mice with CT26 colon tumors after treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to detect changes in T lymphocyte subpopulations in mice with CT26 subcutaneous colon cancer after treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and cyclophosphamide (CP) chemotherapy. A colon cancer model was established by subcutaneous injection of CT26 carcinoma cells into BALB/C mice. The mice were randomized into different treatment groups. We recorded survival times, tumor growth inhibition rates, histopathological changes, and T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of the mice. Mice treated with DLI and CP survived 33.5?±?5.02 days, which was significantly longer than the survival time of untreated control mice (16.7?±?2.98 days, P?<?0.01). In addition, the tumor inhibitory rate was higher in mice treated with DLI and CP (89.3 %) than that in mice treated with CP or DLI alone (67.1 and 34.5 %, respectively). There were higher levels of T lymphocytes that were CD3(+) and CD4(+) in mice treated with DLI alone or the combination of CP and DLI (P?<?0.05), and the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) cells was significantly improved in these mice (P?<?0.05). DLI combined with chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival and inhibited tumor growth in mice with CT26 colon cancer. This treatment might also improve immune function in these mice. Donor spleen cells that include high numbers of allogeneic lymphocytes and a few stem cells could induce a graft-versus-tumor effect, leading to elimination of residual cancer cells. This indicates that it is potentially a feasible adoptive cellular immunotherapy strategy for the management of solid tumors.","date":"2014-10-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659423","annotations":[{"name":"T cell","weight":0.90159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.888726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.76079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.730506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.684657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.653499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.640108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.341226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.303727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.282766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.18786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.140857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
