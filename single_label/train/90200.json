{"id":90200,"title":"[Clinical application of cyanoacrylates for prevention of cerebrospinal fluid leakage].","abstract":"To explore the effectiveness of cyanoacrylates (Fuaile) for spinal subdural benign tumorectomy to prevent the cerebrospinal fluid leakage.Between January 2009 and March 2013, 35 patients underwent spinal subdural benign tumorectomy. Of 35 patients, Fuaile and gelatin sponge were used after stitch suture for a watertight closure of the dura in 19 cases (trial group), and only gelatin sponge was used after stitch suture in 16 cases (control group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, disease duration, types of tumors, and sites of tumors between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The ratio of watertight closure, incision healing, and relative complications were compared between 2 groups.All patients in 2 groups achieved watertight closure of the dura intraoperatively. There was no significant difference in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of dura incision, hospitalization time, total drainage volume, and drainage time between 2 groups (P > 0.05). Primary incision healing was obtained; no delayed healing, infection, or nerve compression occurred in all patients. At last follow-up, the ratios of successful watertight closure of trial and control groups were 89.5% (17/19) and 50.0% (8/16) respectively, showing significant difference (P=0.02). No delayed cerebrospinal fluid leakage or incision infection was found at 1 and 3 months after operation.The application of cyanoacrylates for watertight closure of dura in spinal subdural benign tumorectomy is safe and effective.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640368","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.854062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.535634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.491951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.463881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.20264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.189465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dura mater","weight":0.147451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.121617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Cyanoacrylate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate"},{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"816","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/816"},{"name":"1719","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1719"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Waterproofing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterproofing"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid_rhinorrhoea"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
