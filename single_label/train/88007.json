{"id":88007,"title":"[Vacuum shoe system vs.forefoot offloading shoe for the management of metatarsal fractures. A prospective, randomized trial].","abstract":"Metatarsal fractures are managed using different types of forefoot offloading orthosis. Theaim of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical and pedographic results of a vacuum shoe system in comparison to a forefoot unloading shoe.20 patients (14 women/6 men--age: 36.4 +/- 14.1 years) were prospectively included in the study. The patients were followed up at four different time points. Detailed clinical and radiological examinations were carried out, functional scores were measured and a pedographic assessment was performed.Between the study groups no differences were seen in functional scoring. A complete bony healing was achieved within the 3 months of followup in all patients. The heelstrike to heelstrike time was without significant differences in the pedographic analysis. Adequate forefoot unloading was achieved with both orthosis. The load sharing between fore-, mid- and hindfoot showed no significant differences in the pedographic analysis. Patients' satisfaction was rated with higher values for the vacuum shoe system, but without significance.Both shoe systems show an adequate unloading of the forefoot. Therefore both orthosis may be used for the treatment of metatarsal fractures.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930327","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.735443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.492559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.379276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Shoe","weight":0.303635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0656504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.0617798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"}]}
