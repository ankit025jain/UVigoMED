{"id":56179,"title":"Biochemical restoration of aged human Bruch's membrane: experimental studies to improve retinal pigment epithelium transplant survival and differentiation.","abstract":"Suspensions of human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (hES-RPE) and human fetal RPE resurface aged and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Bruch's membrane to a limited degree at day 21 in organ culture. Survival and differentiation of hES-RPE and human fetal RPE on aged or AMD Bruch's membrane are enhanced greatly (200%) if a biologically synthesized extracellular matrix (bovine corneal endothelial cell extracellular matrix) is laid down on Bruch's membrane prior to transplantation. Transplanted RPE survival is enhanced even more (400-1,000%) if Bruch's membrane is treated with bovine corneal endothelial cell-conditioned medium during organ culture of hES-RPE or fetal RPE on aged or AMD Bruch's membrane. Future efforts are focused on identifying the bioactive components of bovine corneal endothelial cell-conditioned medium, so that this material can be reconstituted for clinical use as an adjunct to improve RPE transplant survival and differentiation in AMD eyes.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732767","annotations":[{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.827921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.775405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.696271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.622531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.597707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.541724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.470755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.363492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0930287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Organ culture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_culture"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"}]}
