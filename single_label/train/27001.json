{"id":27001,"title":"HDL and atherosclerosis: Insights from inherited HDL disorders.","abstract":"Plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) comprise a highly heterogeneous family of lipoprotein particles, differing in density, size, surface charge, and lipid and protein composition. Epidemiological studies have shown that plasma HDL level inversely correlates with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The most relevant atheroprotective function of HDL is to promote the removal of cholesterol from macrophages within the arterial wall and deliver it to the liver for excretion in a process called reverse cholesterol transport. In addition, HDLs can contribute to the maintenance of endothelial cell homeostasis and have potent antioxidant properties. It has been long suggested that individual HDL subclasses may differ in terms of their functional properties, but which one is the good particle remains to be defined. Inherited HDL disorders are rare monogenic diseases due to mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in HDL metabolism. These disorders are not only characterized by extremely low or high plasma HDL levels but also by an abnormal HDL subclass distribution, and thus represent a unique tool to understand the relationship between plasma HDL concentration, HDL function, and HDL-mediated atheroprotection.
