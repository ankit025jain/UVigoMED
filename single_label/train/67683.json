{"id":67683,"title":"[Capillary hemangioma in renal hilum; a case report].","abstract":"A 76-year-old woman with a capillary hemangioma in renal hilum is reported. She was referred to our hospital with left cystic renal tumor detected by ultrasonography during the hepatitis C follow-up. Computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal tumor in the left renal hilum with contrast effect. A hypervascular tumor in the renal hilum with severe fibrous adhesion was observed with laparoscopy and open tumorectomy was indicated. However, left radical nephrectomy was required because of severe adhesion. Histopathologic examination revealed capillary hemangioma without malignancy. Because preoperative diagnosis of capillary hemangioma was challenging, surgical excision was selected as a treatment for this rare entity.
