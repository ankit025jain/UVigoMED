{"id":70387,"title":"[Oncology PET imaging].","abstract":"At the beginning of this article, likening medical images to \"Where is Waldo?\" I indicate the concept of diagnostic process of PET/CT imaging, so that medical physics specialists could understand the role of each imaging modality and infer our distress for image diagnosis. Then, I state the present situation of PET imaging and the basics (e.g. health insurance coverage, clinical significance, principle, protocol, and pitfall) of oncology FDG-PET imaging which accounts for more than 99% of all clinical PET examinations in Japan. Finally, I would like to give a wishful prospect of oncology PET that will expand to be more cancer-specific in order to assess therapeutic effects of emerging molecular targeted drugs targeting the \"hallmarks of cancer\".","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199271","annotations":[{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Medical physics","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.599967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.56592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.540779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.534044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.338135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.314275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Civilization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization"},{"name":"Marketing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"}]}
