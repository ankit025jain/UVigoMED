{"id":65759,"title":"Contrast induced nephropathy: our experience.","abstract":"Even in the light of newer and less nephrotoxic contrast media solutions, their increased use during standard and new radiological procedures has resulted in the growing incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy, an iatrogenic disorder caused by exposure to contrast media. This retrospective study was conducted among the patients admitted in North Bengal Medical College from January 2007 to December 2010 with significant rise in serum creatinine level within 48 to 72 hours of systemic administration of contrast media. The study sample constituted 14 patients with mean age being 45.2 years. Among them, 10 patients (71.4%) required haemodialysis. One patient (7.1%) expired after receiving three sessions of haemodialysis. Three patients (21.4%) became dependent on haemodialysis. Once developed, contrast induced nephropathy is associated with high morbidity, long hospital-stay and patient becomes dependent on haemodialysis. Till now, no available current treatment can reverse or ameliorate the condition once it develops. Some precautionary measures taken in the high risk patients before administration of contrast medium is essential to reduce the incidence.","date":"2014-05-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783395","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.671355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.650072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.649065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.597221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.436637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.423041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"North Bengal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bengal"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Bengal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"},{"name":"Till (song)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till_(song)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
