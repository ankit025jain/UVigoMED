{"id":19384,"title":"Estimating the incidence and prevalence of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in publicly and privately insured claims databases in the United States.","abstract":"Juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP) is a chronic disease caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11. It is associated with significant morbidity that places intense physical, psychological, and financial strain on patients and their families. Few studies have assessed the incidence and prevalence of JORRP in the United States.This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study was performed using data from a pair of large insurance claims databases in the United States. The Optum Clinformatics and Truven MarketScan Medicaid databases represent a sample of privately and publicly insured children, respectively. Cohorts of children aged 0 to 17 years were created within each database to estimate the incidence and prevalence of JORRP in 2006. Claims-based algorithms were designed to capture as many potential cases as possible. To improve the accuracy of the incidence and prevalence estimates, chart validation was performed to estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the claims-based algorithms.The overall PPV-adjusted incidence of JORRP in 2006 was 0.51 per 100,000 in Optum and 1.03 per 100,000 in the MarketScan Medicaid population. Peak incidence was observed among 0- to 4-year-olds in both databases. The PPV-adjusted prevalence of JORRP in 2006 was 1.45 and 2.93 per 100,000 in the Optum and MarketScan Medicaid cohorts, respectively.Although relatively uncommon, JORRP represents a disease with significant morbidity. The incidence and prevalence of JORRP in publicly insured children were consistently higher than those covered by private insurance plans, suggesting an increased burden of illness among those with lower socioeconomic status.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722383","annotations":[{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.838973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.758399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.56297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medicaid","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.530783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.489226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.391667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.312081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.215637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Laryngeal papillomatosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_papillomatosis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Computer security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Private sector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
