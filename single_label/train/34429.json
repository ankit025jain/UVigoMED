{"id":34429,"title":"Laryngeal cleft: evaluation and management.","abstract":"Review the latest diagnostic and treatment modalities for laryngeal and laryngotracheoesophageal clefts as they can be a major cause of respiratory and feeding morbidity in the infant and pediatric population.Literature review of published reports.The presentation of laryngeal cleft usually involves respiratory symptoms, such as stridor, chronic cough, aspiration, and recurrent respiratory infections. Clefts of the larynx and trachea/esophagus can occur in isolation, as part of a syndrome (Opitz-Frias, VATER/VACTERL, Pallister Hall, CHARGE), or with other associated malformations (gastrointestinal, genitourinary, cardiac, craniofacial). This publication reviews the presenting signs/symptoms, diagnostic options, prognosis, and treatment considerations based on over a decade of experience of the senior author with laryngeal clefts.Type I laryngeal clefts can be managed medically or surgically depending on the degree of morbidity. Types II, III, and IV require endoscopic or open surgery to avoid chronic respiratory and feeding complications.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735606","annotations":[{"name":"Stridor","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridor"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.720725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.719848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.588116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.213079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Publishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
