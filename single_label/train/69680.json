{"id":69680,"title":"From monoclonal antibodies to chimeric antigen receptors for the treatment of human malignancies.","abstract":"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and their directly derived cell-based application known as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) ensue from the need to develop novel therapeutic strategies that retain high anti-tumor activity, but carry reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemo- and radiotherapies. In this concise review article, we will summarize the application of antibodies designed to target antigens expressed by tumor cells, and the transition from these antibodies to the generation of CARs.
