{"id":66813,"title":"Renal cell carcinoma: molecular biology and targeted therapy.","abstract":"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) continues to be the subject of vigorous clinical and translational investigation. Advances in systemic targeted therapies, new molecular pathways and immunotherapy approaches will be discussed.Agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways continue to be the mainstay for treating metastatic RCC (mRCC). Although enhanced target specificity has improved the toxicity profile associated with newer VEGF-pathway antagonists, durable complete responses remain the exception. Identification of novel pathways/agents, as well as the optimal sequencing and combination of existing targeted agents, remain areas of active study. In addition, emerging data from early clinical trials have reinvigorated interest in immunomodulatory agents.The therapeutic armamentarium available to genitourinary oncologists continues to grow, but much work remains to be done to fully realize the potential of pathway-specific targeted strategies and immune-based approaches for mRCC.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675233","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.809553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.693722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.681936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.494889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.464644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.459372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.201829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.122811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
