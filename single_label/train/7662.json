{"id":7662,"title":"Selective inhibition of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks) enhances mesenchymal stem cell engraftment and improves therapeutic efficacy for myocardial infarction.","abstract":"5-Diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7), formed by a family of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks), has been demonstrated to be a physiologic inhibitor of Akt. IP6K inhibition may increase Akt activation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), resulting in enhanced cardiac protective effect after transplantation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of IP6Ks for improving MSCs' functional survival and cardiac protective effect after transplantation into infarcted mice hearts. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, isolated from dual-reporter firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein positive (Fluc(+)-eGFP(+)) transgenic mice, were preconditioned with IP6Ks inhibitor TNP (0.5, 1, 5, and 10 ?mol/L) for 2 h followed by 6 h of hypoxia and serum deprivation (H/SD) injury. TNP concentration dependently significantly decreased IP7 production with increased Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, TNP at 10 ?mol/L significantly improved the viability and enhanced the paracrine effect of MSCs after H/SD. Furthermore, MSCs were transplanted into infarcted hearts with or without selective IP6Ks inhibition. Longitudinal in vivo bioluminescence imaging and immunofluorescent staining revealed that TNP pretreatment enhanced the survival of engrafted MSCs, which promoted the anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic efficacy of MSCs in vivo. Furthermore, MSC therapy with IP6Ks inhibition significantly decreased fibrosis and preserved heart function. This study demonstrates that inhibition of IP6Ks promotes MSCs engraftment and paracrine effect in infarcted hearts at least in part by down-regulating IP7 production and enhancing Akt activation, which might contribute to the preservation of myocardial function after MI.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Animal
