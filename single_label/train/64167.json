{"id":64167,"title":"Dedicator of cytokinesis 8-deficient patients have a breakdown in peripheral B-cell tolerance and defective regulatory T cells.","abstract":"Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is typified by recurrent infections, increased serum IgE levels, eosinophilia, and a high incidence of allergic and autoimmune manifestations.We sought to determine the role of DOCK8 in the establishment and maintenance of human B-cell tolerance.Autoantibodies were measured in the plasma of DOCK8-deficient patients. The antibody-coding genes from new emigrant/transitional and mature naive B cells were cloned and assessed for their ability to bind self-antigens. Regulatory T (Treg) cells in the blood were analyzed by means of flow cytometry, and their function was tested by examining their capacity to inhibit the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells.DOCK8-deficient patients had increased levels of autoantibodies in their plasma. We determined that central B-cell tolerance did not require DOCK8, as evidenced by the normally low frequency of polyreactive new emigrant/transitional B cells in DOCK8-deficient patients. In contrast, autoreactive B cells were enriched in the mature naive B-cell compartment, revealing a defective peripheral B-cell tolerance checkpoint. In addition, we found that Treg cells were decreased and exhibited impaired suppressive activity in DOCK8-deficient patients.Our data support a critical role for DOCK8 in Treg cell homeostasis and function and the enforcement of peripheral B-cell tolerance.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25218284","annotations":[{"name":"CD25","weight":0.921523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.78525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.741807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cytokinesis","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokinesis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.280046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.204374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.108671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
