{"id":41655,"title":"Transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E in Germany, 2013.","abstract":"The reported IgG seroprevalence against hepatitis E virus (HEV) in German blood donations is 6.8%, and HEV RNA detected in 0.08%, but documented evidence for HEV transmission is lacking. We identified two donations from a single donor containing 120 IU HEV RNA/mL plasma and 490 IU/mL. An infectious dose of 7,056 IU HEV RNA was transmitted via apheresis platelets to an immunosuppressed patient who developed chronic HEV. Further, transmission was probable in an immunocompetent child.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906377","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.751267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.562814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.457443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Apheresis","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheresis"},{"name":"Hepatitis E","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hepatitis E virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E_virus"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Hybrid electric vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Uncial 056","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_056"}]}
