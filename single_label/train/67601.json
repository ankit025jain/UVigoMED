{"id":67601,"title":"Effect on therapeutic ratio of planning a boosted radiotherapy dose to the dominant intraprostatic tumour lesion within the prostate based on multifunctional MR parameters.","abstract":"To demonstrate the feasibility of an 8-Gy focal radiation boost to a dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL), identified using multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), and to assess the potential outcome compared with a uniform 74-Gy prostate dose.The DIL location was predicted in 23 patients using a histopathologically verified model combining diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, T2 maps and three-dimensional MR spectroscopic imaging. The DIL defined prior to neoadjuvant hormone downregulation was firstly registered to MRI-acquired post-hormone therapy and subsequently to CT radiotherapy scans. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment was planned for an 8-Gy focal boost with 74-Gy dose to the remaining prostate. Areas under the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for prostate, bladder and rectum, the tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) were compared with those of the uniform 74-Gy IMRT plan.Deliverable IMRT plans were feasible for all patients with identifiable DILs (20/23). Areas under the DVHs were increased for the prostate (75.1?±?0.6 vs 72.7?±?0.3?Gy; p?<?0.001) and decreased for the rectum (38.2?±?2.5 vs 43.5?±?2.5?Gy; p?<?0.001) and the bladder (29.1?±?9.0 vs 36.9?±?9.3?Gy; p?<?0.001) for the boosted plan. The prostate TCP was increased (80.1?±?1.3 vs 75.3?±?0.9?Gy; p?<?0.001) and rectal NTCP lowered (3.84?±?3.65 vs 9.70?±?5.68?Gy; p?=?0.04) in the boosted plan. The bladder NTCP was negligible for both plans.Delivery of a focal boost to an mpMRI-defined DIL is feasible, and significant increases in TCP and therapeutic ratio were found.The delivery of a focal boost to an mpMRI-defined DIL demonstrates statistically significant increases in TCP and therapeutic ratio.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601648","annotations":[{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.825521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.787412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.711468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.699839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.678549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.402535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.391362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.325809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.251284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Histogram","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram"},{"name":"Transmission Control Protocol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
