{"id":70963,"title":"Overdiagnosis due to breast cancer screening: updated estimates of the Helsinki service study in Finland.","abstract":"Overdiagnosis is the most important adverse event of breast cancer screening with the estimates ranging from 0% to 40-50% depending on invitational age and methods. We updated the estimates of overdiagnosis in Helsinki service screening study in Finland by comparing the observed and expected cumulative incidence of all breast carcinomas and invasive breast carcinomas.Women aged 50-59 years have been invited to Helsinki service screening since 1986. The incidence of breast carcinoma in the first invited birth cohorts born in 1935-1939 was compared with older, non-invited cohorts. The minimum follow-up time of the invitees after the last screening round was 14 years. Expected cumulative incidence rates were estimated with two alternative approaches.For both any breast carcinoma and invasive breast carcinoma, the estimates of overdiagnosis varied from 5% (95% CI=-1, 11%) to 7% (95% CI=1, 13%) depending on the approach.Our estimates of overdiagnosis are of the same magnitude than other plausible estimates in Europe. Both alternative approaches produced similar estimates for the expected cumulative incidence, which increased the confidence in the estimates of overdiagnosis.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25121953","annotations":[{"name":"Overdiagnosis","weight":0.917136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdiagnosis"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.618581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.55683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.434575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.407594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.266938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.208867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Helsinki","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"1986","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Invitee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invitee"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Agunah","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agunah"}]}
