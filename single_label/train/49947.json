{"id":49947,"title":"The older adult with diabetes: peripheral neuropathy and walking for health.","abstract":"The rate at which older individuals are being diagnosed with diabetes is increasing. Therefore, the ability of older persons with diabetes to successfully age in place is of concern for health care professionals. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can cause changes to the foot and ankle such as loss of protective sensation, joint dislocations and fractures, and formation of cracks and fissures. With special attention to their needs, practitioners can tell older people with diabetes that walking for health can be safe and without problems and can contribute to their ability to spend the rest of their lives in their own home.
