{"id":69267,"title":"Elevated osteoprotegerin predicts declining renal function in elderly women: a 10-year prospective cohort study.","abstract":"Elevated osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels are inversely correlated with creatinine clearance and end-stage renal disease in patients with diabetes, however its role in predicting decline in renal function and progression to a more advanced stage disease in the elderly general population is unknown.This was a prospective cohort study of 1,157 elderly women with serum OPG measured in 1998 and renal function estimated using serum creatinine and cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 5-yearly intervals. The primary objective of the study was to determine the relationship of circulating OPG levels with 5- and 10-year renal decline.At baseline, participants with elevated OPG above the median (?2.2 ng/ml) had a 5.0% lower CKD-EPI-creatinine and cystatin C eGFR compared to participants with lower OPG levels. In multivariable-adjusted linear regression models, elevated OPG levels at baseline were associated with greater 5- and 10-year decline in CKD-EPI-creatinine and cystatin C eGFR (-0.105, p = 0.002 and -0.104, p = 0.010, respectively). Elevated OPG at baseline was associated with increased 5- and 10-year risk of rapid renal decline (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.33-3.43, p = 0.002 and OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.49-11.27, p = 0.006, respectively) and renal disease hospitalizations or deaths (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.31-3.03, p = 0.001) after adjusting for known risk factors.Elevated OPG levels are associated with long-term renal dysfunction and may be provide a useful biomarker to predict the trajectory of renal decline in older women.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457210","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.647712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.635141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.388223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Osteoprotegerin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoprotegerin"},{"name":"Cystatin C","weight":0.240173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin_C"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cystatin","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
