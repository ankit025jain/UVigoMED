{"id":91690,"title":"[Esophageal impaction of button batteries in childhood. How to avoid tragedy!].","abstract":"Ingestion of button batteries (PB) represents less than 2% of all foreign bodies, but its incidence is increasing. Esophageal impaction produces severe damages, which can be devastating. Our aim is to present 3 new cases and the therapeutic protocol followed in our center.We report 3 children who presented esophageal foreign body impaction, displaying a PB with the \"double halo sign\" on the radiograph, being situated in the upper, medium and low esophageal in each case. The protocol followed included: radiography of the neck, chest and abdomen; high doses of corticosteroids, inhibitors of proton pump, antibiotics and urgent endoscopy removal. A nasogastric tube was placed in the same act.The PB had been impacted for 10.3 hours (5-14) but had inflammation and necrosis of the esophageal mucosa. We applied the specified protocol. Oral feeding was initiated 8 +/- 2 days after with a normal esophagogastric study, which was repeated a month later to exclude stenosis.Adherence to a diagnostic and therapeutic protocol prevents the complications of esophageal impaction of button batteries. We consider the double halo image pathognomonic of the PB.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482908","annotations":[{"name":"Nasogastric intubation","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.501962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.42868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.406078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.378927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pathognomonic","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Double (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Button","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button"},{"name":"Impaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaction"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Halo (religious iconography)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(religious_iconography)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Petabyte","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Tragedy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
