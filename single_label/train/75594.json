{"id":75594,"title":"Ascorbate- and zinc-responsive parkinsonism.","abstract":"To report a case of Parkinsonism rapidly responsive to intravenous replacement of vitamin C and zinc.A 66-year-old man with Parkinsonism, pleural effusion, and bipolar disorder was found to have low serum vitamin C and zinc levels. Intravenous replacement of these micronutrients led to resolution of the movement disorder in less than 24 hours.Parkinsonism has been associated with vitamin C deficiency, and recent cases of scurvy complicated by Parkinsonism have responded well to intravenous replacement of vitamin C. In this case, deficiency of zinc may have contributed to the development of a movement disorder. The likely pathophysiology of, and treatment recommendations for, Parkinsonism linked to deficiencies of vitamin C and zinc are reviewed.Whereas vitamin C has a strong link with Parkinsonism, the potential role of zinc has only been suspected. This case report highlights some of the potential links between zinc deficiency and Parkinsonism.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070397","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.865191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.71171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.704257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.624854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Movement disorder","weight":0.56815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_disorder"},{"name":"Scurvy","weight":0.533237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.308091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 66","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_66"}]}
