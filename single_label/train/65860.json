{"id":65860,"title":"Tumour-suppressive microRNA-224 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting oncogenic TPD52 in prostate cancer.","abstract":"Our recent study of the microRNA expression signature of prostate cancer (PCa) revealed that microRNA-224 (miR-224) is significantly downregulated in PCa tissues. Here, we found that restoration of miR-224 significantly inhibits PCa cell migration and invasion. Additionally, we found that oncogenic TPD52 is a direct target of miR-224 regulation. Silencing of the TPD52 gene significantly inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, TPD52 expression is upregulated in cancer tissues and negatively correlates with miR-224 expression. We conclude that loss of tumour-suppressive miR-224 enhances cancer cell migration and invasion in PCa through direct regulation of oncogenic TPD52.
