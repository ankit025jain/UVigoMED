{"id":44294,"title":"Conventional stents versus stents loaded with (125)iodine seeds for the treatment of unresectable oesophageal cancer: a multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.","abstract":"The combination of stent insertion and single high-dose brachytherapy is a feasible and safe palliative treatment regimen in patients with unresectable oesophageal cancer. We aimed to further assess the efficacy of this treatment strategy compared to a conventional covered stent in patients with dysphagia caused by unresectable oesophageal cancer.Between Nov 1, 2009, and Oct 31, 2012, 160 patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either an irradiation stent (n=80) or a conventional stent (n=80). During a median follow-up of 138 days (IQR 72-207), 148 stents (73 in the irradiation group and 75 in the control group) were successfully placed into the diseased oesophagus in 148 participants. Median overall survival was 177 days (95% CI 153-201) in the irradiation group versus 147 days (124-170) in the control group (p=0.0046). Major complications and side-effects of the treatment were severe chest pain (17 [23%] of 73 patients in the irradiation group vs 15 [20%] of 75 patents in the control group), fistula formation (six [8%] vs five [7%]), aspiration pneumonia (11 [15%] vs 14 [19%]), haemorrhage (five [7%] vs five [7%]), and recurrent dysphagia (21 [28%] vs 20 [27%]).In patients with unresectable oesophageal cancer, the insertion of an oesophageal stent loaded with (125)iodine seeds prolonged survival when compared with the insertion of a conventional covered self-expandable metallic stent.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742740","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Aspiration pneumonia","weight":0.882475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.817748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.713405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.616645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Phase III trial","weight":0.380557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_III_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.358217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.310378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0312312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"}]}
