{"id":42645,"title":"Phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis C virus strains and risk factors associated with infection and viral subtypes among Iranian patients.","abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected approximately 170 million people worldwide. While the seroprevalence of anti-HCV antibody among Iranian blood donors is 0.13%, HCV infection is prevalent in 59-80% of Iranian injecting drug users. One hundred seventy-eight anti-HCV positive patients were referred to the Gastroenterology Department at the Taleghani Hospital (Tehran, Iran) between June 2007 and June 2012. Out of 178 samples, 142 were positive for HCV-RNA. HCV subtypes were determined using phylogenetic analysis of the NS5B or 5'UTR/core regions. Of 142 viremic patients, 71 (50%) were infected with HCV subtype 1a, 43 (30.3%) with subtype 3a, 20 (14.1%) with subtype 1b, 3 (2.1%) with subtype 4d, 2 (1.4%) with subtype 4a, 1 (0.7%) with subtype 2b, and 1 (0.7%) with subtype 6a. Interestingly, genetic analysis of a sub-genomic fragment from one patient identified a non-subtypeable HCV genotype-3 strain. There was a significant association between HCV subtype and a history of injecting drug use (P?=?0.003). Subtype 3a was predominant among patients with such a history. Injecting drug use was associated with younger age (P?<?0.001). HCV subtype was also significantly associated with a history of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (P?=?0.02). Subtype 1a was more frequent among patients with such a history. In addition, history of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was significantly associated with older age (P?=?0.002). In conclusion, while HCV subtype 1a is predominant among infected Iranian individuals, subtype 3a is predominant among Iranian injecting drug users.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838700","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.676284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.640517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.555004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.535634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.515904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.510982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.478027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.444669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"History","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Tehran","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
