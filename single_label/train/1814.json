{"id":1814,"title":"Aplasia cutis congenita: a rare case with extensive symmetrically distributed lesions.","abstract":"Aplasia cutis congenita is a rare developmental disorder of the skin of neonates, usually presenting as a solitary lesion over the scalp. We report an interesting presentation of AC along with the histopathological features in a neonate with extensive lesions over scalp as well as in bilaterally symmetrical areas over trunk and thighs; such symmetrical distributions being rarely reported.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25327077","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.598602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.238717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Aplasia cutis congenita","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia_cutis_congenita"},{"name":"Alternating current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"},{"name":"Developmental disorder","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder"}]}
