{"id":56383,"title":"Interobserver agreement in clinical grading of vitreous haze using alternative grading scales.","abstract":"To evaluate the reliability of clinical grading of vitreous haze using a new 9-step ordinal scale versus the existing 6-step ordinal scale.Evaluation of diagnostic test (interobserver agreement study).A total of 119 consecutive patients (204 uveitic eyes) presenting for uveitis subspecialty care on the study day at 1 of 3 large uveitis centers.Five pairs of uveitis specialists clinically graded vitreous haze in the same eyes, one after the other using the same equipment, using the 6- and 9-step scales.Agreement in vitreous haze grade between each pair of specialists was evaluated by the ? statistic (exact agreement and agreement within 1 or 2 grades).The scales correlated well (Spearman's ? = 0.84). Exact agreement was modest using both the 6-step and 9-step scales: average ? = 0.46 (range, 0.28-0.81) and ? = 0.40 (range, 0.15-0.63), respectively. Within 1-grade agreement was slightly more favorable for the scale with fewer steps, but values were excellent for both scales: ? = 0.75 (range, 0.66-0.96) and ? = 0.62 (range, 0.38-0.87), respectively. Within 2-grade agreement for the 9-step scale also was excellent (? = 0.85; range, 0.79-0.92). Two-fold more cases were potentially clinical trial eligible on the basis of the 9-step than the 6-step scale (P<0.001).Both scales are sufficiently reproducible using clinical grading for clinical and research use with the appropriate threshold (? 2- and ? 3-step differences for the 6- and 9-step scales, respectively). The results suggest that more eyes are likely to meet eligibility criteria for trials using the 9-step scale. The 9-step scale appears to have higher reproducibility with Reading Center grading than clinical grading, suggesting that Reading Center grading may be preferable for clinical trials.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697913","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.825112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.793177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.346741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.33047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.141109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Statistic","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"790","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/790"},{"name":"380","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/380"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Threshold model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_model"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Haze","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze"},{"name":"Pair skating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_skating"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"}]}
