{"id":61885,"title":"HS-438, a new inhibitor of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL T315I mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"Imatinib is a selective breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, T315I gene mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In the present study, we synthesized a novel BCR-ABL inhibitor, HS-438, and identified its anti-leukemic effects in vitro and in vivo. We found that HS-438 strongly inhibited the expression of BCR-ABL signaling pathways in wild-type BCR-ABL (BaF3/WT) cells as well as T315I-mutated BCR-ABL (BaF3/T315I) cells with resistance to imatinib. HS-438 induced cell cycle arrest, particularly during the G0/G1 cell cycle phase, and induced apoptosis. In BaF3/T315I xenograft models, HS-438 significantly delayed tumor growth, unlike imatinib. In summary, we suggest that HS-438 may be a novel drug candidate with the therapeutic potential to target BCR-ABL and overcome imatinib resistance in patients with CML.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657654","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.84784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.736829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.702753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.645245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.572261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.526962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.485739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.445291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.428393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Drug discovery","weight":0.419125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.199006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Cell cycle checkpoint","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0132532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"}]}
