{"id":84358,"title":"Genotype-phenotype correlation--promiscuity in the era of next-generation sequencing.","abstract":"Newly cost-effective next-generation sequencing has led to an explosion of discoveries of novel genetic mutations that reveal the rampant \"promiscuity\" of genotype-phenotype relationships. Such discoveries should ultimately revolutionize clinical care.
