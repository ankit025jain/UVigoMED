{"id":37862,"title":"Pulmonary hypertension in extremely low birth weight infants: characteristics and outcomes.","abstract":"To determine the characteristics and outcomes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.A retrospective case-control study of all ELBW infants admitted to a level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2010.During the study period, 450 ELBW infants were admitted. 6.4% (29/450) were diagnosed with PAH and were matched to 26 controls. The mean gestational age of infants with PAH and their controls were similar [24.5 ± 1.3 vs. 24.9 ± 1.8 weeks (P=0.26)]; however the cases were smaller at birth than were controls [640.7 ± 119.5 vs. 727.0 ± 184.5 g (P=0.04)]. The diagnosis of PAH was made at a mean postnatal age of 131.8 ± 53.7 days. Infants with PAH had a higher rate of intrauterine exposure to illicit maternal drug use [12/29 (41%) vs. 1/25 (4%); P=0.001], a longer duration of initial mechanical ventilation [74.9 ± 28.3 vs. 59.1 ± 27.8 days; P=0.04)], a higher incidence of severe BPD [23/29 (79%) vs. 13/26 (50%); P=0.02], and a greater NICU mortality rate [12/29 (41%) vs. 4/26 (15%); P=0.04].PAH in ELBW infants is associated with maternal illicit drug use in pregnancy, longer exposure to mechanical ventilation, severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and a significant increase in early mortality.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464663","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","weight":0.833244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopulmonary_dysplasia"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.776737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.731786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.676448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.453433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.267722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"}]}
