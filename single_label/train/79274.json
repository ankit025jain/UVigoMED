{"id":79274,"title":"Validation of the Thai five-minute hearing test to screen hearing loss in the community.","abstract":"Hearing impairment affects communication, social interactions, and quality of life. Audiometry is the gold standard method for hearing assessment. However, it is impractical in a country with limited resources. This study aimed to validate the Thai version of the Five-Minute Hearing Test (Thai-FMHT) to screen hearing loss in the community.The 558 subjects, including 176 males (32%) and 382 females (68%), completed all of the procedures. The optimal cutoff point for hearing loss in this screen was 8. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio of the Thai-FMHT to screen mild hearing loss (PTA0.5-2 kHz >25 dB) were 64.7% (95% CI, 56.1-72.7%), 60.0% (95% CI, 55.1-64.7%), and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.36-1.92), respectively. Regarding screening moderate hearing loss (PTA0.5-2 kHz >40 dB), the sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio of the Thai-FMHT were 93.1% (95% CI, 77.2-99.2%), 56.5% (95% CI, 55.1-64.7%), and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.9-2.5), respectively.The Thai-FMHT has a lower cutoff point than does the original one. This test is suitable for use as a screening tool for hearing loss in the community.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457423","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.723912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.445704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.441775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.324044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.314087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.270908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Hearing test","weight":0.123432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_test"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0464746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"558","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/558"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Parent-Teacher Association","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent-Teacher_Association"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Computer security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Metalworking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
