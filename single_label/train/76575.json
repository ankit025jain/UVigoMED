{"id":76575,"title":"Plasma chemerin levels in patients with multiple sclerosis.","abstract":"Chemerin, a novel adipokine produced by adipose tissue and liver, is associated with markers of metabolic syndrome, and additionally, acting as chemoattractant for cells of immune system it may regulate immune cell properties.In order to evaluate plasma chemerin concentration in multiple sclerosis (MS) individuals we investigated 39 MS patients (among them 23 subjects were lean and 16 were overweight or obese) and 42 controls with tension headaches (29 of them were lean and 13 were overweight or obese). All patients had a brain MRI scan with gadolinium contrast as well as an assessment of the presence of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and estimation of the CSF IgG index. The neurologic status was evaluated with use of the Expanded Disability Status Scale. Chemerin levels in plasma were measured using ELISA kit. Lipid profile, glucose and insulin levels, CRP and selected cytokine concentrations were also determined.Plasma chemerin concentrations in overweight/obese MS subjects were higher when comparing to lean MS individuals and the controls, both from lean and overweight/obese subgroups. Significant difference was found between the results of overweight/obese MS and lean controls.An increase of chemerin levels in patients with multiple sclerosis is associated with overweight and obesity.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24977972","annotations":[{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.921744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.762797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.716916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.58815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.545761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.274922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Oligoclonal band","weight":0.224824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoclonal_band"},{"name":"Tension headache","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_headache"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Expanded Disability Status Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_Disability_Status_Scale"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
