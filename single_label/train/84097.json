{"id":84097,"title":"Long term follow-up of the patients with pelvic organ prolapse after the mesh implantation using strict indication criteria.","abstract":"Transvaginal polypropylene mesh implantation is one of the techniques used for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair. The surgery outcomes depend on the indication criteria used. The aim of our study was to evaluate the outcomes of the mesh implantation using the strict indication criteria.In 47 women aged 61.7Â±8.3 years with pelvic organ prolapse (POP-Q?2) and a history of other surgery in the pelvic region outcomes of the mesh implantation were evaluated for up to 7 years (range 1-7 years).Forty six of 47 patients (97.8%) had a successful mesh implantation (10 anterior, 22 posterior, 14 combined). Peroperative complications occurred in 3 of 47 patients (6.4%). The anatomic cure (POP-Q?1) was achieved in 93.5% patients with mesh at 6 months after surgery. Any of the postoperative complications occurred in 16 of 46 women (34.8%). Significantly lower risk of complications was found in the group aged over 65 years compared to the younger patients (p=0.005).This is the first study on the mesh implantation including women only with the history or other surgery in the pelvic region, achieving high anatomic success rate and low risk of complications. Thus, our data support the use of the strict indication criteria for this procedure (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 14).","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174058","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.607037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.514089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.298177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.156848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.122553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"},{"name":"SESAMO","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SESAMO"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Post Office Protocol","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Organ (music)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"}]}
