{"id":59356,"title":"Improved chemosensitivity in cervical cancer to cisplatin: synergistic activity of mahanine through STAT3 inhibition.","abstract":"Toxicity reduction of cisplatin is necessary for improved treatment of cancer. Here we have demonstrated the synergistic growth-inhibitory effect of cisplatin on cervical cancer cells in-combination with a nontoxic herbal carbazole alkaloid, mahanine. Mahanine enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis and reduced its effective concentration ?5-8 folds. Mahanine inhibited JAK1 and Src and subsequently promoted proteasome-mediated degradation of STAT3. This event was further enhanced in-combination with cisplatin and subsequently inhibited cancer cell migration. Collectively, our results revealed that mahanine may be a prospective agent to reduce the concentration of cisplatin in adjunct for the treatment of cancer and thereby decreasing its toxicity.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831030","annotations":[{"name":"Alkaloid","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.898002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.819633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.567928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.507145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.505938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.413858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.318004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Activity (chemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Carbazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbazole"},{"name":"Janus kinase 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_1"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Janus kinase","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"}]}
