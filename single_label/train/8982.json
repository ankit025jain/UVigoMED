{"id":8982,"title":"Modulation of the host microenvironment by a common non-oncolytic mouse virus leads to inhibition of plasmacytoma development through NK cell activation.","abstract":"Although many cells undergo transformation, few actually develop into tumours, due to successful mechanisms of immunosurveillance. To investigate whether an infectious agent may play a role in this process, the growth of a plasmacytoma was investigated in mice infected by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus. Acutely infected animals were significantly protected against tumour development. The mechanisms responsible for this protection were analysed in mice deficient for relevant immune cells or molecules and after in vivo cell depletion. This protection by viral infection correlated with NK cell activation and with IFN-? production. It might also be related to activation of NK/T-cells, although this remains to be proven formally. Therefore, our results indicated that infections with benign micro-organisms may protect the host against cancer development, through non-specific stimulation of the host's innate immune system and especially of NK cells.
