{"id":90857,"title":"PTSD and TBI co-morbidity: scope, clinical presentation and treatment options.","abstract":"To summarize the literature on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their co-morbidity, focusing on diagnosis, clinical symptoms and treatment issues relevant to the clinician.Review of the literature.Pubmed searches were performed using the terms post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, sleep, cognitive, depression, anxiety, treatment and combinations of these terms. Those articles relevant to the objective were included.This study presents pathophysiological, neuroimaging and clinical data on co-morbid PTSD and TBI. It reviews associated conditions, emphasizing the impact of cognitive and sleep problems. It summarizes the emerging literature on treatment effectiveness for co-morbid PTSD and TBI, including psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and cognitive rehabilitation.Both PTSD and TBI commonly occur in the general population, both share some pathophysiological characteristics and both are associated with cognitive impairment and sleep disruption. PTSD and TBI present with a number of overlapping symptoms, which can lead to over-diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Both conditions are associated with co-morbidities important in diagnosis and treatment planning. More research is needed to elucidate what treatments are effective in PTSD and TBI co-morbidity and on factors predictive of treatment success.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568300","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.566335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.523117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.442761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.240282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0840959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Overdiagnosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdiagnosis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
