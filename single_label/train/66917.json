{"id":66917,"title":"Activated androgen receptor promotes bladder cancer metastasis via Slug mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.","abstract":"Androgen receptor (AR) has been indicated to be involved in bladder cancer progression. We showed androgen induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in AR-positive bladder cancer cells and promoted tumor metastasis in xenograft models. We subsequently identified that Slug was the mediator of EMT induced by androgen. Furthermore, upregulation of Slug was due to activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling in response to androgen. Finally, expression of AR showed strong correlation with loss of E-cadherin, higher expression of Slug and nuclear accumulation of ?-catenin in bladder tumor tissues. Taken together, our results suggest AR signaling promotes bladder cancer metastasis through Slug mediated EMT.
