{"id":40255,"title":"[Efficacy of the use of remnant stomach in esophagoplasty].","abstract":"In the period from 2001 till 2010 there were 117 extirpations of the oesophagus with single-stage plasty of the stomach in 94 patients and plasty of the large intestine--in 23 cases. Gastric resections were performed earlier in 50 (42.7%) patients, though gastrectomy took place in 39 (78%) patients. The accumulated experience allowed making an assessment of immediate and long-term results of esophagoplasty to patients, who had earlier the gastric resection. The incompetence of oesophagogastric anastomosis was noted in 2 times more frequent and the formation of stenosis of given anastomosis in 3 times more often. I order to improve the results of esophagoplasty, the method of serousmyotomy was applied in the cases of remnant stomach.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055529","annotations":[{"name":"List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)","weight":0.783982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Tag_Team_Champions_(WWE)"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"}]}
