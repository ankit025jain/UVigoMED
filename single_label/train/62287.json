{"id":62287,"title":"[Clinical characteristics and prognosis analysis of patients with LMP-1 positive Hodgkin's lymphoma after EBV infection].","abstract":"This study was purposed to investigate the expression of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) and CD68 in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients with EB virus infection and to analyze the relation of LMP-1 expression and CD68(+) tumor-associated macrophage count with clinical features and prognosis of HL patients. The expression of LMP1 and count of CD68(+) TAM were detected by immunohistochemical staining in tissue specimens of 72 HL patients; their correlation with clinical features and prognosis of HL patients was analyzed by using statistical method. The results showed that among tissue specimens of 72 HL patients, the positive rate of LMP-1 expression was 18.1% (13/72), the CD68(+) TAM count was more higher in LMP-1 positive expression [250 of CD68(+) TAM/high power field (hpf) is used as demarcation point] (P = 0.003). The statistical analysis showed that the LMP-1 positive expression was more observed in mixed type HL patients (P = 0.000); the positive rate of LMP-1 expression was much high in HL patients with albumin <40 g/L and age ? 45 years (P < 0.05). There was no relation of LMP-1 expression and CD68(+) TAM count with the short term therapeutic efficacy of HL patients, but the overall survival time of LMP-1 positive patients among patients followed-up for ? 5 years was short (P < 0.05). Moveover, no correlation of CD68(+) TAM count with the overall survival time of HL patients was found. It is concluded that the high count of CD68(+) TAM is more observed in LMP-1 positive expression of HL tissue, the LMP-1 expression states relates both with the pathological types, age and albumin level of patient with HL. The HL patients with LMP-1 positive expression have poor prognosis, suggesting that LMP-1 may be a new prognostic marker for HL patients.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
