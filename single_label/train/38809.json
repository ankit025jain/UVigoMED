{"id":38809,"title":"Gain-of-function KCNH2 mutations in patients with Brugada syndrome.","abstract":"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited disease characterized by right precordial ST segment elevation on electrocardiograms (ECGs) that predisposes patients to sudden cardiac death as a result of polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia or ventricular fibrillation (VF). In BrS patients, except for SCN5A, mutations in other responsible genes are poorly elucidated.We identified 4 KCNH2 mutations, T152I, R164C, W927G, and R1135H, in 236 consecutive probands with BrS or Brugada-like ECG. Three of these mutation carriers showed QTc intervals shorter than 360 milliseconds and 1 experienced VF. We performed patch-clamp analyses on I(Kr) reconstituted with the KCNH2 mutations in Chinese hamster ovary cells and compared the phenotypes of the patients with different genotypes. Three mutations, R164C, W927G, and R1135H, increased I(Kr) densities. Three mutations, T152I, R164C, and W927G, caused a negative shift in voltage-dependent activation curves. Only the R1135H mutant channel prolonged the deactivation time constants. We also identified 20 SCN5A and 5 CACNA1C mutation carriers in our cohort. Comparison of probands' phenotypes with 3 different genotypes revealed that KCNH2 mutation carriers showed shorter QTc intervals and SCN5A mutation carriers had longer QRS durations.All KCNH2 mutations that we identified in probands with BrS exerted gain-of-function effects on I(Kr) channels, which may partially explain the ECG findings in our patients.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
