{"id":42550,"title":"Molecular profiling in gastric cancer: examining potential targets for chemotherapy.","abstract":"Current NCCN guidelines recommend epirubicin (E), cisplatin (C), and 5-fluorouracil (F) as a first-line therapeutic approach for operable gastric adenocarcinoma (GC). Molecular profiling (MP) was used to evaluate the expression of chemotherapy targeted biomarkers associated with ECF therapy and other first-line cytotoxic regimens for GC.GC specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TOP2A, TS, ERCC1, PGP, and TOPO1 expression (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ) from 2009 to 2012.A total of 230 GC specimens were analyzed. The median age of patients was 61 (IQR: 50-72) years with the majority being male (n = 139, 60%). IHC actionable targets included: 60% (n = 138) high TOP2A, 55% (n = 127) negative ERCC1, and 63% (n = 145) negative TS, indicating potential benefit from E, C, and F, respectively. Simultaneous expression analysis demonstrated only 24% (n = 55) of patients had gene expression levels that suggested uniform sensitivity to ECF. Biomarker results of 6.5% (n = 15) of patients revealed a potential complete lack of sensitivity to first-line ECF.MP of GC has the potential to define patients who would derive the greatest benefit from current therapies. Prospective controlled studies are required to validate the role of biomarkers in the management of GC patients.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844210","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.811578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epirubicin","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirubicin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.632129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.54469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.518093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"National Comprehensive Cancer Network","weight":0.466741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Comprehensive_Cancer_Network"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.293877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Phoenix, Arizona","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona"},{"name":"ERCC1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCC1"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Extracellular fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_fluid"}]}
