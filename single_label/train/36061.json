{"id":36061,"title":"Surgical outcome of Chiari I malformation in children: clinico-radiological factors and technical aspects.","abstract":"The optimal treatment for Chiari I malformation in children is still under debate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcome of the pediatric Chiari I malformation,focusing on clinico-radiological factors and technical aspects.Fifty-six patients with Chiari I malformation who received surgery at Seoul National University Childrenâ€™s Hospital were included. The mean age was 7.9 years. The patients were divided into three groups: group I (n =8) with hydrocephalus, group II (n =11) without syrinx, and group III (n =37) with syrinx. Group I received shunting operation initially,and others received foramen magnum decompression (FMD). Group III was further subdivided: group IIIa (n =9), minimal intradural manipulation, and group IIIb (n =27), active intradural manipulation. The outcomes were compared between the groups. The mean follow-up period was 75.9 months.In group I, symptoms were resolved or had improved in most patients, with only one patient received additional FMD. Symptoms resolved or improved in 10 (91 %) and 25 cases (84 %) in groups II and III, respectively. Syrinx was markedly decreased in 31 cases (86 %) in group III. FMD was less effective for scoliosis (improved or stabilized in 57 %).The persistence of syrinx was related with an aggravation of scoliosis. The outcomes between group IIIa and IIIb showed no significant difference.In most pediatric Chiari I patients with hydrocephalus,a shunting operation was sufficient. FMD showed high efficacy in treating patients without hydrocephalus. The extent of the intradural procedure did not have a significant effect on the clinical outcome.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604349","annotations":[{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.671666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.579085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.525607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Arnold-Chiari malformation","weight":0.388007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold-Chiari_malformation"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Foramen magnum","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen_magnum"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Seoul National University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University"},{"name":"Syrinx (bird anatomy)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy)"},{"name":"Seoul","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul"},{"name":"Childrens Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childrens_Hospital"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Spinal manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_manipulation"},{"name":"Aggravation (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggravation_(law)"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"Chiari malformation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiari_malformation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Foramen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen"},{"name":"Boron group","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group"},{"name":"Spinal tumor","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_tumor"}]}
