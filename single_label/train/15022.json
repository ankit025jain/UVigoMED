{"id":15022,"title":"Spontaneous and experimental malignancies in non-human primates.","abstract":"Contrary to earlier established opinion that tumors in monkeys are found rarely, now the large material confirms that monkey tumors are frequent phenomenon. Tumor incidence clearly increases with age. Frequencies of benign and malignant tumors of various locations and histogenesis are slightly different. Tumors of hematopoietic system are the most frequent. Sporadic cases and enzootic outbreaks of lymphomas are described for different kinds of monkeys, including apes, and probably are caused by viruses. Two viruses were isolated by us from sick monkeys - the retrovirus C-type STLV-1 and the herpes virus papio HVP. Inoculation of virus cultures into monkeys and rabbits induces neoplasms. Monkey neoplasms can be induced by exposure to various chemical agents, and by oncogenic and non-oncogenic viruses. There is no strict species specificity of tumor viruses. The role of polyoma viruses in neoplasms etiology is discussed.
