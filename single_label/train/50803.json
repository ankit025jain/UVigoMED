{"id":50803,"title":"Fertility preservation options for women treated for cancer.","abstract":"Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can be damaging to reproductive organs and can decrease fertility in women of reproductive age. For women who may wish to try to preserve their fertility, it's important for clinicians to discuss potential options with women before the initiation of cancer treatment to maintain as many preservation options as possible. Embryo cryopreservation, oocyte cryopreservation and ovarian tissue cryopreservation are potential options, but most of these methods are still considered experimental and may not be an option for every woman.
