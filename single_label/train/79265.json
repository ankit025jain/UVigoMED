{"id":79265,"title":"[Expression and significance of hMSH2 protein in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma].","abstract":"To study the expression and significance of hMSH2 protein in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.The expression of hMSH2 protein were detected by immunohistochemistry SP method in 51 cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, the control group included 30 cases of atypical hyperplasia tissue of vocal fold and 16 cases of normal laryngeal tissue.The expression rates of hMSH2 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, atypical hyperplasia tissue of vocal fold and normal laryngeal tissue were 58.8%, 73.3%, 87.5% respectively. There was significant difference among them (P < 0. 05). The expression of hMSH2 in laryngeal carcinoma was not associated with location and T stage (P > 0.05), but the expression was related with metastasis of lymph node and differentiation level (P < 0.05).The deletion of hMSH2 maybe participate the early occurrence of laryngeal carcinoma; hMSH2 protein maybe delay and suppress oncogenesis and development of laryngeal carcinoma.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459922","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.809475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.587905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.565117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.54985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"MSH2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSH2"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
