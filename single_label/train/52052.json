{"id":52052,"title":"Effect of chronic hyperglycemia on crystallin levels in rat lens.","abstract":"Crystallins are the major structural proteins in the vertebrate eye lens that contribute to lens transparency. Although cataract, including diabetic cataract, is thought to be a result of the accumulation of crystallins with various modifications, the effect of hyperglycemia on status of crystallin levels has not been investigated. This study evaluated the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on crystallin levels in diabetic cataractous rat lens. Diabetes was induced in rats by injecting streptozotocin and maintained on hyperglycemia for a period of 10weeks. At the end, levels of ?-, ?-, ?-crystallins and phosphoforms of ?B-crystallins (?BC) were analyzed by immunoblotting. Further, solubility of crystallins and phosphoforms of ?BC was analyzed by detergent soluble assay. Chronic diabetes significantly decreased the protein levels of ?-, ?- and ?A-crystallins (?AC) in both soluble and insoluble fraction of lens. Whereas ?-crystallin levels were decreased and ?BC levels were increased in lens soluble fraction with no change in insoluble fraction in diabetic rat lens. Although, diabetes activated the p38MAPK signaling cascade by increasing the p-p38MAPK in lens, the phosphoforms of ?BC were decreased in soluble fraction with a concomitant increase in insoluble fraction of diabetic lens when compared to the controls. Moreover, diabetes strongly enhances the degradation of crystallinsand phosphoforms of ?BC in lens. Taken together, the decreased levels of crystallins and insolubilization of phosphoforms of ?BC under chronic hyperglycemia could be one of the underlying factors in the development of diabetic cataract.
