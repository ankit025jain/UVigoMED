{"id":90390,"title":"Human polyethylene granuloma tissues inhibit bone healing in a novel xenograft animal model.","abstract":"During revision of a conventional polyethylene joint replacement, surgeons usually remove the source of osteolysis (polyethylene) but cannot always remove all of the polyethylene granuloma tissues. We developed a human/rat xenograft model to investigate the effects of polyethylene granuloma tissues on bone healing. Human osteoarthritic and periprosthetic tissues collected during primary and revision hip arthroplasty surgeries were transplanted into the distal femora of athymic nude rats. After 3 weeks in vivo, there was a significant difference in the bone volume fraction (Vf ) between empty, primary, and revision defects (p?=?0.02), with a lower Vf in defects with revision granuloma tissues compared to defects with primary osteoarthritic tissues. Polyethylene granuloma tissues in trabecular bone defects inhibited bone healing. Therefore, debridement around a metal-on-polyethylene hip replacement may shorten the time it takes to achieve secondary stability around a revision hip replacement.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619566","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.787718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.770957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.754588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.742055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.716365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.686939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.684821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.654808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.636901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.613015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.563644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.514252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.35323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.159155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.100243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
