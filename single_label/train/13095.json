{"id":13095,"title":"[Effects of raloxifene combined with conjugated equine estrogen on prothrombotic state in ovariectomized rats].","abstract":"To study effects of raloxifene (RLX) with different doses of conjugated equine estrogen(CEE) on prothrombotic profiles in the ovariectomized rats model.Total of 32 healthy female SD rats at age of 9 to 10 months were equally divided into every 8 rats at 4 groups randomly. One week after ovariectomized, they were treated by drugs, including control group with placebo(0.9% Nacl intragastric administration), RLX group with RLX 6 mg/(kg·d), RLX and low CEE group with RLX 6 mg/(kg·d) + CEE 0.07 mg/ (kg·d) and RLX and high CEE group with RLX 6 mg/ (kg·d) + CEE 0.5 mg/ (kg·d) for 10 weeks before death. Thrombin turbidimetry method was used to evaluate the plasma fibrinogen(FIB), transmitting substrate method for antithrombin III(ATIII) activity, double-antibody sandwich ELISA for plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), D-dimer (D-D) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) and nitrate reductase method for nitric oxide(NO).(1) Coagulation and anticoagulation indicators: it was observed (1.62 ± 0.22) g/L FIB at control group, (2.02 ± 0.54) g/L at RLX group, (1.97 ± 0.16) g/L at RLX and low CEE group, (2.00 ± 0.18) g/L at RLX and high CEE group. There was a statistically significant difference between control group and any one of treatment groups (P < 0.05) and no statistical significance among those three treatment groups (P > 0.05). No significant change was observed in plasma ATIII activity among groups (P > 0.05). (2) Fibrinolytic and anti-fibrinolytic indicators: it was observed (14.1 ± 2.8) µg/L PAI-1 at control group, (20.0 ± 3.3) µg/L at RLX group, (41.5 ± 5.5) µg/L at RLX and low CEE group, (38.9 ± 6.0) µg/L at RLX and high CEE group. A remarkable increase was observed between control group and any one of treatment groups (P < 0.05) . But there was no significant difference of D-D among groups (P > 0.05) . (3) Endothelial function: it was (43 ± 7) % vWF at control group, (49 ± 5) % at RLX group, (46 ± 6) % at RLX and low CEE group, (36 ± 5) % at RLX and high CEE group. The vWF of RLX and high CEE group was the lowest among all groups (P < 0.05) . There was no difference of NO among groups (P > 0.05).In the different links of thrombosis, RLX gives different function and may increase the risk. CEE plays a synergism role in the matter of fibrinolysis and anti-fibrinolysis with RLX, further giving rise to thrombosis effect of RLX. And it also has a protective role in the function of vascular endothelium to some extent. But this only works with high dose.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495689","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.916687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1","weight":0.91149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator_inhibitor-1"},{"name":"Von Willebrand factor","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.876028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.826185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.801236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Antithrombin","weight":0.798359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithrombin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.738829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.678183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.644599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Nitrate","weight":0.516808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.510716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.481682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Antifibrinolytic","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifibrinolytic"},{"name":"Premarin","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premarin"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Raloxifene","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raloxifene"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Von Willebrand disease","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0541379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Equus (genus)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(genus)"}]}
