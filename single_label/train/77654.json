{"id":77654,"title":"Recent trends in published occupational cancer epidemiology research: results from a comprehensive review of the literature.","abstract":"To assess trends in occupational cancer epidemiology research through a literature review of occupational health and epidemiology journals.Fifteen journals were reviewed from 1991 to 2009, and characteristics of articles that assessed the risk of cancer associated with an occupation, industry, or occupational exposure, were incorporated into a database.The number of occupational cancer epidemiology articles published annually declined in recent years (2003 onwards) in the journals reviewed. The number of articles presenting dose-response analyses increased over the review period, from 29% in the first 4 years of review to 49% in the last 4 years.There has been a decrease in the number of occupational cancer epidemiology articles published annually during the review period. The results of these articles help determine the carcinogenicity of workplace exposures and permissible exposure limits, both of which may be hindered with a decline in research.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488816","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.519333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.389204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Occupational disease","weight":0.307942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_disease"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.170536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Incorporation (business)","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Exposure assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_assessment"},{"name":"1991","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Epidemiology of cancer","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_cancer"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
