{"id":64684,"title":"Defunctioning polymorphism in the immunoglobulin G inhibitory receptor (Fc?RIIB-T/T232) does not impact on kidney transplant or recipient survival.","abstract":"There is an increasing appreciation of the deleterious effects of antibody and B cells on acute and chronic transplant outcomes. Many effector functions of antibody are mediated by a family of receptors (Fc?Rs) that are expressed on most immune cells, including neutrophils, natural killer cells, and B cells. Most Fc?Rs are activating and controlled by a single inhibitory receptor, Fc?RIIB (CD32B), which also regulates some aspects of B-cell activation and antibody production. Fc?RIIB-deficient mice develop severe chronic arteriopathy in a murine cardiac allograft model. A single nucleotide polymorphism in human Fc?RIIB (rs1050501) results in profound receptor dysfunction and is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. The frequency of this Fc?RIIB-I/T232 polymorphism also shows significant racial variation.In the present study, we sought to determine whether the Fc?RIIB-I/T232 single nucleotide polymorphism rs1050501 affected susceptibility to renal allograft rejection or loss and transplant recipient survival. Fc?RIIB-I/T232 genotype was determined in 2,851 Caucasian and 570 Afro-Caribbean renal transplant recipients, and in 236 transplant recipients with a primary diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, all of whom were enrolled into the Collaborative Transplant Study.We found no significant difference in pretransplant panel reactive antibodies, acute rejection at 1-year nor in 10-year transplant or patient survival in individuals with differing Fc?RIIB-I/T232 genotype.This negative result is surprising, given the importance of this receptor in modulating antibody effector function.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022320","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin
