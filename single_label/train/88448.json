{"id":88448,"title":"The voices of Brazilian women breaking free from intimate partner violence.","abstract":"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global problem with a direct effect on the health of the victims and their communities. With the intention to inform nursing care delivered to women experiencing IPV, this qualitative study was conducted, specifically to understand the meaning that IPV has for assaulted women and to identify the factors that contribute to breaking the cycle of violence. Data collection included interviews and discussion of photographs. Participants were recruited from within a shelter for women experiencing violence. Findings from five women were inductively coded into three categories: \"experiencing violent acts,\" which describes the period in which the women lived with the aggressor; \"marks of the violent acts,\" which portrays the consequences of IPV; and \"women's support,\" which indicates the current supports or lack thereof for these women. Nurses and other healthcare providers will benefit from hearing the women's voices through their words and photographs and will recognize the need for holistic care that includes the physical, sexual, and emotional needs of abused women.
