{"id":82894,"title":"A clinico-pathologic correlation.","abstract":"A 66-year-old female was referred to our department for evaluation of exposed bone in the hard palate. She was asymptomatic at the time of her initial consultation; however, she was concerned about a non-healing lesion that had been present for five months. The patient reported having injured her hard palate while eating sometime in November 2011. Subsequently she was followed by her general dentist, who had noticed improvement of the area. Approximately three months later, she noticed worsening of the lesion along with discomfort. She was conservatively managed at that point with penicillin and chlorhexidine mouth rinse without any improvement of her condition.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494268","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.677871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.432489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.238329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hard palate","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_palate"},{"name":"Mouthwash","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthwash"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 66","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_66"}]}
