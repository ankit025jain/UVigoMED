{"id":56577,"title":"Oxidative stress regulation by DJ-1 in the retinal pigment epithelium.","abstract":"DJ-1 is a protein expressed in many tissues including the brain where it has been extensively studied due to its association with Parkinson's Disease (PD). DJ-1 was reported to function as an antioxidant, redox-sensitive molecular chaperone, and transcription regulator, which protected cells from oxidative stress by modifying signaling pathways that regulate cell survival. Here we discuss our progress toward characterization of the DJ-1 function in the protection of RPE to oxidative stress.
