{"id":9568,"title":"The frequency of invariant natural killer T cells correlates with the severity of myocarditis.","abstract":"Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) perform different functions in different diseases. The cells were reported to protect myocarditis. However, the detail relationships between iNKT and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis remain unclear. In order to investigate the correlation between the severity of CVB3-induced inflammation infiltration and the proportion of iNKT in the spleen and circulating blood, BALB/c mice were grouped into three groups according to the inflammation infiltration area of heart sections. The proportion of iNKT in CD3-positive cells in the spleen correlated negatively with the inflammation area (linear fit; R(2)=0.93) and virus capsid protein VP1 (linear fit; R(2)=0.84) in the myocardial tissue, while the proportion of iNKT in CD3-positive cells in the PBMC positively correlated with the inflammation area (linear fit; R(2)=0.91) and virus capsid protein VP1 (linear fit; R(2)=0.93) in the myocardial tissue. The results imply that iNKT might be used as a parameter for the diagnosis of myocarditis in clinical practice.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702483","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.742918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.735016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.693722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.592698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Myocarditis","weight":0.408908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.380273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.256869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Natural Killer T cell","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Killer_T_cell"},{"name":"Coxsackievirus","weight":0.118284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsackievirus"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.0315222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Niacin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin"},{"name":"Invariant (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Invariant (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Destination marketing organization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destination_marketing_organization"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"VP Records","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP_Records"}]}
