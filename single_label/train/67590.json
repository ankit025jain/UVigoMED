{"id":67590,"title":"Burden and predictors of hypertension in India: results of SEEK (Screening and Early Evaluation of Kidney Disease) study.","abstract":"Hypertension (HTN) is one of the major causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The objective of the study was to investigate the burden and predictors of HTN in India.6120 subjects participated in the Screening and Early Evaluation of Kidney disease (SEEK), a community-based screening program in 53 camps in 13 representative geographic locations in India. Of these, 5929 had recorded blood pressure (BP) measurements. Potential predictors of HTN were collected using a structured questionnaire for SEEK study.HTN was observed in 43.5% of our cohort. After adjusting for center variation (p < 0.0001), predictors of a higher prevalence of HTN were older age ? 40 years (p < 0.0001), BMI of ? 23 Kg/M2 (p < 0.0004), larger waist circumference (p < 0.0001), working in sedentary occupation (p < 0.0001), having diabetes mellitus (p < 0.0001), having proteinuria (p < 0.0016), and increased serum creatinine (p < 0.0001). High school/some college education (p = 0.0016), versus less than 9th grade education, was related with lower prevalence of HTN. Of note, proteinuria and CKD were observed in 19% and 23.5% of HTN subjects. About half (54%) of the hypertensive subjects were aware of their hypertension status.HTN was common in this cohort from India. Older age, BMI ? 23 Kg/M2, waist circumference, sedentary occupation, education less, diabetes mellitus, presence of proteinuria, and raised serum creatinine were significant predictors of hypertension. Our data suggest that HTN is a major public health problem in India with low awareness, and requires aggressive community-based screening and education to improve health.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602391","annotations":[{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.845535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.728506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"India","weight":0.552663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.203971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Allopatric speciation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
