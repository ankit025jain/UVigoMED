{"id":4133,"title":"[Parenteral nutrition--temporary and permanent treatment].","abstract":"Enteral nutrition of an elderly patient having ended up in hospital or intensive care and suffering from malnutrition should be started as soon as it is technically possible. If less than 60% of the estimated energy need is fulfilled during the first week of treatment, parenteral nutrition should also be initiated. Multi-chamber bags are the most effective means to provide energy and nutrients via the central vein. To reduce the risk of liver damage, parenteral nutrition is upon prolongation recommended to be administered periodically. Weight monitoring is important in order to observe the effect of the treatment and the possible accumulation of fluid load.","date":"2015-01-13","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25582023","annotations":[{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.531202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.397499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.288801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.139972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.121984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Enteral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteral"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"}]}
