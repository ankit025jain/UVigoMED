{"id":69264,"title":"Korean patients taking ?1-adrenergic receptor antagonists show lower incidence of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome than western patients.","abstract":"To evaluate the incidence and clinical manifestations of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) according to iris alterations in Korean patients taking ?1-adrenergic receptor antagonists (?1-ARAs).This is a prospective observational study. Two surgeons performed cataract surgery in 758 eyes of 596 patients over a period of 12 months. Past medical history was reviewed, especially whether patients had been taking systemic ?1-ARAs. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed to measure the iris thickness of the dilator muscle region (DMR) at half the distance between the scleral spur and the pupillary margin. Pupil diameter was measured and the occurrence of IFIS was recorded. Measurements of the ?1-ARA group were compared with those of a control group matched for age and sex.IFIS occurred only in six eyes of four patients on systemic ?1-ARA medications (0.8%). Pupil diameter in the ?1-ARA medication group and the control group was not significantly different. The difference in mean DMR thickness in patients taking an ?1-ARA and in the control group was also not statistically significant (p=0.641). However, within the ?1-ARA population, the DMR thickness of IFIS cases was significantly lower than that of non-IFIS cases (p=0.013) CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of IFIS was far lower in Korean patients than that reported for western patients. IFIS patients taking ?1-ARAs showed significantly greater iris DMR thinning than non-IFIS patients taking ?1-ARAs. Our findings indicate that the interaction between ?1-ARAs and melanin, which results in iris DMR atrophy and IFIS, is less strong in Korean patients (with dark irises) than western patients.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457366","annotations":[{"name":"Melanin","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.658496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.577504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.53667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.439691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.384276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.337506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.301722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.0326281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_floppy_iris_syndrome"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Iris dilator muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_dilator_muscle"},{"name":"Scleral lens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Western culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"}]}
