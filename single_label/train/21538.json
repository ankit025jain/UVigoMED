{"id":21538,"title":"[The clinical analysis of 419 severe sepsis patients in intensive care unit].","abstract":"To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and mortality risk factors of severe sepsis patients admitted into intensive care unit (ICU).The clinical data of 419 severe sepsis patients admitted to an adult ICU of Beijing Friendship Hospital from January 2009 to December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed and evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify independent risk factors for the death of patients with severe sepsis during ICU stay.Overall ICU mortality was 43.9% (184/419), and the respiratory tract was the most common site of infection (50.8%), followed by infection of the gastrointestinal tract and abdominal cavity (27.8%), and hematogenous infection (4.3%). Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens [46.0%(214/465)]. Iatrogenic infections accounted for 53.7% (225/419) of the enrolled patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that age [odds ratio(OR)=0.003, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.015-1.056, P=0.000], vasoactive drug application (OR=3.251, 95%CI 1.562-6.768, P=0.002), failure of 3 or more organs (OR=2.452, 95%CI 1.015-5.924, P=0.046), and iatrogenic infection (OR=1.775, 95%CI 0.981-3.221, P=0.046) were independent risk factors for ICU mortality.Severe sepsis is a common cause of ICU admission. Patients with risk factors for high mortality should be carefully monitored, and aggressive treatment should be administered.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598290","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.820814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Abdominal cavity","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cavity"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.640853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.554854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.352127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Vasoactive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
