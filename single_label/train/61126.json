{"id":61126,"title":"[Why infusion surgery did not start clinical transfusiology?].","abstract":"The article is devoted to the history of blood transfusion in the XVII century. The theoretical basis of the method was the publication in 1628 in London W. Harvey hypothesis about the circulation of blood, and the practical - conducted in 1656 in Oxford K. Wren experiments to inject of various liquids into the bloodstream. Methods for blood transfusions from animals to animals in February-April 1667 developed in England R. Lower and E. King. The priority of the first transfusion of blood from the animal to man belongs to France. June 15, 1667 in Paris J.-B. Denis and barber-surgeon P. Emmerez using the Lower-King method transfused blood of a lamb to patients suffering from anemia. During the 2nd half of 1667 -- the spring of 1668 R. Lower, E. King and S. Pepis in England, J.-B. Denis and P. Emmerez in France, G. Riva and P.Manfredi in Italy, B. Kauffmann and M. Portmann in Germany had several successful blood transfusions. A total of 19 procedures done 10 sick people and 2 healthy man, but in the spring of 1668 public opinion related the death of a patient to the procedure. The Paris court held in April 1668 limited the blood transfusions, which in 1678 has been discontinued by law, without offering no impact on its renewal in the XIX century.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761467","annotations":[{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.835208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"England","weight":0.739266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.671459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.643122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.643122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.606934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.566265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"London","weight":0.491068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"},{"name":"Paris","weight":0.481314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"},{"name":"France","weight":0.469272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"History","weight":0.454562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.421846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Oxford","weight":0.36274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.347851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.331956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.279776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.213163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"June 15","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_15"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"William Harvey","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Court","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"},{"name":"Public opinion","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Monarch","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch"},{"name":"January 22","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_22"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"1628","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1628"},{"name":"1656","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1656"},{"name":"1667","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1667"},{"name":"1668","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1668"},{"name":"1678","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1678"},{"name":"Christopher Wren","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren"},{"name":"Spring (hydrosphere)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)"},{"name":"Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_dynasty_of_Egypt"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"}]}
