{"id":90853,"title":"High-volume image-guided injection for recalcitrant medial collateral ligament injuries of the knee.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel injection technique in the management of recalcitrant medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries of the knee.The injection, comprising 10 ml local anaesthetic with 25-50 mg hydrocortisone, is directed beneath the periosteal attachment of the MCL. Twenty-eight patients who received the intervention were asked to complete a questionnaire, a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form to quantify symptoms pre-injection and at follow-up. Data were assessed using descriptive statistics. Further analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Fisher's exact test.Sixty-eight percent (n = 19) of patients responded. Three patients were excluded according to the exclusion criteria. Of those studied, 37.5% (n = 6) were professional athletes. At follow-up, patients reported a mean improvement on the VAS of 75.5% (SD = 23.6). There was a significant improvement in IKDC scores (mean difference 42%, SD = 14.2) pre- and post-injection (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.001). No residual symptoms were reported by 50% (n = 8) of patients, and a further 37.5% (n = 6) of patients had improved. Of those patients who played sport, two-thirds (n = 10) had returned to their previous level of sport at follow-up, including all of the professional athletes.Periosteal high-volume image-guided injection is a useful treatment for recalcitrant MCL injury. Results are encouraging, particularly amongst the professional athletes studied.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568783","annotations":[{"name":"Injury","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.284045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.239066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.204829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.0985155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Medial collateral ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Local anesthetic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Professional sports","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Recalcitrant seed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recalcitrant_seed"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
