{"id":12015,"title":"Influence of CD8 T cell priming in liver and gut on the enterohepatic circulation.","abstract":"The enterohepatic circuit of T cells may be responsible for the development of autoimmune liver disease. We employed transgenic mice to characterize phenotype and migration patterns of CD8 T cells activated in liver and gut.We studied the migration of antigen-specific CD8 T cells primed in liver or gut after transfer in wild-type mice or mice that express ovalbumin in liver or gut. We performed transcriptome analysis of these two distinct T cell populations and confirmed our findings by flow cytometry.Specific migration patterns were induced by activation of CD8 T cells in gut or liver. Gut-activated CD8 T cells expressed ?4?7 and CCR9 and migrated to the gut and to the liver. Liver-activated T cells expressed integrins ?4, ?6, ?1, ?4?7 as well as CD62L, Ly6C, and neuropilin-1 and retained the capability to re-circulate through lymph nodes. Presence of the antigen increased retention of both types of activated T cells in the liver, but migration of liver-activated T cells to the gut was prohibited.CD8 T cells primed in the liver in vivo are not capable of migrating to the gut, implying that the enterohepatic circuit of CD8 T cells is in fact a one-way road from the gut to the liver. Priming of CD8 T cells in the liver results in a distinct phenotype with attributes of central memory cells and induces a unique homing pattern. Gut-primed T cells preferentially home to the liver, in principle enabling them to induce autoimmune liver disease.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560659","annotations":[{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.81888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.78153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.696422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.637738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.62981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.568419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.534824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.369971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.369513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.298804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Autoimmune hepatitis","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.224121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"L-selectin","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-selectin"},{"name":"Neuropilin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropilin"},{"name":"Enterohepatic circulation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterohepatic_circulation"},{"name":"CC chemokine receptors","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.0215599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Light-year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year"},{"name":"Memory B cell","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Emigration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"}]}
