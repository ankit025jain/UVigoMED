{"id":16784,"title":"The angiotensin II type 2 receptor for pain control.","abstract":"All well-known deleterious effects of angiotensin (Ang) II, including vasoconstriction, inflammation, water and salt retention, and vascular remodeling, are mediated via its type 1 (AT1) receptor. This explains why AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and inhibitors of Ang II synthesis, such as ACE inhibitors and renin inhibitors, are beneficial for cardiovascular disease. Yet, Ang II has a second receptor, the Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor, the function of which, even after over 20 years of research, remains largely unknown. In this issue, Marion etÂ al. provide a new chapter to the AT2 receptor story.
