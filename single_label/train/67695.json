{"id":67695,"title":"Tobramycin exposure from active calcium sulfate bone graft substitute.","abstract":"Bone graft substitute such as calcium sulfate are frequently used as carrier material for local antimicrobial therapy in orthopedic surgery. This study aimed to assess the systemic absorption and disposition of tobramycin in patients treated with a tobramycin-laden bone graft substitute (Osteoset® T).The patients were 52 +/- 20 years old, their mean body weight was 73 +/- 17 kg and their mean CLCr was 119 +/- 55 mL/min. Either 10 g or 20 g Osteoset® T with 4% tobramycin sulfate was implanted in various sites. Concentration profiles remained low and consistent with absorption rate-limited first-order release, while showing important variability. With CL equated to CLCr, mean absorption rate constant (ka) was 0.06 h-1, F was 63% or 32% (CV 74%) for 10 and 20 g Osteoset® T respectively, and volume of distribution (V) was 16.6 L (CV 89%). Simulations predicted sustained high, potentially toxic concentrations with 10 g, 30 g and 50 g Osteoset® T for CLCr values below 10, 20 and 30 mL/min, respectively.Osteoset® T does not raise toxicity concerns in subjects without significant renal failure. The risk/benefit ratio might turn unfavorable in case of severe renal failure, even after standard dose implantation.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593819","annotations":[{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.825654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Calcium sulfate","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_sulfate"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.740171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.468822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.343787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.316615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.299516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.266957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.248197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Volume of distribution","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_distribution"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Tobramycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobramycin"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
