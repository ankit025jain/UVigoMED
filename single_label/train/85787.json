The biological behavior of lung tumor cells can be reversed by inhibiting the expression of NF-?Bp65 directly or indirectly. Nuclear factor-?Bp65 gene shRNA recombinant plasmids were constructed and then infected with A549 cells. New stable cell lines were selected, and the ability of migration and adhesion was identified.Both scramble control sequence and interference sequence (shRNA) of human nuclear factor-?Bp65 were designed and synthesized to build recombinant plasmids, with BamH I site at the 5' end and Xho I and EcoR I sites at the 3' end. A549 cells were infected, and stable transfection strains were selected by puromycin. Western blot and qRT-PCR methods were applied to assess the interference efficient of NF-?Bp65 and the protein expression level of I?B?. Transwell and MTT assays were carried out to analyze the ability of migration and adhesion of A549 cells separately.Recombinant plasmids were successfully built, and A549/NF-?B p65 scramble and A549/NF-?B p65 shRNA stable transfection strains were also successfully screened. Both mRNA and protein expression levels of NF-?Bp65 showed that A549/NF-?Bp65 shRNA cells decreased compared with A549/NF-?B p65 scramble cells and A549 cells, whereas the protein level of I?B? significantly increased. Both migration and adhesion abilities were also reduced.In this study, both mRNA and protein expression levels of NF-?Bp65 were effectively suppressed by RNA interference technique. NF-?Bp65 inhibition can significantly reduce the migration and adhesion ability of A549 cells.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854553","annotations":[{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.704271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.688541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.637074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.584946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.453973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.377896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.35839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.213223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Puromycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puromycin"},{"name":"Small hairpin RNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hairpin_RNA"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
