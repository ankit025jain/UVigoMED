{"id":35613,"title":"\"Taking its toll\": the challenges of working in fetal medicine.","abstract":"Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals' interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects.In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis.Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover.This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635425","annotations":[{"name":"Australia","weight":0.809429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.771872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.512671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Melbourne","weight":0.472764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.416718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.334498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Burnout (psychology)","weight":0.281045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_(psychology)"},{"name":"Allied health professions","weight":0.16486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_health_professions"},{"name":"Dream","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Compassion","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Empirical research","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research"},{"name":"Human genetic engineering","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Allies of World War II","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II"},{"name":"Revenue","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue"},{"name":"Turnover (employment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(employment)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Literary criticism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism"},{"name":"Tariff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Maternal-fetal medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal-fetal_medicine"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"}]}
