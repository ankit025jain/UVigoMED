{"id":82839,"title":"Incidence and prevalence of dental-periodontal conditions and edentation in Moldavia.","abstract":"The proper rehabilitation of the partially extended edentulous patient should lead to a state of balance between the components of the stomatognathic system and the therapeutic option selected for an as long as possible.To outline the importance of a holistic biological perspective on the body-stomatognathic system relationships and the need for complex rehabilitation in view of obtaining a long lasting balance.3340 individuals from urban and rural areas of Iasi County were evaluated. The evaluation was based on the correlation of physical exam with data from a specially drafted questionnaire aimed at determining oral health behavior pattern, a sine-qua-non condition for a clear identification of oral conditions specific to the study area.General health status was poor in 72.1% of the subjects from rural areas as compared to 27.9% in those from rural areas, with cardiovascular diseases ranking first but with higher rates in urban than in rural areas. In urban areas, odontal lesions were the most common and had a higher prevalence in 2012 than in the previous years, followed by the periodontal lesions with the same ascending trend in 2012.Continuity with regard to the prophylaxis of general and oral conditions in the lasi County in both rural and urban areas is a must, health education being essential for improving population health.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505916","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Holism","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Population health","weight":0.411622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.373195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.261839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.228444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.204947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Moldavia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavia"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Conscription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
