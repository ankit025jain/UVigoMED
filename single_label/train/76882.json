{"id":76882,"title":"A survey of self-reported management of hypernatraemia acquired in Australasian intensive care units.","abstract":"To examine self-reported treatment preferences among Australasian consultant intensivists for intensive care-acquired hypernatraemia (IAH).We used a web-based survey with 10 questions about the management of IAH.We measured number of respondents and response rate, IAH treatment methods, thresholds and the reasons for these.There were 156 survey respondents, of whom 137 were consultant intensivists, representing a response rate of 31%. Ninety-three percent of responding clinicians (95% CI, 87%-96%) used intravenous fluid (49%; 95% CI, 40%-57%) or enteral nutrition changes (44%; 95% CI, 36%-53%) as their first choice of treatment. As alternative therapies, respondents reported using thiazides (22%; 95% CI, 16%-30%), aldosterone antagonists (20%; 95% CI, 14%-28%) and renal replacement therapy (14%; 95% CI, 9%-21%) less commonly.There is a wide variety of treatments in use for IAH. Most clinicians initiate treatment at a level greater than the level that is independently associated with increased mortality in the literature.1 Initial treatment is equally divided between changes in intravenous fluid and changes in enteral nutrition.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888289","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.569068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aldosterone","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone"},{"name":"Nasogastric intubation","weight":0.43295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation"},{"name":"Hypernatremia","weight":0.415777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypernatremia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.412277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.331171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.223991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.173197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Thiazide","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazide"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Aldosterone antagonist","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone_antagonist"},{"name":"Intravenous fluid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_fluid"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"1630","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1630"},{"name":"921","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/921"},{"name":"1428","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1428"},{"name":"Web application","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Australasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"George Bush Intercontinental Airport","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush_Intercontinental_Airport"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
