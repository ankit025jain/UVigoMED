{"id":47514,"title":"Proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibits the proliferation and promotes the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.","abstract":"Comprehensive treatment based on chemotherapy is regarded as the first-line treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, chemoresistance is common among patients with ESCC. Therefore, there is a need to explore new therapeutic strategies or adjuvant drugs. One promising possibility is to use dietary agents that can increase tumor cell sensitivity to drugs. In this study, we initially investigated the antitumor activity of proteasome inhibitor MG132 in vitro and in vivo. Effects of MG132 on the enhancment of the anticancer functions of cisplatin were then investigated in human esophageal cancer EC9706 cells in relation to apoptosis and cell signaling events. Exposure of cells to MG132 resulted in a marked decrease in cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Administration of MG132 markedly inhibited tumor growth in the EC9706 xenograft model. MG132 significantly enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in association with the activation of caspase-3 and -8. These events were accompanied by the downregulation of NF-?B, which plays a key role in cell apoptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which proteasome inhibitor MG132 potentiates cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human ESCC and inhibitory activity of tumor growth of the EC9706 xenograft model.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584782","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.874172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.792177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.791478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.747075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.745269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.67264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.653499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.631229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.542751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.542247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.209069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.186427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Proteasome inhibitor","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
