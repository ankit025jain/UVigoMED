{"id":89910,"title":"How long should we treat?","abstract":"Osteoporosis is a chronic disease, for which effective drugs are available. These drugs have reduced the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures in robust trials of 3-5 years duration. There is no evidence of anti-fracture efficacy for treatments of longer duration. The consequences of stopping treatments are very different for the different molecules. Bisphosphonates can be safely discontinued after 3-5 years of treatment if there was optimal adherence and if patients are no longer osteoporotic. This discontinuation cannot be applied in patients with recent fractures or for other treatments. Safety of prolonged treatment is a huge concern which must be managed appropriately. The decision of a prolonged treatment is driven by the underlying risk of fracture. This risk must be assessed regularly in order to share with the patient the benefit-risk ratio of prolonged treatment.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668004","annotations":[{"name":"Drug","weight":0.858052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.433824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.369419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.368144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.175328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.093553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
