{"id":62658,"title":"Does dexamethasone induce more neuropsychological side effects than prednisone in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia? A systematic review.","abstract":"Steroid-induced neuropsychological side effects impact quality of life in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Dexamethasone induces more metabolic side effects than prednisone. To evaluate whether dexamethasone also leads to more neuropsychological side effects, we reviewed all available literature. Randomized controlled trials with neuropsychological function as the primary or secondary outcome did not show clinically meaningful differences between dexamethasone and prednisone on cognition, mood or behavior.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532490","annotations":[{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.699598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.555703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0236217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"}]}
