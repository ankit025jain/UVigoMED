{"id":28246,"title":"[The analysis of the polymorphic variations of the dopamine gen transporter (DAT1) and the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) in patients with alcohol dependence syndrome with inclusion of the phenotypic feature of sweet liking preference].","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between sweet-liking phenotype and the variation of the gene sequence of the dopaminergic and serotonergic system.The study recruited 100 probands. The participants were interviewed for addiction (SSAGA-Semi Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism) and assessed with the questionnaires: MMSE, Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Anxiety, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. The taste was analyzed with tests to assess sensitivity to sweet taste and also smell tests were performed. Patients preferring the highest glucose volumes were called sweet likers. Statistical analyses were performed (SPSS- Statistical Package for the Social Sciences).Links between sweet liking phenotype and polymorphic variant of DAT1 gene were determined. The presence of DAT1 9/10 genotype increased three fold time sweet liking phenotype (p = 0.015, odds ratio-3.00), the presence of DAT1 10/10 decreased two fold time the chance being sweet liker (p = 0.051, odds ratio-0.43). Genotype 10/10 was significantly more common among sweet dislikers 10/10 (68.18% vs 47.92%) i 9/9 (6.82% vs 2.08%). CONCLUSIONS; A genetically significant association between the presence of 9/10 DAT1 VNTR genotype and a sweet-liking phenotype in probands was determined.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946437","annotations":[{"name":"Serotonin transporter","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_transporter"},{"name":"Serotonergic","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonergic"},{"name":"Variable number tandem repeat","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_number_tandem_repeat"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.76892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.689702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.663999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.549947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.541068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.418093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Dopamine transporter","weight":0.373857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_transporter"},{"name":"Olfaction","weight":0.201489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.0524831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Beck Depression Inventory","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_Depression_Inventory"},{"name":"Pleasure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
