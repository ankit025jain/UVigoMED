{"id":24378,"title":"Shifts towards pediatric specialists in the treatment of appendicitis and pyloric stenosis: trends and outcomes.","abstract":"Little data exists on temporal changes in the care of children with common surgical conditions. We hypothesized that an increasing proportion of procedures are performed at pediatric hospitals over time, and that outcomes are superior at these centers.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Washington State discharge records for children 0-17years old undergoing appendectomy (n=39,472) or pyloromyotomy (n=3,500). Pediatric hospitals were defined as centers with full-time pediatric surgeons. Outcomes were examined for two time periods (1987-2000, 2001-2009).From 1987 to 2009, the proportion of procedures performed at pediatric hospitals steadily increased. The percentage for appendectomies increased from 17% to 32%, and that for pyloromyotomies increased from 57% to 99%. For pyloromyotomy, care at a pediatric hospital was associated with decreased risk of postoperative complications (OR=0.36, p<0.001) for both time periods. Appendectomy outcomes did not differ significantly in the early time period, but in the later time period specialist care was associated with lower risk of complications in children <5years (OR=0.54, p=0.03).There has been a shift towards pediatric hospitals for certain procedures, with a widening disparity in outcomes for younger children. These results suggest that procedures in younger patients may best be performed by providers familiar with these patient populations.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439595","annotations":[{"name":"Appendicitis","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.564681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.557549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Children's hospital","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_hospital"},{"name":"Appendectomy","weight":0.267241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy"},{"name":"Pyloric stenosis","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyloric_stenosis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Pyloromyotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyloromyotomy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"1987","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Pylorus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"}]}
