{"id":44769,"title":"Plasma membrane phospholipase A2 controls hepatocellular fatty acid uptake and is responsive to pharmacological modulation: implications for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.","abstract":"Excess hepatic fat accumulation leads to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a serious threat to health for which no effective treatment is available. However, the mechanism responsible for fatty acid uptake by hepatocytes remains unclear. Using the human hepatocyte-derived tumor cell line HepG2, we found that fatty acid influx is mediated by a heterotetrameric plasma membrane protein complex consisting of plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein, caveolin-1, CD36, and calcium-independent membrane phospholipase A2 (iPLA2?). Blocking iPLA2? with the bile acid-phospholipid conjugate ursodeoxycholate-lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) caused the dissociation of the complex, thereby inhibiting fatty acid influx (IC50 47 ?M), and suppressed the synthesis of all subunits through a reduction in lysophosphatidylcholine from 8.0 to 3.5 ?mol/mg of protein and corresponding depletion of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These findings were substantiated by an observed 56.5% decrease in fatty acid influx in isolated hepatocytes derived from iPLA2?-knockout mice. Moreover, steatosis and inflammation were abrogated by UDCA-LPE treatment in a cellular model of NASH. Thus, iPLA2? acts as an upstream checkpoint for mechanisms that regulate fatty acid uptake, and its inhibition by UDCA-LPE qualifies this nontoxic compound as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH.-Stremmel, W., Staffer, S., Wannhoff, A., Pathil, A., Chamulitrat, W.
