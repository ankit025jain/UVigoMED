{"id":42768,"title":"Lower life expectancy among people with an HCV notification: a population-based linkage study.","abstract":"Among people with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, liver disease-related deaths have risen over the last 20 years. Life expectancy has not been estimated in this population. HCV notifications (mandatory notification of anti-HCV-positive serology since 1991) reported to the New South Wales Health Department from 1992 to 2006 were linked to cause of death data. Abridged life tables were constructed from age-specific mortality rates. Life expectancy from ages 18-70 years for non-drug-related mortality causes was estimated using competing risk methods and compared to the general population of Australia. The cohort comprised 81 644 individuals with an HCV notification, with median follow-up of 7.6 years. Median age at notification was 34 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28-42] and 63% were male. Between 1992 and 2006, 4607 deaths occurred. Median age at liver- and drug-related death among males was 51 (IQR 45-66) and 36 (IQR 31-42) years, respectively, and among females was 63 (IQR 49-74) and 36 (IQR 30-41) years, respectively. In each year of follow-up before 2000, 15-21% of deaths were liver- and 30-39% were drug-related. After 2000, liver-related deaths increased to 20-26% of deaths in each year and drug-related deaths decreased to 13-19%. Excluding drug-related causes of death, life expectancy was lowered by an average of 4.2 (SD ± 1.0) and 5.4 (SD ± 0.7) years for males and females, respectively. Among people with an HCV notification, an increasing proportion of deaths are liver-related. Following removal of drug-related mortality, life expectancy in this population remained considerably lower, compared with the general population.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827903","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.738828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.63343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.61914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.533237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.46481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"New South Wales","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"},{"name":"Life table","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Wales","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1992","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992"},{"name":"1991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991"},{"name":"1870","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1870"},{"name":"1521","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1521"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"644","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/644"},{"name":"1319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1319"},{"name":"2026","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Health department","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department"},{"name":"Notification system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notification_system"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"South Wales","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales"}]}
