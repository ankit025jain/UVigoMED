{"id":31266,"title":"Design and methods of a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of extended-release naltrexone for alcohol dependent and hazardous drinking prisoners with HIV who are transitioning to the community.","abstract":"HIV-infected prisoners have a high prevalence of alcohol use disorders and commonly relapse to alcohol soon after release to the community which is linked to high morbidity, poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and increased sexual risk-taking behaviors. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) effectively reduces relapse to alcohol in alcohol dependent persons, yet it remains unexamined among criminal justice system (CJS) populations transitioning to the community.A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of XR-NTX to improve HIV treatment outcomes via reducing relapse to alcohol use after prison release for HIV-infected hazardous drinking and alcohol dependent prisoners is discussed.Acceptability of study participation is high with 86% of those referred who met eligibility criteria and 85% of those who were able to receive injections prior to release accepted injections, yet important implementation issues are identified and addressed during the study and are discussed in this paper.Medication-assisted therapies for prevention of relapse to alcohol use for CJS populations transitioning to the community, especially for HIV-infected patients, are urgently needed in order to reduce alcohol relapse after release and improve HIV treatment outcomes and contribute to improved individual and public health.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24384538","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.653807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.62712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.553926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.540631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.536861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.530041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Criminal justice","weight":0.515893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.389409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Prison","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.0722042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Justice","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Naltrexone","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Transgender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender"},{"name":"List of country legal systems","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_legal_systems"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"}]}
