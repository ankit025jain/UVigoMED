{"id":65707,"title":"Impacts of ICAM-1 gene polymorphisms on urothelial cell carcinoma susceptibility and clinicopathologic characteristics in Taiwan.","abstract":"Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, a cell adhesion molecule, is reportedly overexpressed in several cancers and may contribute to tumorgenesis and metastasis. The current study explored the effect of ICAM-1 gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility of developing urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) and the clinicopathological status. A total of 558 participants, including 279 healthy people and 279 patients with UCC, were recruited for this study. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the ICAM-1 gene were assessed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction with the TaqMan assay. After adjusting for other covariants, the individuals carrying at least one G allele at ICAM-1 rs5498 had a 1.603-fold risk of developing UCC than did wild-type (AA) carriers. Furthermore, UCC patients who carried at least one G allele at rs5498 had a higher invasive stage risk (p?<?0.05) than did patients carrying the wild-type allele. In conclusion, the rs5498 polymorphic genotypes of ICAM-1 might contribute to the prediction of susceptibility to and pathological development of UCC. This is the first study to provide insight into risk factors associated with ICAM-1 variants in carcinogenesis of UCC in Taiwan.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789429","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.795511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.737113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.691276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.682385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.678432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.354078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.302191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
