{"id":65856,"title":"Obesity and long-term survival after radical prostatectomy.","abstract":"Obesity is a modifiable risk factor associated with worse outcomes for many cancers, yet implications for prostate cancer are not well understood. Notably the impact of body mass index on long-term survival after treatment is unclear. We performed a retrospective cohort study on a large series of men who underwent radical prostatectomy to assess the impact of obesity on long-term biochemical recurrence-free survival, prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival.Between 1982 and 2012, 11,152 men underwent radical prostatectomy at a single tertiary referral center. Patients were stratified according to body mass index as normal weight (body mass index less than 25 kg/m(2)), overweight (body mass index 25 to less than 30 kg/m(2)), mild obesity (body mass index 30 to less than 35 kg/m(2)) and moderate/severe obesity (body mass index 35 kg/m(2) or greater), comprising 27.6%, 56.0%, 14.1% and 2.3% of the cohort, respectively. Covariates included age, preoperative prostate specific antigen, surgery year, Gleason score, pathological stage, surgical margin and race. Predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival, prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival were identified using Cox proportional hazard models.Median followup was 5 years (range 1 to 27). Actuarial 20-year biochemical recurrence-free survival for mild and moderate/severe obesity was 65% and 51%, respectively, compared to 76% for normal weight men (p ?0.001). In a multivariate model obesity was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival (mild HR 1.30, p = 0.002; moderate/severe HR 1.45, p = 0.028) and overall survival (mild HR 1.41, p = 0.003; moderate/severe HR 1.81, p = 0.033). However, only mild obesity was significantly associated with prostate cancer specific survival (HR 1.51, p = 0.040), whereas moderate/severe obesity was not (HR 1.58, p = 0.356).Obese men have higher rates of biochemical recurrence than normal weight patients during long-term followup. Obesity at the time of surgery independently predicts overall survival and biochemical recurrence-free survival but not prostate cancer specific survival.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769031","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.881779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.81544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.719817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.608877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.58136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.510685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Surgical margin","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_margin"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.426053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.394998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.150053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
