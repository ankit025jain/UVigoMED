{"id":61692,"title":"Functions and diseases of red and white blood cells.","abstract":"Red and white blood cells have two main functions: the carriage of oxygen; and defence against microbial attack. The full blood count is one of the most frequently requested routine blood tests; it provides key indices such as haemoglobin and the number of white cell subsets, and provides information to aid diagnosis of a range of conditions, including anaemia, infection, leukaemia, myeloma and lymphoma.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683693","annotations":[{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.85672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.815977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
