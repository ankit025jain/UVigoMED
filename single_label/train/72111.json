{"id":72111,"title":"Earlier and sustained response with incidental use of cardiovascular drugs among patients with low- to medium-grade meningiomas treated with radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT).","abstract":"Beneficial outcome for cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT) and ?-blockers has been reported. We hypothesize a potential combined impact of stereotactic RT with incidental use of cardiovascular drugs also in meningiomas.In 64 patients with 70 intracranial meningiomas (male/female=17/53; median follow-up=2 years) from a prospective database with sustained RT/cardiovascular drug therapy tumor response (progression, stable disease, regression) was evaluated at predefined follow-up intervals of 3, 12 and 24 months based on MR-imaging. For this retrospective cohort analysis stepwise univariate and multivariate analyses for group comparison were performed. Between groups analysis and stepwise uni- and multivariate analysis was performed.At one year follow-up there was a significant better tumor response for patients with antihypertensives use (p=0.008) and radiosurgery (SRS) (p=0.054), the difference between patients with and without antihypertensive medication remains significant in multivariate analysis. Two years after RT, only patients with ?-blocker use had a significant better response to RT (p=0.032). Additionally, for the use of ?-blockers a trend toward significance for early tumor response at 3 months compared to the control group was observed (p(one tailed)=0.059).Our data suggest that concomitant antihypertensive medication (especially ?-blockers) may lead to an earlier and sustained response in stereotactic irradiated low- to medium-grade intracranial meningiomas by affecting the ?-adrenergic pathways.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998705","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.796984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.780698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Radiosurgery","weight":0.698987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.634747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Meningioma","weight":0.405553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningioma"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.313988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.153714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
