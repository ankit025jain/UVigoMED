{"id":15222,"title":"Reconstructive surgery in children to correct ulnar claw hand deformity due to leprosy.","abstract":"To study the impact of tendon transfer surgery for ulnar claw hand correction in children with leprosy.All the children who underwent reconstructive surgery for ulnar nerve paralysis during the period 2007 to 2012 were included in the study. Unassisted angle, grasp contact, pinch contact and functional assessment were the main outcome measures. All the surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon and pre- and post-operative therapy protocol was same for all the patients. A common surgical audit form was used to record assessments for all the patients.In this case series, 82 hands of 79 patients with ulnar paralysis were included. All the children had lasso surgery. In 83% of hands, flexor digitorum superficialis of middle or ringer finger was used, while in the remaining patients palmaris longus or extensor carpi radialis longus with fascia lata graft was used as the motor tendon. The unassisted angle decreased in all the patients, indicating correction of claw fingers. Hand function improved after surgery and it showed steady progress during follow-up.The deformity due to leprosy in the hands of children is a tragedy as it hampers the use of hands in daily routine activities, school work and other social interactions. Tendon transfer surgery should be done on children to correct established clawed fingers as it yields good results and helps in facilitating hand function to complete daily activities and lead a normal life.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255610","annotations":[{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Palmaris longus muscle","weight":0.783482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmaris_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.763079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Flexor digitorum superficialis muscle","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_digitorum_superficialis_muscle"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle","weight":0.666478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_carpi_radialis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.589761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Fascia lata","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia_lata"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.414615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.323266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.295179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.0831872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Lasso","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso"},{"name":"Ulnar claw","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_claw"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Claw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Schoolwork","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolwork"},{"name":"List of sports idioms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_idioms"},{"name":"Yield (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(wine)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Tragedy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
