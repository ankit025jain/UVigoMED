{"id":71100,"title":"MicroRNAs and head and neck cancer: reviewing the first decade of research.","abstract":"MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding RNA which regulate gene expression. Their discovery in humans in 2000 has led to an explosion in research in this area in terms of their role as a biomarker, therapeutic target as well as trying to elucidate their function. This review aims to summarise the function of microRNAs as well as to examine how dysregulation at any step in their biogenesis or functional pathway can play a role in the development of cancer. We review which microRNAs are implicated as oncogenic or tumour suppressor in head and neck cancer as well as the data available on the use of microRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic marker. We also discuss routes for future research.
