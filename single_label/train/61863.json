{"id":61863,"title":"Capsaicin induced apoptosis and gene expression dysregulation of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM cells.","abstract":"Capsaicin, an ingredient of red chili pepper, has possible tumorigenicity/genotoxicity properties. We aimed to determine the effects of capsaicin on the proliferation and gene expression profiles of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) CCRF-CEM cell line.Cell viability and IC50 dose was determined by WST cytotoxicity assay. qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining and western blot methods were used to determine target genes' expression levels. Apoptosis was evaluated by measuring the caspase-3 activity.Capsaicin inhibited the proliferation of CCRFCEM cells in a dose-dependent manner. Increased mRNA expressions of caspase gene family members, activated caspase-3 and decreased mRNA and protein expression of BCL-2 gene indicated apoptotic response to capsaicin. Moreover capsaicin treatment suppressed significantly the expression of the key cell signaling pathways of KRAS, AKT, GAB2, PTPN11, BRAF, INPP5D, MAPK7.Capsaicin induces apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells and this response is associated with downregulation of cell signaling pathways.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
