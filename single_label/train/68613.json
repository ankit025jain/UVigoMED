{"id":68613,"title":"Symptomatic treatment and management of multiple sclerosis.","abstract":"The range of symptoms which occur in multiple sclerosis (MS) can have disabling functional consequences for patients and lead to significant reductions in their quality of life. MS symptoms can also interact with each other, making their management challenging. Clinical trials aimed at identifying symptomatic therapies have generally been poorly designed and have tended to be underpowered. Therefore, the evidence base for the management of MS symptoms with pharmacologic therapies is not strong and tends to rely upon open-label studies, case reports, and clinical trials with small numbers of patients and poorly validated clinical outcome measures. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the management of MS symptoms with pharmacologic treatments, and better-designed, randomized, double-blind, controlled trials have been reported. This chapter will describe the evidence base predominantly behind the various pharmacologic approaches to the management of MS symptoms, which in most, if not all, cases, requires multidisciplinary input. Drugs routinely recommended for individual symptoms and new therapies, which are currently in the development pipeline, will be reviewed. More interventional therapies related to symptoms that are refractory to pharmacotherapy will also be discussed, where relevant.
