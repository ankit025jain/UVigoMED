{"id":90910,"title":"High incidence of intraoperative anchorage failure in FasT-fix all inside meniscal suturing device.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of intraoperative failure of the FasT-fix (Smith & Nephew, Andover, USA) device for all-inside meniscal repair and to investigate any underlying factors. Searching retrospectively the hospital databases and patient files, we collected 78 cases, totalling 61 successes and 17 failures. Of a total of 190 FasT-fix anchors, 22 failed (a calculated incidence of 11.6%), either by anchorage slippage through the capsule during tightening or by failure of anchor deployment.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563975","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Andover, Massachusetts","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andover,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Anchor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor"},{"name":"Computer file","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Slippage (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippage_(finance)"},{"name":"Nephew (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephew_(band)"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anchorage, Alaska","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska"}]}
