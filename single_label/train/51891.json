{"id":51891,"title":"Vibrational spectroscopy of biofluids for disease screening or diagnosis: translation from the laboratory to a clinical setting.","abstract":"There remains a need for objective and cost-effective approaches capable of diagnosing early-stage disease in point-of-care clinical settings. Given an increasingly ageing population resulting in a rising prevalence of chronic diseases, the need for screening to facilitate the personalising of therapies to prevent or slow down pathology development will increase. Such a tool needs to be robust but simple enough to be implemented into clinical practice. There is interest in extracting biomarkers from biofluids (e.g., plasma or serum); techniques based on vibrational spectroscopy provide an option. Sample preparation is minimal, techniques involved are relatively low-cost, and data frameworks are available. This review explores the evidence supporting the applicability of vibrational spectroscopy to generate spectral biomarkers of disease in biofluids. We extend the inter-disciplinary nature of this approach to hypothesise a microfluidic platform that could allow such measurements. With an appropriate lightsource, such engineering could revolutionize screening in the 21(st) century.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648213","annotations":[{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.682719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.648965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.510982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.470744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.266739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.135148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.125146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Microfluidics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"Data mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
