{"id":41257,"title":"Assessment of health-related quality of life in antiviral-treated Taiwanese chronic hepatitis C patients using SF-36 and CLDQ.","abstract":"Interferon (IFN) therapy can cause significant side effects in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients; however, the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of antiviral-treated CHC patients has not been established in Taiwan. This study evaluated domains and the degree to which antiviral treatment affects the HRQOL in CHC patients and identifies factors associated with variations between patients.Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) in 108 antiviral-treated CHC patients. Eight scales and two summary scales of the SF-36 were compared with 256 age- and gender-matched population norms and 64 age- and gender-matched CHC patients without antiviral therapy. Descriptive statistic measures, one-way ANOVA, and regression analysis were used for data analysis.(1) CHC patients receiving antiviral treatment displayed significantly lower scores in six scales, the Physical Component Summary (PCS), and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the SF-36, when compared to the population norms and patients without antiviral therapy (p?<?0.05). (2) The mean CLDQ score of antiviral-treated patients was lower than that of patients without antiviral therapy, including subscales of 'fatigue', 'systemic symptoms', and 'role emotion'. (3) All SF-36 subscales significantly correlated with all CLDQ subscales, with the greatest correlation coefficients shown between fatigue and vitality and mental health of SF-36. (4) Antiviral therapy had a greater negative impact on females in the CLDQ, on all patients during treatment weeks 9-16 in the PCS and on patients with a monthly income of less than NT$10,000 in the CLDQ, PCS, and MCS.This study highlighted impairments in the quality of life of chronic hepatitis C patients treated with IFN-based therapy. The significant factors associated with HRQOL include gender, income, and treatment duration. The results of this study might provide nurses with a comprehensive understanding of HRQOL and its determining factors in antiviral-treated CHC patients. The findings can serve as a useful reference for nursing personnel in developing instructions for upgrading the care of CHC patients.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941994","annotations":[{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.832085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.75673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.739852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.70518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.325721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.236379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.219606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.0297571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"New Testament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Vitality","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
