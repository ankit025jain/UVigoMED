{"id":78538,"title":"Identification of a novel 5' alternative CFTR mRNA isoform in a patient with nasal polyposis and CFTR mutations.","abstract":"Cystic fibrosis may be revealed by nasal polyposis (NP) starting early in life. We performed cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) DNA and mRNA analyses in the family of a 12-year-old boy presenting with NP and a normal sweat test. Routine DNA analysis only showed the heterozygous c.2551C>T (p.Arg851*) mutation in the child and the father. mRNA analysis showed partial exon skipping due to c.2551C>T and a significant increase in total CFTR mRNA in the patient and the mother, which was attributable to the heterozygous c. -2954G>A variant in the distant promoter region, as demonstrated by in vitro luciferase assays. The 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis showed the presence of a novel transcript, where the canonical exon 1 was replaced by an alternative exon called 1a-Long. This case report could represent the first description of a CFTR-related disorder associated with the presence of a 5' alternative, probably nonfunctional transcript, similar to those of fetal origin.
