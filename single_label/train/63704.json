{"id":63704,"title":"Immune cell subset counts associated with graft-versus-host disease.","abstract":"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major transplantation complication. The purpose of this study was to measure immune cell subsets by flow cytometry early after transplantation (before median day of GVHD onset) to identify subsets that may play a role in GVHD pathogenesis. We also measured the subsets later after transplantation to determine which subsets may be influenced by GVHD or its treatment. We studied 219 patients. We found that acute GVHD (aGVHD) was preceded by high counts of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells. It was followed by low counts of total and naive B cells, total and cytolytic NK cells, and myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was preceded by low counts of memory B cells. In conclusion, both CD4 and CD8 T cells appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of aGVHD. Generation of B cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells may be hampered by aGVHD and/or its treatment. Memory B cells may inhibit the development of cGVHD.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406506","annotations":[{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.716845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.672147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Memory B cell","weight":0.447015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"},{"name":"Cytolysis","weight":0.432491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytolysis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
