{"id":89721,"title":"[Falls mortality trends in México, 1979-2010].","abstract":"To analyze the mortality trend by accidental falls in Mexico, from 1979 to 2010.We used official mortality data in México. Variables included were mortality cause, place of lesion, age, sex, year of mortality registration, size of the town of occurrence, state, occupation, workplace falls.During that period, 124,509 deaths by accidental and intentional falls were registered; of these 77.03% were men. From 1989 (3.20 per 100,000) to 2010 (1.99 per 100,000), the mortality trend was falling (? = -0.053/ 100,000, p ? 0.001). In the majority of states, we found a decreased between 1993-1997 and 2006 to 2010, except in Aguascalientes, Puebla, Baja California Sur, Durango and Nuevo León.This is the first study in México that showed the descending trend of mortality in accidental falls in the last two decades.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687340","annotations":[{"name":"Baja California","weight":0.822937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California"},{"name":"Puebla","weight":0.705736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.687243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Baja California Sur","weight":0.567372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_Sur"},{"name":"Durango","weight":0.522519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango"},{"name":"Aguascalientes","weight":0.508381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguascalientes"},{"name":"California","weight":0.485808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.287807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"1989","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Military occupation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation"},{"name":"Len (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_(band)"},{"name":"Variable (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 509","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_509"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Vehicle registration plate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Civil registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_registry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
