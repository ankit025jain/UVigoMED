{"id":22007,"title":"Pelvic inflammatory disease in women with endometriosis is more severe than in those without.","abstract":"To determine the incidence and severity of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) in hospitalised women with and without a history of endometriosis.Retrospective analysis of hospital records retrieved for all women hospitalised with PID or TOA between January 2008 and December 2011 in a tertiary referral centre. Women were compared with regard to a history of endometriosis for demographic, clinical and fertility data.26 (15%) of the 174 women hospitalised due to PID or TOA were excluded because of age older than 45 years, leaving 148 for analysis. The mean age was 35.7 ± 9.3 years and mean duration of hospitalisation was 5.9 ± 3.7 days. The women were divided into two groups: Group 1 with endometriosis (n = 21) and Group 2 without endometriosis (n = 127). Women in Group 1 as compared with Group 2 were significantly more likely to have undergone a fertility procedure prior to being admitted to the hospital with PID (9/27 (45%) vs 22/121 (17%), P < 0.001); particularly in vitro fertilisation (IVF) (7/ 27 (33%) vs 12/121 (9%), P < 0.006); Women in Group 1 more frequently experienced a severe and complicated course involving longer duration of hospitalisation (8.8 ± 4.7 vs 4.4 ± 2.3 days, P < 0.0001) and antibiotic treatment failure (10/27 (48%) vs 8/121 (6%), P < 0.0001).Pelvic inflammatory disease in women with endometriosis is more severe and refractory to antibiotic treatment, often requiring surgical intervention. It is likely that endometriosis is a risk factor for the development of severe PID, particularly after IVF treatment.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576163","annotations":[{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.927138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.803461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.772305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.7371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.71795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.688108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.672857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pelvic inflammatory disease","weight":0.522222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_inflammatory_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.445358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.415456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.338178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.331372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.2313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"1027","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1027"},{"name":"927","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/927"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Tertiary sector of the economy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
