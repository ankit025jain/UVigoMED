{"id":4495,"title":"[Immediate complications of endovascular interventions in chronic ischemia of the lower extremity tissues].","abstract":"The results of examination and treatment of 66 patients, suffering occlusion-stenotic affection of the lower extremities arteries, to whom transcutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty was performed, are adduced. Immediate postoperative complications after endovascular interventions have occurred in 4 (6.1%) patients. The immediate complications, causes of their occurrence, methods of treatment, ways of prophylaxis were analyzed. In 50% of patients, suffering complications of endovascular interventions in immediate postoperative period, it is possible to eliminate them, using simple prophylactic measures.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509433","annotations":[{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.731233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.583285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.582755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.559079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.526027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.10799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Transdermal","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Affection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
