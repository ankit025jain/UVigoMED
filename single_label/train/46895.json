{"id":46895,"title":"Subgrouping of intermediate-stage (BCLC stage B) hepatocellular carcinoma based on tumor number and size and Child-Pugh grade correlated with prognosis after transarterial chemoembolization.","abstract":"To find a subgroup that benefits most from transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in terms of tumor number and size and liver profile in patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Data of 325 intermediate-stage HCC patients who received TACE as the initial treatment were gathered. Four tumor numbers (3-6 tumors) and five maximum tumor diameters (3-7 cm) as well as all of their combinations but one (3 tumors and 3 cm) and Child-Pugh grade were used as variables to ascertain prognostic factors.The respective 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates in all patients were 86.5, 47.0, and 23.7%, respectively. Tumor numbers of 4 (P = 0.00145) and 5 (P = 0.036), and tumor size of 7 cm (P = 0.015), and 12 other combinations of tumor number and size, and Child-Pugh grade (P = 0.0015) were identified as significant prognostic factors in univariate analysis, and 4 tumors of 7 cm (P = 0.0008) and Child-Pugh grade (P = 0.0036) remained significant in the stepwise Cox proportional hazard model. The overall survival was significantly better in a patient subgroup having two factors other than patient subgroups having one or no prognostic factors.A patient subgroup having two prognostic factors benefited most from TACE in intermediate-stage HCC patients.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615165","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.468502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.333551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.307159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.212763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0848469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"325","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/325"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Stepwise regression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Subgrouping (linguistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgrouping_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"}]}
