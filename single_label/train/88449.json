{"id":88449,"title":"External validity of a population-based study on osteoporosis and fracture.","abstract":"Little is known about the characteristics of non-participants in epidemiological studies. We evaluated external validity by comparing fracture and mortality rate in participants and non-participants in a longitudinal study on risk factors for fracture.1,604 randomly selected women, 75 years of age, were invited to attend a study on osteoporosis and fracture. 1,044 women attended the study (participants) and 560 women did not participate (non-participants). Fracture data for all were obtained prospectively from radiographic records. Mortality data were obtained through the population register. Mean follow-up was 13 (11-15) years. Cumulative survival was compared with the log-rank test. Fracture incidence rates per 1,000 person-years were compared with Mann-Whitney U-tests. In addition, fracture comparisons were made with the cumulative incidence function and Gray's test.454 participants (44%) died during the follow-up, as compared to 372 of the non-participants (66%) (p < 0.001). The fracture incidence rate for any type of fracture was 43 for participants and 47 for non-participants (p = 1.0). The fracture incidence rate for typical osteoporotic fracture was 36 for participants and 39 for non-participants (p = 0.6). The corresponding values for distal forearm fracture were 11 and 7 (p = 0.002), they were 8 and 9 for proximal humerus fracture (p = 0.9), 13 and 10 for vertebral fracture (p = 0.007), 15 and 18 for hip fracture (p = 0.8), and they were 6 and 5 for pelvic fracture (p = 0.3). The cumulative incidence function confirmed the results.Our findings suggest that participants had a lower mortality rate than non-participants. Distal forearm and vertebral fractures were more frequent in participants. However, the external validity for fractures in general appeared to be satisfactory.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847791","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.762269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.759546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Pelvic fracture","weight":0.730769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_fracture"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.710769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.696986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.692131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.653037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.604945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.547339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.47573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Humerus fracture","weight":0.371491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus_fracture"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.356599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.307184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"External validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Holotype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
