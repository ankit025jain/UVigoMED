{"id":70664,"title":"Biopolymeric alginate-chitosan nanoparticles as drug delivery carriers for cancer therapy.","abstract":"Nanoparticulate drug delivery systems enhance cancer treatment by direct entry of nanometer particles into the fenestration in the vasculature of cancer cells. Nanoparticles for encapsulation of anticancer drugs are preferably prepared using natural polymers as carriers, with polysaccharides being particularly favorable. Alginate and chitosan polysaccharides have been widely used in nanoparticulate drug delivery systems because of their biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic and bioadhesive properties. In this review, we present an overview of drug delivery systems for cancer treatment, describe the use of biopolymeric alginate-chitosan nanoparticles for anticancer drug delivery, and discuss the important characteristics of these nanoparticles for use in drug delivery.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158565","annotations":[{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.784725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.776022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.696404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Alginic acid","weight":0.583299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alginic_acid"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.548381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.359501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.114428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Chitosan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitosan"}]}
