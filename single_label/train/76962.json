{"id":76962,"title":"Hypovitaminosis D in a sunny country: time trends, predictors, and implications for practice guidelines.","abstract":"The aim of the current study is to investigate the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in Lebanese subjects, its robust predictors, evaluate the relationship between 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] and parathyroid hormone levels, and derive desirable vitamin D levels, based on a large hospital laboratory database spanning all age groups. Data from a large representative digitized database of 9147 subjects, mostly outpatients, evaluated between 2000-2004 and 2007-2008, in whom information on age, gender, service, and time of the year, was analyzed. The PTH-25(OH)D relationship was studied in a subset of 657 adult subjects, in whom such data were available. At a 25(OH)D cut-off of<20 ng/ml, the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D ranged between 58% and 62% in pediatric subjects, 44% and 60% in adults, and 41% and 62% in elderly, in the 2 study periods. At a cut-off <30 ng/ml, the prevalence was above 78%, in most sub-groups. Regardless of cut-off used, the only significant predictors of high mean 25(OH)D levels were the male gender in the pediatric group, and female gender in adults and elderly, summer/fall seasons, out-patient status, as well as study period. Curve fitting of the PTH-25(OH)D relationship, in adults and elderly, revealed a plateau at 25(OH)D levels of 17-21 ng/ml, depending on sub-study group. Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent in our sunny country, even using a conservative population-derived cut-off of 20 ng/ml, and thus the need for a public health strategy for supplementation.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874590","annotations":[{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.664119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.563195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.342541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Lebanon","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.241325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.192874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.178079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Medical laboratory","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"}]}
