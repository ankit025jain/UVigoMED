{"id":72110,"title":"High-dose reirradiation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for recurrent head-and-neck cancer: disease control, survival and toxicity.","abstract":"To evaluate disease control, survival and severe late toxicity after high-dose fractionated reirradiation using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for recurrent head-and-neck cancer.Sixty consecutive patients were reirradiated with IMRT between 1997 and 2011. The median prescribed dose was 70 Gy in 35 daily fractions until 2004 and 69.12 Gy in 32 daily fractions thereafter. The median cumulative dose was 132 Gy. Sixty-seven percent of patients had non-metastatic stage IV disease. Surgery prior to reirradiation and concomitant systemic therapy was performed in 13 (22%) and 20 (33%) patients, respectively.Median follow-up in living patients was 18.5 months. Actuarial 1-, 2- and 5-year locoregional control was 64%, 48% and 32%, respectively. Median overall (OS) and disease-free survival was 9.6 and 6.7 months, respectively. Actuarial 1-, 2- and 5-year OS was 44%, 32% and 22%, respectively. Seventeen (27%) and 2 (3%) patients had grade 3 and 4 acute toxicity, respectively. Cumulative incidence of late grade?3 toxicity was 23%, 27% and 66% at 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively. In 4 patients, death was attributed to toxicity: fatal bleeding (n=2), aspiration pneumonia (n=1) and skin necrosis (n=1).High-dose fractionated reirradiation with IMRT offers 5-year disease control and OS in recurrent head-and-neck cancer for 1/3 and 1/4 patients, respectively. Severe late toxicity after 1-2 and 5 years occurs in 1/4 and 2/3 patients, respectively.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998706","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.833344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Aspiration pneumonia","weight":0.740222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.639089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.546244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.522907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.468758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.359282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.252321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Systemic therapy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_therapy"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"2004 in film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_in_film"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Cumulative dose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_dose"}]}
