{"id":29509,"title":"Nonmedical use of prescription medications in young adults.","abstract":"Nonmedical use of prescription medications (NUPM) is an area of increasing public health concern, particularly in young adults. Young adults aged 18 to 25 have the highest annual and monthly rates of NUPM of any age group in the US, with notable consequences from using opioid, stimulant, tranquilizer and sedative medication. This article will review the literature on young adult NUPM, focusing first on the characteristics of those young adults engaged in NUPM. Then, we will examine the most common motives for NUPM, the sources young adults use to engage in nonmedical use and the related process of medication diversion. Finally, we will outline treatment and make specific recommendations of ways clinicians can help prevent the spread of NUPM in young adults, completing the work by covering future directions for research.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654550","annotations":[{"name":"Sedative","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.720529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.515372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Tranquilizer","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquilizer"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"}]}
