{"id":14672,"title":"Risk factors associated with negative in-vivo diagnostic results in bovine tuberculosis-infected cattle in Spain.","abstract":"Despite great effort and investment incurred over decades to control bovine tuberculosis (bTB), it is still one of the most important zoonotic diseases in many areas of the world. Test-and-slaughter strategies, the basis of most bTB eradication programs carried out worldwide, have demonstrated its usefulness in the control of the disease. However, in certain countries, eradication has not been achieved due in part to limitations of currently available diagnostic tests. In this study, results of in-vivo and post-mortem diagnostic tests performed on 3,614 animals from 152 bTB-infected cattle herds (beef, dairy, and bullfighting) detected in 2007-2010 in the region of Castilla y León, Spain, were analyzed to identify factors associated with positive bacteriological results in cattle that were non-reactors to the single intradermal tuberculin test, to the interferon-gamma (IFN-?) assay, or to both tests applied in parallel (Test negative/Culture + animals, T-/C+). The association of individual factors (age, productive type, and number of herd-tests performed since the disclosure of the outbreak) with the bacteriology outcome (positive/negative) was analyzed using a mixed multivariate logistic regression model.The proportion of non-reactors with a positive post-mortem result ranged from 24.3% in the case of the SIT test to 12.9% (IFN-? with 0.05 threshold) and 11.9% (95% CI 9.9-11.4%) using both tests in parallel. Older (>4.5 years) and bullfighting cattle were associated with increased odds of confirmed bTB infection by bacteriology, whereas dairy cattle showed a significantly lower risk. Ancillary use of IFN-? assay reduced the proportion of T-/C + animals in high risk groups.These results demonstrate the likelihood of positive bacteriological results in non-reactor cattle is influenced by individual epidemiological factors of tested animals. Increased surveillance on non-reactors with an increased probability of being false negative could be helpful to avoid bTB persistence, particularly in chronically infected herds. These findings may aid in the development of effective strategies for eradication of bTB in Spain.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410926","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Mycobacterium bovis","weight":0.760996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_bovis"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.729003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.635109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.603909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Beef","weight":0.485571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.467987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.452663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.307781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Dairy cattle","weight":0.264136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.249659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Investment","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Bullfighting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
