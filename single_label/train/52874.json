{"id":52874,"title":"Elevated percentage of HLA-DR? and ICAM-1? conjunctival epithelial cells in active Graves' orbitopathy.","abstract":"To evaluate if conjunctival epithelial cells' expression of HLA-DR and ICAM-1 could be helpful as early topical markers of inflammation in Graves' orbitopathy (GO).The ocular examination evaluated a clinical activity score (CAS) by assessment of clinical features, (e.g., eyelid or conjunctival inflammation, lid width, lid closure, proptosis, ocular motility). Conjunctival epithelial cell specimens for flow-cytometric evaluations of ICAM-I and HLADR expression were collected by impression cytology from ten eyes with active GO (CAS ??? 4 and duration ??? 12 months), from 15 eyes with Graves' disease (GD) without active GO (CAS 0-2) and from 15 normal specimens without any ocular disorders.The percentage of HLA-DR?+?conjunctival epithelial cells was significantly elevated in patients with active GO comparing to GD without active GO and healthy controls, 10.7 % (8.5-17.7) and 7.78 % (3.92-10.1) (p < 0.05) vs. control 4.89 % (3.5-5.5) (p < 0.005), respectively. The expression of ICAM?-?1+ conjunctival epithelial cells was greater only in patients with GO vs. controls, 5.5 % (4.8-7.03) and 1.46 % (0.69-2.51) (p?<?0.005), respectively.The percentage of HLA-DR? and ICAM-1? conjunctival epithelial cells in patients with the active GO may serve as a topical inflammation marker in Graves' orbitopathy.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562464","annotations":[{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.541137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.486391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.462205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Graves' disease","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves'_disease"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.422116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.327293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Graves' ophthalmopathy","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves'_ophthalmopathy"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"692","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/692"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Divisional General","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisional_General"},{"name":"7 and 7","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_and_7"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Graves","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
