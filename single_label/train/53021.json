{"id":53021,"title":"Circulating CD3+56+ cell subset in pre-diabetes.","abstract":"The CD3+56+ cells are a small but significant population of T lymphocytes encompassing NKT-like and NKT cells, which may play the essential role at the very early stages of atherosclerotic plaque development. The frequency and activity of CD3+56+ cells in atherosclerosis-inducing dysglycaemic disease (diabetes type 2 or pre-diabetes) is largely unknown.We analysed CD3+56+ cell count, granzyme, perforin and annexin V profiles in the peripheral blood from a group of patients with pre-diabetes, with diabetes type 2 and from non-dysglycaemic controls. Measurements were made of fasting glucose levels, HbA1c, 1,5-anhydroglucitol and lipid profile.The mean counts of CD3+56+ cells were significantly higher in patients with pre-diabetes compared to both patients with diabetes and to control group. There was an increase in the number of CD3+56+ cells producing granzyme and perforin in pre-diabetic patients compared to other groups, while there were no difference in annexin V+ populations within examined groups. It was confirmed that CD3+56+ cells count is modified by metabolic factors and their parameters, namely HbA1c and 1,5-anhydroglucitol values.It could be stated that the alterations of CD3+?56+? cells count in peripheral blood of pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients are related to different grades of carbohydrate deteriorations - postprandial hyperglycaemia and chronic hyperglycaemia.
