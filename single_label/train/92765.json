{"id":92765,"title":"Ang II-AT1R increases cell migration through PI3K/AKT and NF-?B pathways in breast cancer.","abstract":"Angiotensin II (Ang II), a biologically active peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), plays an important role in promoting cell migration via Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which Ang II affected cell migration in AT1R-positive MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Ang II increased cell migration and expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2,-9 in a dose-dependent manner. Ang II-mediated cell migration was reduced by specific blocking of MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as with pretreatment with inhibitors of AT1R, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and NF-?B. Similarly, Ang II-mediated expression of MMP-2,-9 was downregulated by pretreatment with inhibitors of AT1R and PI3K. In addition, Ang II treatment significantly induced phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, and resulted in increased NF-?B activity. These findings suggest that Ang II activates the AT1R/PI3K/Akt pathway, which further activates IKK?/? and NF-?B, resulting in enhanced expression of MMP-2,-9 and migration in human breast cancer cells. Therefore, targeting Ang II/AT1R/PI3K/Akt/NF-?B signaling could be a novel anti-metastatic therapy for breast cancer.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692224","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.813139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.779167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.662888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.437845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.389465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.370858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.347214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.285668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.119684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"}]}
