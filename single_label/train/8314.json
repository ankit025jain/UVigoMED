{"id":8314,"title":"Animal models and the tumor microenvironment: studies of tumor-host symbiosis.","abstract":"The contributions of murine models to elucidation of processes central to tumor growth are reviewed. Localized acidosis, increased interstitial pressure, perturbations in structure and function of the extracellular matrix, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and co-optation of the immune response are all phenomena that promote tumor survival and metastasis. The use of animal models is critical to understanding the pathophysiology of these processes and the development of more effective cancer therapies.
