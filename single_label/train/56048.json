{"id":56048,"title":"The role of the mesopic pupil on patient-reported outcomes in young patients with myopia 1 month after wavefront-guided LASIK.","abstract":"To determine the relationship between low-light pupil size and patient-reported outcomes 1 month after wavefront-guided LASIK in young patients with myopia.Retrospective case series of 10,944 eyes of 5,563 young patients with myopia who underwent wavefront-guided LASIK (6.0-mm optical zone). Preoperative pupil size was measured under low-light conditions with an infrared pupillometer. Visual and refractive outcomes were evaluated at 1 month postoperatively. A questionnaire was administered to assess patient-reported outcomes including satisfaction with the procedure, night driving, and glare and halo visual symptoms.The average patient age was 29.8 years (range: 18 to 40 years). The mean preoperative manifest spherical equivalent of -3.49 diopters (D) (range: -0.50 to -11.75 D) was reduced to -0.04 Â± 0.29 D at 1 month, with 94% of eyes achieving an uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/20 or better. The mean low-light pupil diameter was 6.6 mm (range: 4 to 9 mm) and 1,514 patients (27.2%) had a diameter of 8 mm or larger. No correlation between pupil diameter and patient-reported outcomes was found (r range: -0.02 to 0.07). Logistic regression analysis identified postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity and postoperative manifest refraction as significant predictors of night halo complaints after wavefront-guided LASIK (P < .01).In this large series of young patients with myopia treated with wavefront-guided LASIK, low-light pupil diameter was not predictive of surgery satisfaction, ability to perform activities, or visual symptoms at 1 month postoperatively.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763720","annotations":[{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.630976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.612511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.492341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.412705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.366559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Halo (optical phenomenon)","weight":0.225541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.204754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.167804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Mesopic vision","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopic_vision"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Glare (vision)","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glare_(vision)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"944","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/944"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
