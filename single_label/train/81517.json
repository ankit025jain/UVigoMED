{"id":81517,"title":"Understanding the chemistry of dental erosion.","abstract":"Dental erosion is caused by repeated short episodes of exposure to acids. Dental minerals are calcium-deficient, carbonated hydroxyapatites containing impurity ions such as Na(+), Mg(2+) and Cl(-). The rate of dissolution, which is crucial to the progression of erosion, is influenced by solubility and also by other factors. After outlining principles of solubility and acid dissolution, this chapter describes the factors related to the dental tissues on the one hand and to the erosive solution on the other. The impurities in the dental mineral introduce crystal strain and increase solubility, so dentine mineral is more soluble than enamel mineral and both are more soluble than hydroxyapatite. The considerable differences in structure and porosity between dentine and enamel influence interactions of the tissues with acid solutions, so the relative rates of dissolution do not necessarily reflect the respective solubilities. The rate of dissolution is further influenced strongly by physical factors (temperature, flow rate) and chemical factors (degree of saturation, presence of inhibitors, buffering, pH, fluoride). Temperature and flow rate, as determined by the method of consumption of a product, strongly influence erosion in vivo. The net effect of the solution factors determines the overall erosive potential of different products. Prospects for remineralization of erosive lesions are evaluated.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993265","annotations":[{"name":"Hydroxylapatite","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Carbonation","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonation"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.494956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.472218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.430842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.428298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Remineralisation of teeth","weight":0.406131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remineralisation_of_teeth"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.390897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.319056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Buffering agent","weight":0.220177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffering_agent"},{"name":"Acid erosion","weight":0.149167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_erosion"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Impurity","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impurity"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"}]}
