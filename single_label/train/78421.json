{"id":78421,"title":"[Employment of auditory brainstem responses in verification and objectification of impairment of hearing in criminal legal proceedings].","abstract":"There are numerous subjective and objective diagnostic methods which allow for assessing the degree of the hearing loss and its anatomical location. Despite widespread availability of those methods, especially the subjective ones, such as pure tone audiometry or speech audiometry, diagnostic errors still frequently occur. They may lead to drawing false conclusions and issuing a fallacious medicolegal expert opinion, which obviously aggravates the situation of the defendant. Medicolegal experience has shown that these errors may result from employment of classic, subjective only methods of hearing examination and failure to perform objective tests, in particular auditory brainstem responses (ABR), autoacustic emissions (OAEs) and audiometry impendance (AI).","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672895","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.658771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.511622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.462754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.40613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.152239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Expert witness","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness"},{"name":"Fallacy","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Pure tone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Defendant","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Pitch (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Falsifiability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Medical law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_law"},{"name":"Objectification","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification"}]}
