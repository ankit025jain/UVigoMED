{"id":78370,"title":"Examining the construct validity of the V-RQOL in speakers who use alaryngeal voice.","abstract":"The construct validity of the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL; Hogikyan & Sethuraman, 1999) measure was evaluated in a sample of 109 individuals who have undergone total laryngectomy.A principal components factor analysis was performed on participant responses to the 10-question V-RQOL measure.Factor analysis of the V-RQOL in our alaryngeal sample confirmed the presence of two factors (physical and social-emotional), which is consistent with the identified domains in the current V-RQOL. However, the current data indicate that some of the questions proposed by the original authors of the V-RQOL (Questions 7 and 9) do not align with their proposed domains in this postlaryngectomy sample.The results indicate that some V-RQOL questions do not align with their proposed domains. Consequently, an alternative scoring algorithm may be warranted for alaryngeal populations, and the authors make suggestions for this change that are simple and efficient. Based on the findings of the present factor analysis, use of this modified scoring procedure may serve to increase the sensitivity of the V-RQOL for those who are laryngectomized and use alaryngeal methods of voice and speech. Consequently, the value and application of the V-RQOL may be expanded in the clinical setting.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686439","annotations":[{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.844903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.499036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.388093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Loudspeaker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Factorization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Efficiency (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)"},{"name":"Life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
