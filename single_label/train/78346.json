{"id":78346,"title":"Co-expression of perforin and granzyme B genes induces apoptosis and inhibits the tumorigenicity of laryngeal cancer cell line Hep-2.","abstract":"Granzyme B and perforin, two of the most important components, have shown anticancer properties in various cancers, but their effects in laryngeal cancer remain unexplored. Here we decided to examine the effects of Granzyme B and perforin in Hep-2 cells and clarify the role of perforin and granzyme B in the tumorigenicity of laryngeal cancer cell line. Hep-2 cells were transfected with pVAX1-PIG co-expression vector (comprising perforin and granzyme B genes), and then the growth and apoptosis of these Hep-2 cells were evaluated. The tumorigenicity of Hep-2 cell line co-expressing perforin and granzyme B genes was tested in BALB/c nu/nu mice. We found that the co-expression of perforin and granzyme B genes could obviously inhibit cell focus formation and induce cell apoptosis in Hep-2 cells. Furthermore, after subcutaneous injection of Hep-2 cells transfected with pVAX1-PIG, an extensive delay in tumor growth was observed in BALB/c-nu/nu mice. Moreover, our studies demonstrated that the anticancer activity of perforin and granzyme B was sustainable in vivo as tumor development by inducing cell apoptosis. Taken together, our data indicate that the co-expression of perforin and granzyme B genes exhibits anticancer potential, and hopefully provide potential therapeutic applications in laryngeal cancer.
