{"id":69588,"title":"Adaptation and implementation of the \"Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)\" guidelines for evaluation and management of mineral and bone disorders in chronic kidney disease for practice in the Middle East countries.","abstract":"This review presents the views of an expert group of nephrologists from the Middle East along with an international expert on adaptation and implementation of the 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for evaluation and manage-ment of mineral and bone disorders in chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD) for practice in the Middle East countries. The members of the panel examined the KDIGO guidelines and formulated recommendations that can be implemented practically for the management of CKD-MBD in the Middle East. There was a broad agreement on most of the recommendations made by the KDIGO work-group. However, the panelists commented on specific areas and amplified certain concepts that might help the nephrologists in the Middle East. The final document was reviewed by all participants as well as by members of the Middle East task force implementation group for KDIGO guidelines. Their comments were incorporated. The guideline statements are presented along with detailed rationale and relevant discussion as well as limitations of the evidence. The panel recognized the need to upgrade the suggestion of KDIGO related to lateral abdominal radiograph and echocardiogram in patients with CKD stages 3-5D into a stronger recommendation. The panel underlined the risk of hyper-phosphatemia to CKD-MBD and the importance of prompt initiation or modification of therapy according to rising trends in para-thyroid hormone level. They recommended the use of non-calcium-based phosphate binders as the first-line therapy in CKD patients with signs of vascular calcification. The panel agreed that all aspects of the KDIGO recommendations concerning bone biopsy, evaluation and treatment of bone disease after kidney trans-plantation should be implemented as such.
