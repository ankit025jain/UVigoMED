{"id":17241,"title":"Porcine cathelicidins efficiently complex and deliver nucleic acids to plasmacytoid dendritic cells and can thereby mediate bacteria-induced IFN-? responses.","abstract":"Cathelicidins constitute potent antimicrobial peptides characterized by a high cationic charge that enables strong interactions with nucleic acids. In fact, the only human cathelicidin LL-37 triggers rapid sensing of nucleic acids by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). Among the porcine cathelicidins, phylogenetic analysis of the C-terminal mature peptide showed that porcine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (PMAP)-36 was the most closely related of the 11 porcine cathelicidins to human LL-37. Despite several investigations evaluating potent antimicrobial functions of porcine cathelicidins, nothing is known about their ability to promote pDC activation. We therefore investigated the capacity of the proline-arginine-rich 39-aa peptide, PMAP-23, PMAP-36, and protegrin-1 to complex with bacterial DNA or synthetic RNA molecules and facilitate pDC activation. We demonstrate that these peptides mediate a rapid and efficient uptake of nucleic acids within minutes, followed by robust IFN-? responses. The highest positively charged cathelicidin, PMAP-36, was found to be the most potent peptide tested for this effect. The peptide-DNA complexes were internalized and also found to associate with the cell membranes of pDC. The amphipathic conformation typical of PMAP-36 was not required for IFN-? induction in pDC. We also demonstrate that PMAP-36 can mediate IFN-? induction in pDC stimulated by Escherichia coli, which alone fail to activate pDC. This response was weaker with a scrambled PMAP-36, relating to its lower antimicrobial activity. Collectively, our data suggest that the antimicrobial and nucleic acid-complexing properties of cathelicidins can mediate pDC activation-promoting adaptive immune responses against microbial infections.
