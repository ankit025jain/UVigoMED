{"id":53599,"title":"Recurrence-predicting prognostic factors for patients with early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer undergoing fertility-sparing surgery: a multi-institutional study.","abstract":"We reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients with early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who had undergone fertility-sparing surgery (FSS) to assess recurrence-free survival (RFS).After central pathological review and scanning of the medical records of multiple institutions, a total of 94 patients with stage I EOC (IA: 43 and IC: 51) treated with FSS were analyzed. IC substages were defined as follows: intraoperative spillage (IC1), preoperative capsule rupture or surface invasion (IC2), and positive cytology results (IC3).The median age was 30.5 (13-40) years. The median follow-up time was 66.6 months. Fourteen patients (14.9%) showed carcinoma recurrence. Eleven (11.7%) patients died of the disease. The total 5-year RFS rate including all women who received FSS was 84.3%. There was no significant difference in RFS between patients with IC1 and those with stage IA (P=0.9411). In contrast, the RFS rate of patients with IC2/3 was significantly poorer than in patients with stage IA (IA vs. IC2/3: P=0.0487, IC1 vs. IC2/3: P=0.0471). In further analyses according to each histological type and grade, the RFS rate of subjects with the mucinous type was the same as that of those with a clear-cell histology (P=0.3350). There was a significant difference in RFS of patients with grade 1 (G1) and G2-3 (P=0.0004). To eliminate selection bias from a number of clinicopathologic factors as thoroughly as possible, the age, FIGO stage, histological type, grade, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were entered into multivariate RFS analyses. Cox multivariable analysis showed that the substage group and grade were independent prognostic factors for RFS.Confined to young women with intraoperative rupture, FSS may be proposed, if without tumor-associated dense adhesion. However, those with preoperative rupture, surface invasion, and positive cytology showed a greater risk of recurrence, suggesting that they are not recommended candidates. Although patients with G2-3 tumors showed a poorer prognosis than those with G1, the number of these subjects was so small that the current results should be reconfirmed in the next study.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507757","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Gynecology_and_Obstetrics"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.849703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.747526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.556001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.334462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0471911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Selection bias","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
