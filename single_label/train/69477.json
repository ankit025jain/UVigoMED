{"id":69477,"title":"Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography with intravesical administration of a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent for diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux: prospective evaluation of contrast safety in 1,010 children.","abstract":"To evaluate the safety of intravesical administration of a second-generation ultrasound (US) contrast agent for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in children.One thousand and ten children (563 girls, 447 boys; mean age: 2.9 years, range: 15 days-17.6 years) with 2,043 pelvi-ureter-units underwent contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (ce-VUS) to rule out vesicoureteral reflux. A second-generation US contrast agent (SonoVue®, Bracco, Milan) was administered intravesically through transurethral bladder catheterization at a dose of 0.5 ml/bladder filling. Possible adverse events were monitored during the examination and followed up for 7 days after ce-VUS by phone calls. Urine analysis and culture were performed 3-5 days before ce-VUS in all children and 24-48 h in any patient who reported with adverse events.No case of serious adverse event was recorded. Minor events were reported in 37 children (3.66% of the study population). These included dysuria (n?=?26, 2.57%), urinary retention (n?=?2, 0.2%), abdominal pain (n?=?2, 0.2%), anxiety (n?=?1, 0.1%) and crying (n?=?1, 0.1%) during micturition, blood and mucous discharge (n?=?1, 0.1%), increased frequency of micturition (n?=?1, 0.1%), vomiting (n?=?1, 0.1%), perineal irritation (n?=?1, 0.1%), and an episode of urinary tract infection 10 days after ce-VUS (n?=?1, 0.1%). Of these adverse events, 91.9% were subacute in onset and 8.1% were delayed. All events were self-limited and none required hospitalization.There were no serious adverse events. Only a few minor events were reported, most likely due to the catheterization process. Thus, ce-VUS with intravesical administration of the second-generation US contrast agent (SonoVue®) for vesicoureteral reflux detection or exclusion had a favorable safety profile in our study group.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442338","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Dysuria","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysuria"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.828651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.725411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Urinalysis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinalysis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.65303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Vesicoureteral reflux","weight":0.630976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicoureteral_reflux"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.620796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.561136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.133789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Crying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying"}]}
