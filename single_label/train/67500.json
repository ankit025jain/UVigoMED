{"id":67500,"title":"Immunologic human renal allograft injury associates with an altered IL-10/TNF-? expression ratio in regulatory B cells.","abstract":"Human B cells with immunoregulatory properties in vitro (Bregs) have been defined by the expression of IL-10 and are enriched in various B-cell subsets. However, proinflammatory cytokine expression in B-cell subsets is largely unexplored. We examined the cytokine profiles of human PBMCs and found that subsets of CD24(hi)CD38(hi) transitional B cells (TrBs), CD24(hi)CD27(+) memory B cells, and naïve B cells express IL-10 and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-? simultaneously. TrBs had the highest IL-10/TNF-? ratio and suppressed proinflammatory helper T cell 1 (Th1) cytokine expression by autologous T cells in vitro more potently than memory B cells did, despite similar IL-10 expression. Whereas neutralization of IL-10 significantly inhibited TrB-mediated suppression of autologous Th1 cytokine expression, blocking TNF-? increased the suppressive capacity of both memory and naïve B-cell subsets. Thus, the ratio of IL-10/TNF-? expression, a measure of cytokine polarization, may be a better indicator of regulatory function than IL-10 expression alone. Indeed, compared with TrB cells from patients with stable kidney graft function, TrBs from patients with graft rejection displayed similar IL-10 expression levels but increased TNF-? expression (i.e., reduced IL-10/TNF-? ratio), did not inhibit in vitro expression of Th1 cytokines by T cells, and abnormally suppressed expression of Th2 cytokines. In patients with graft dysfunction, a low IL-10/TNF-? ratio in TrBs associated with poor graft outcomes after 3 years of follow-up. In summary, these results indicate that B cell-mediated immune regulation is best characterized by the cytokine polarization profile, a finding that was confirmed in renal transplant patients.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610932","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.821325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.718887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.652616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.574151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.521832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.457609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Memory B cell","weight":0.323099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"},{"name":"Proinflammatory cytokine","weight":0.318828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proinflammatory_cytokine"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.117504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"CD24","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD24"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"}]}
