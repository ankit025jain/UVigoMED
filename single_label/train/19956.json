{"id":19956,"title":"Immune responses to O-specific polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide of Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa in adult Bangladeshi recipients of an oral killed cholera vaccine and comparison to responses in patients with cholera.","abstract":"Protective immunity to cholera is serogroup specific, and serogrouping is defined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We characterized OSP-specific immune responses in adult recipients of an oral killed cholera vaccine (OCV WC-rBS) and compared these with responses in patients with cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa. Although vaccinees developed plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA antibody and antibody secreting cell (ASC, marker of mucosal response) to Ogawa OSP and LPS 7 days after vaccination, responses were significantly lower than that which occurred after cholera. Similarly, patients recovering from cholera had detectable IgA, IgM, and IgG memory B cell (MBC) responses against OSP and LPS on Day 30 and Day 90, whereas vaccinees only developed IgG responses to OSP 30 days after the second immunization. The markedly lower ASC and MBC responses to OSP and LPS observed among vaccinees might explain, in part, the lower protection of an OCV compared with natural infection.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686738","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Memory B cell","weight":0.900055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Vibrio cholerae","weight":0.848889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.625722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cholera","weight":0.60197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.409575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cholera vaccine","weight":0.33577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_vaccine"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.0545744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"O antigen","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_antigen"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
