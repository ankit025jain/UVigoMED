{"id":83291,"title":"Translating human genetics into novel treatment targets for schizophrenia.","abstract":"Human genetics is a rational starting point for target identification in drug discovery, yet this approach has found little application in neuroscience. Recent large-scale analyses have begun to identify robust genetic loci for schizophrenia, providing an opportunity to derive novel drug targets. Here, we summarize a strategy for applying human genetics to neuroscience drug discovery.
