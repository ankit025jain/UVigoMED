{"id":10548,"title":"A crucial role of L-selectin in C protein-induced experimental polymyositis in mice.","abstract":"To investigate the role of adhesion molecules in C protein-induced myositis (CIM), a murine model of polymyositis (PM).CIM was induced in wild-type mice, L-selectin-deficient (L-selectin(-/-) ) mice, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)-deficient (ICAM-1(-/-) ) mice, and mice deficient in both L-selectin and ICAM-1 (L-selectin(-/-) ICAM-1(-/-) mice). Myositis severity, inflammatory cell infiltration, and messenger RNA expression in the inflamed muscles were analyzed. The effect of dendritic polyglycerol sulfate, a synthetic inhibitor that suppresses the function of L-selectin and endothelial P-selectin, was also examined.L-selectin(-/-) mice and L-selectin(-/-) ICAM-1(-/-) mice developed significantly less severe myositis compared to wild-type mice, while ICAM-1 deficiency did not inhibit the development of myositis. L-selectin(-/-) mice that received wild-type T cells developed myositis. Treatment with dendritic polyglycerol sulfate significantly diminished the severity of myositis in wild-type mice compared to treatment with control.These data indicate that L-selectin plays a major role in the development of CIM, whereas ICAM-1 plays a lesser role, if any, in the development of CIM. L-selectin-targeted therapy may be a candidate for the treatment of PM.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24644046","annotations":[{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.903728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.78456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.638817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.402592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.26678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Myositis","weight":0.195016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis"},{"name":"Polymyositis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyositis"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.0797117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
