{"id":82788,"title":"Altered histone mark deposition and DNA methylation at homeobox genes in human oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"We recently reported a role of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and PRC2 trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in the regulation of homeobox (HOX) (Marcinkiewicz and Gudas, 2013, Exp Cell Res) gene transcript levels in human oral keratinocytes (OKF6-TERT1R) and tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. Here, we assessed both the levels of various histone modifications at a subset of homeobox genes and genome wide DNA methylation patterns in OKF6-TERT1R and SCC-9 cells by using ERRBS (enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing). We detected the H3K9me3 mark at HOXB7, HOXC10, HOXC13, and HOXD8 at levels higher in OKF6-TERT1R than in SCC-9 cells; at IRX1 and SIX2 the H3K9me3 levels were conversely higher in SCC-9 than in OKF6-TERT1R. The H3K79me3 mark was detectable only at IRX1 in OKF6-TERT1R and at IRX4 in SCC-9 cells. The levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks correlate with the transcript levels of the assessed homeobox genes in both OKF6-TERT1R and SCC-9. We detected generally lower CpG methylation levels on DNA in SCC-9 cells at annotated genomic regions which were differentially methylated between OKF6-TERT1R and SCC-9 cells; however, some genomic regions, including the HOX gene clusters, showed DNA methylation at higher levels in SCC-9 than OKF6-TERT1R. Thus, both altered histone modification patterns and changes in DNA methylation are associated with dysregulation of homeobox gene expression in human oral cavity SCC cells, and this dysregulation potentially plays a role in the neoplastic phenotype of oral keratinocytes.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519855","annotations":[{"name":"Bisulfite sequencing","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Hox gene","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hox_gene"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Polycomb-group proteins","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycomb-group_proteins"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.754147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Homeobox","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.667039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"PRC2","weight":0.649337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRC2"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.631481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Telomerase reverse transcriptase","weight":0.607377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase_reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Histone H3","weight":0.524539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_H3"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.41854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Annotation","weight":0.292202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.233977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Bisulfite","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.113159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"People's Republic of China","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
