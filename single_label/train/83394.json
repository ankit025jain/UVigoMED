{"id":83394,"title":"Advances in pain management: game changers in knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"Over the past 30 years there have been many improvements in implant fixation, correction of deformity, improved polyethylene wear, and survival after knee replacement. The work over the last decade has focused on less invasive surgical techniques, multimodal pain management protocols, more rapid functional recovery and reduced length of stay, aiming to minimise the side effects of treatment while maintaining function and implant durability. When combined and standardised these pre-, intra- and post-operative factors have now facilitated outpatient knee replacement procedures for unicompartmental replacement, patella femoral arthroplasty and total knee replacement (TKR). We have found liposomal bupivacaine, with potential for longer therapeutic action, to be a helpful adjunct and describe our current pain management program. The next step in our multimodal program is to improve the duration of patient satisfaction and reduce cost and length of stay after TKR.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381400","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.677503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.619924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.3432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.339068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0925123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Multimodal therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_therapy"},{"name":"Bupivacaine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupivacaine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Video game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Team Knight Rider","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Knight_Rider"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
