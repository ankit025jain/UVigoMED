{"id":90958,"title":"A booming economy means a bursting trauma system: association between hospital admission for major injury and indicators of economic activity in a large Canadian health region.","abstract":"Injury epidemiology fluctuates with economic activity in many countries. These relationships remain unclear in Canada.The annual risk of admission for major injury (Injury Severity Score ?12) to a high-volume, level-1 Canadian trauma center was compared with indicators of economic activity over a 16-year period using linear regression.An increased risk of injured patient admissions was associated with rising mean gross domestic product (GDP [millions of chained 2002 dollars]) (.36 person increase per 100,000 population/$1,000 increase in GDP; P = .001) and annual gasoline prices (.47 person increase per 100,000 population/cent increase in gasoline price; P = .001). Recreation-related vehicle injuries were also associated with economic affluence. The risk of trauma patient mortality with increasing mean annual GDP (P = .72) and gasoline prices (P = .32) remained unchanged.Hospital admissions for major injury, but not trauma patient mortality, were associated with economic activity in a large Canadian health care region.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560360","annotations":[{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.729513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.722143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.610548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.487328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.468693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Inflation","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation"},{"name":"Price","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"},{"name":"Gasoline","weight":0.363838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.331777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.240104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Wealth","weight":0.178566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Price of petroleum","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_petroleum"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Boom and bust","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_and_bust"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Health care in Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Canada"},{"name":"Gasoline and diesel usage and pricing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_and_diesel_usage_and_pricing"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Revenue","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue"}]}
