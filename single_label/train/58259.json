{"id":58259,"title":"Prenatal exposure to manganese at environment relevant level and neonatal neurobehavioral development.","abstract":"Effects of prenatal Manganese (Mn) exposure at an environmental relevant level on neonatal neurodevelopment remains unclear.In the multi-center study, we assessed the impact of low level prenatal Mn exposure on neonatal behavioral neurological assessments (NBNA), and explore a threshold umbilical cord blood Mn on neonatal neurological development.We investigated 933 mother-newborn pairs in Shanghai, China, from 2008 through 2009. Umbilical cord serum concentrations of Mn were measured and NBNA tests were conducted. The NBNA contains five clusters: behavior, active tone, passive tone, primary reflexes and general assessment with a maximal total score of 40. The score<37 is defined as low.The median serum Mn concentration was 4.0 ?g/L. Of the 933 infants, 44 (4.7%) had low NBNA. After adjusting for potential confounders, a high level of Mn (? 75th percentile ) was associated with a lower NBNA score (adjusted ÃŸ=-1.1, 95% CI: -1.4-0.7, p<0.01) and a higher risk of low NBNA (adjusted OR=9.4, 95% CI: 3.4-25.7, p<0.01). A nonlinear relationship was observed between cord serum Mn and NBNA after adjusting for potential confounders. NBNA score decreased with increasing Mn levels after 5.0 ?g/L(LgMn ? 0.7). The cord serum Mn ? 5.0 ?g/L had adverse effects on behavior, active tone and general reactions of clusters (p<0.001).High prenatal Mn exposure even at an environmental relevant level, is associated with poor fetal neurobehavioral development in a nonlinear pattern. A threshold cord serum Mn of 5.0 ?g/L existed for lower neonatal behavioral neurological assessments.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24971720","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.741588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.64566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.549042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.424505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Manganese","weight":0.257246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.170722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0894997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Smoking and pregnancy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_and_pregnancy"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Tone (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)"},{"name":"933","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/933"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 425","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_425"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"75th United States Congress","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
