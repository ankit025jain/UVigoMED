{"id":32806,"title":"Manufacturing models of fetal malformations built from 3-dimensional ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography scan data.","abstract":"Technological innovations accompanying advances in medicine have given rise to the possibility of obtaining better-defined fetal images that assist in medical diagnosis and contribute toward genetic counseling offered to parents during the prenatal period. In this article, we show our innovative experience of diagnosing fetal malformations through correlating 3-dimensional ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography, which are accurate techniques for fetal assessment, with a fetal image reconstruction technique to create physical fetal models.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901782","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"History of medicine","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_medicine"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.607387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.333138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.28735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Image processing","weight":0.229228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Congenital abnormality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_abnormality"}]}
