{"id":85553,"title":"[Sleep disorders and epilepsy].","abstract":"It has been reported that patients with epilepsy often have insomnia and/or daytime sleepiness; the symptomatologic features differ in seizure types. Not only the administration of anti-epileptics, but also inappropriate sleep hygiene cause daytime sleepiness. In subjective assessment of sleepiness, we need to pay attention if it can correctly assess or not. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with epilepsy is approximately 10-30%. Sleep apnea deteriorates the seizure control because of worsen sleep condition by sleep apnea, especially in elderly patients. Some researchers report that continuous positive airway pressure was effective for seizure control. Patients with epilepsy occasionally have REM sleep behavior disorder as comorbidity. Examination using polysomnography is required for differential diagnosis.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912295","annotations":[{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Sleep hygiene","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_hygiene"},{"name":"Rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.65962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Excessive daytime sleepiness","weight":0.65757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excessive_daytime_sleepiness"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.490923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.061875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Seizure types","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure_types"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"}]}
