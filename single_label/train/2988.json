{"id":2988,"title":"[Tocolysis with nifedipin; its use in current practice].","abstract":"The aim of the study is to establish the safety and efficacy of calcium channel blocker- Nifedipin as tocolytic agents. A wide range of tocolytics have been utilized for the management of preterm labor Calcium channel blockers, namely nifedipine, gained popularity as tocolytics due to the oral route of administration, availability of immediate- and slow-release preparations, the low incidence of maternal adverse effects associated with their use, and the fact that they are inexpensive.88 pregnant women in preterm labor participated in a prospective longitudinal study Inclusion criteria were: gestational age between 24 and 34 weeks gestation; uterine contractions in 10-15 min interval; single pregnancy, lack of contraindications for tocolysis. In all cases the calcium antagonist Nifedipine was used in dosage 4 x 10 mg per os. The clinical response to tocolysis, gestational age at delivery and potential side effects were analyzed.91 pregnant women participated in the study. Three were excluded because they refused to participate. 88 pregnancies were finally analyzed. In nine of them maternal contractions persisted despite of treatment. The other 79 pregnancies were delayed 48 hours to receive antenatal corticosteroids. From all these 79 pregancies 66 delayed 7 days. The most common adverse effects were tachycardia, hypotonia, headache, dizziness, but they escape soon after the first dose.Nifedipine is an effective oral tocolytic with few maternal side effects.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510034","annotations":[{"name":"Nifedipine","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifedipine"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.810785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.808394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.764874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.75769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.713495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.692417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Hypotonia","weight":0.666104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.623117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Uterine contraction","weight":0.530843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_contraction"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.462773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Tocolytic","weight":0.333889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocolytic"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0538916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
