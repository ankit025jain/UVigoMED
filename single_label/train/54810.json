{"id":54810,"title":"[Retinal pneumopexy in the treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficiency of retinal pneumopexy in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.This clinical prospective study unrolled between november 2010-june 2012 in the Ophthalmology Department of the Military Hospital in Cluj-Napoca and Satu Mare Emergency Hospital included 20 patients (20 eyes) with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Patients were treated with retinal pneumopexy followed by laser photocoagulation.Anatomical and functional results were evaluated 1, 3, 6, 12 and 19 months after treatment. In 17 eyes out of 20, we achieved retinal reattachment and visual recovery. Three cases yelded no success, these being further treated with posterior vitrectomy.Retinal pneumopexy is a minimally invasive treatment method of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with very good results in well selected cases.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145123","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.700774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.672399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.5974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.513335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.256173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.189447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Scleral buckle","weight":0.0354274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_buckle"},{"name":"Satu Mare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satu_Mare"},{"name":"June","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Loop unwinding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unwinding"},{"name":"Military hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_hospital"},{"name":"Mare","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare"},{"name":"Replantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replantation"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hospital emergency codes","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_emergency_codes"},{"name":"Oklahoma Military Department","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Military_Department"}]}
