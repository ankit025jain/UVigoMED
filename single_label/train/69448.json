{"id":69448,"title":"Risk factors of sexual dysfunction after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): a 12 months follow-up.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of risk factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in men with lower urinary tract symptoms caused by bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The study was conducted prospectively on 178 consecutive patients (normal IIEF-5 before surgery, ? 22) who underwent TURP. Patients were assessed before surgery and at 12 months. At 12 months, the IIEF-5 score significantly decreased from24 to 18 (p<0.0001). No statistical associations were found between hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and capsular perforation and the development of ED after TURP. Operating time, duration of catheterization, and BMI did not determine a significant decrease of the IIEF-5 score after TURP. On univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis, age was the only risk factor associated with newly-reported ED 12 months after TURP (p<0.0001). On univariable andmultivariable logistic regression analysis, patients older than 65 yr had an higher risk of developing ED after TURP (p<0.0001) and they developed a lower IIEF-5 score (p<0.0001) at followup when compared with those ? 65 yr. These results suggest that age of patients represents an independent risk factor of ED at 12 months follow-up after TURP.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445123","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.817416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.717882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.579123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.393744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.390766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.328331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.114428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Obstructive uropathy","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_uropathy"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"}]}
