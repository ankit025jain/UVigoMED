{"id":30975,"title":"Diabetes-causing gene, kruppel-like factor 11, modulates the antinociceptive response of chronic ethanol intake.","abstract":"Alcohol (EtOH [ethanol]) is an antinociceptive agent, working in part, by reducing sensitivity to painful stimuli. The transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 11 (KLF11), a human diabetes-causing gene that also regulates the neurotransmitter metabolic enzymes monoamine oxidase (MAO), has recently been identified as an EtOH-inducible gene. However, its role in antinociception remains unknown. Consequently, we investigated the function of KLF11 in chronic EtOH-induced antinociception using a genetically engineered knockout mouse model.Wild-type (Klf11(+/+) ) and KLF11 knockout (Klf11(-/-) ) mice were fed a liquid diet containing EtOH for 28 days with increasing amounts of EtOH from 0% up to a final concentration of 6.4%, representing a final diet containing 36% of calories primarily from EtOH. Control mice from both genotypes were fed liquid diet without EtOH for 28 days. The EtOH-induced antinociceptive effect was determined using the tail-flick test before and after EtOH exposure (on day 29). In addition, the enzyme activity and mRNA levels of MAO A and MAO B were measured by real-time RT-PCR and enzyme assays, respectively.EtOH produced an antinociceptive response to thermal pain in Klf11(+/+) mice, as expected. In contrast, deletion of KLF11 in the Klf11(-/-) mice abolished the EtOH-induced antinociceptive effect. The mRNA and protein levels of KLF11 were significantly increased in the brain prefrontal cortex of Klf11(+/+) mice exposed to EtOH compared with control Klf11(+/+) mice. Furthermore, MAO enzyme activities were affected differently in Klf11 wild-type versus Klf11 knockout mice exposed to chronic EtOH. Chronic EtOH intake significantly increased MAO B activity in Klf11(+/+) mice.The data show KLF11 modulation of EtOH-induced antinociception. The KLF11-targeted MAO B enzyme may contribute more significantly to EtOH-induced antinociception. Thus, this study revealed a new role for the KLF11 gene in the mechanisms underlying the antinociceptive effects of chronic EtOH exposure.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24428663","annotations":[{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Prefrontal cortex","weight":0.792965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.781448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Monoamine neurotransmitter","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.75761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.712318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.694102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.577638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.541068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Monoamine oxidase","weight":0.507426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.241231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.121605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Cytochrome c oxidase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.011569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
