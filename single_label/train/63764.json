{"id":63764,"title":"Clinical significance and detection of microRNA-21 in serum of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in Chinese population.","abstract":"Expression patterns of microRNAs in serum are involved in potentially non-invasive biomarkers for various diseases. The purpose of this study is to examine the expression of miR-21 in serum of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to validate the significance of miR-21 in early diagnosis, genotyping, treatment options as well as its prognosis estimates of Chinese DLBCL.miR-21 expression was detected by fluorescent quantity polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 9 DLBCL cell lines (OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly3, OCI-Ly4, OCI-Ly7, OCI-Ly8, OCI-Ly10, OCI-Ly18, OCI-Ly19, and HBL), as well as in tumor tissue and serum samples from patients with DLBCL (germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL 32; activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL 30) and 50 healthy subjects.Expression of miR-21 was increased in DLBCL cell lines. Compared with the miR-21 expression of GCB subgroup (OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly4, OCI-Ly7, OCI-Ly8, OCI-Ly18, OCI-Ly19), ABC subgroup (OCI-Ly3, OCI-Ly10, and HBL) has higher expression (t = 11.18, P < 0.01). Circulating miR-21 level in sera from patients with DLBCLwas associated with matched tumor tissue (r(2) = 0.931, P < 0.0001). Consistent with the in vitro, miR-21 expression levels in serum of patients with DLBCL [21.38(10.26-45.21)] were higher than those in serum of control cases [1.87(1.05-3.97); U = 168, P = 0.000]. Moreover, miR-21 expression levels in serum of patients with subgroup ABC [28.68(14.92~98.44)] were higher than that of patients with subgroup GCB [18.3(7.32~33.46); U = 336, P = 0.043]. miR-21 expression in serum of DLBCL with stage I and II were higher than those in stage III and IV (U = 62, P = 0.013 in GCB type; U = 53, P = 0.014 in ABC type). Compared with relapse-free survival in patients with DLBCL, high expression of miR-21 was associated with well prognosis (U = 259, P = 0.035).miR-21 expressed in the serum of patients with DLBCL from Chinese was associated with clinical stage, molecular subgroup, and prognosis estimates. miR-21 may be served as a biomarker in early diagnosis, genotyping, treatment options, and prognosis estimating of Chinese DLBCL.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400911","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.7721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.745269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.688541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.660011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.611136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.588739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.528807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.231057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.165452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.153971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0998945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"American Broadcasting Company","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company"},{"name":"Germinal center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinal_center"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
