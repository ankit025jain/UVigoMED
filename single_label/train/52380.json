{"id":52380,"title":"Growth hormone exposure as a risk factor for the development of subsequent neoplasms of the central nervous system: a report from the childhood cancer survivor study.","abstract":"Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) predisposes to GH deficiency and subsequent neoplasms (SNs) of the central nervous system (CNS). Increased rates of SNs have been reported in GH-treated survivors.The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between GH treatment and the development of CNS-SNs.The study was designed with a retrospective cohort with longitudinal follow-up.The setting of the study was multiinstitutional.A total of 12 098 5-year pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, diagnosed with cancer prior to age 21 years, of whom 338 self-reported GH treatment, which was verified through medical record review.INTERVENTIONS included subject surveys, medical records abstraction, and pathological review.Incidence of meningioma, glioma, and other CNS-SNs was measured.Among GH-treated survivors, 16 (4.7%) developed CNS-SN, including 10 with meningioma and six with glioma. Two hundred three survivors without GH treatment (1.7%) developed CNS-SN, including 138 with meningioma, 49 with glioma, and 16 with other CNS-SNs. The adjusted rate ratio in GH-treated compared with untreated survivors for development of any CNS-SN was 1.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-1.8, P = .94], for meningiomas, 0.8 (95% CI 0.4-1.7, P = .61), and for gliomas, 1.9 (95% CI 0.7-4.8, P = .21). Factors associated with meningioma development included female gender (P = .001), younger age at primary cancer diagnosis (P < .001), and CRT/longer time since CRT (P < .001). Glioma was associated with CRT/shorter time since CRT (P < .001).There was no statistically significant increased overall risk of the occurrence of a CNS-SN associated with GH exposure. Specifically, occurrence of meningiomas and gliomas were not associated with GH treatment.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606096","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.784591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.683038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.44248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Growth hormone deficiency","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_deficiency"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.328847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.309577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Meningioma","weight":0.275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningioma"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.247891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.225773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.111569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0891297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
