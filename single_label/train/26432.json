{"id":26432,"title":"[Association of CMA1 gene tag single nucleotide polymorphisms with essential hypertension in Yi population from Yunnan].","abstract":"To assess the association of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) of chymase gene (CMA1) with essential hypertension in Yi population from Yunnan, China.A case-control study was carried out. Four tag SNPs(rs1956921, rs1800876, rs5244 and rs1885108) were genotyped in 303 patients with essential hypertension and 312 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism(PCR-RFLP) method.No significant difference in genotypic and allelic distributions of the four polymorphisms was detected between the two groups(P>0.05), and the same results existed in the females. The frequencies of rs1956921 C allele and a C-T haplotype constructed with rs1956921 and rs5244 were greater in male patients compared with male controls(P<0.01).The rs1956921 C allele of the CMA1 gene and the C-T haplotype constructed with rs1956921 and rs5244 may be risk factors for essential hypertension in ethnic Yi males from Yunnan.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25119908","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.823523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.752514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.543451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.172526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Yunnan","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Canadian Museums Association","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Museums_Association"},{"name":"Chymase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chymase"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"303","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/303"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Yi people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_people"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"}]}
