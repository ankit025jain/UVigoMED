{"id":29784,"title":"Gender differences between predictors of HIV status among PWID in Ukraine.","abstract":"The HIV epidemic in Ukraine is among the largest in Europe. While traditionally the epidemic has spread through injection risk behavior, sexual transmission is becoming more common. Previous research has found that women in Ukraine have higher rates of HIV and engage in more HIV risk behavior than men. This study extended that work by identifying risk factors that differentially predict men and women's HIV status among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Ukraine.From July 2010 to July 2013, 2480 sexually active PWID with unknown HIV status were recruited from three cities in Ukraine through street outreach. The average age was 31 years old.Women, who made up twenty-eight percent of the sample, had higher safe sex self-efficacy (p<.01) and HIV knowledge (p<.001) than men, but scored higher on both the risky injection (p<.001) and risky sex (p<.001) composite scores than men. Risky sex behaviors were associated with women's HIV status more than men's. We also report results identifying predictors of risky injection and sex behaviors.Gender-specific interventions could address problem of HIV risk among women who inject drugs in a country with a growing HIV epidemic. Our findings suggest specific ways in which intervention efforts might focus on groups and individuals who are at the highest risk of contracting HIV (or who are already HIV positive) to halt the spread of HIV in Ukraine.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613219","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Safe sex","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_sex"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.592888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.554854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.413163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.380173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"HIV-positive people","weight":0.243667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-positive_people"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.143404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Ukraine","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Street","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Train station","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Outreach","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outreach"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0125579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
