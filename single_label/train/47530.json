{"id":47530,"title":"Therapeutic effects of cationic hybrid liposomes on the hepatic metastasis of colon carcinoma along with apoptosis in vivo.","abstract":"Therapeutic effects of cationic hybrid liposomes (HL) composed of 87?mol% dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 5?mol% polyoxyethylene (21) dodecyl ether (C12(EO)21) and 8?mol% O,O'-ditetradecanoyl-N-(?-trimethyl-ammonioacetyl) diethanolamine chloride (2C14ECl) on the metastasis of human colon carcinoma (HCT116) cells were examined in vivo. Cationic HL having a hydrodynamic diameter less than 150?nm were preserved for one month. Therapeutic effects were obtained in the hepatic metastasis mouse models of HCT116 cells after the intravenous injection of cationic HL. The histological analysis indicated the induction of apoptosis in the liver section of the hepatic metastasis mouse models treated with cationic HL in vivo. Therapeutic effects of cationic HL without any drugs on the hepatic metastasis were revealed for the first time on the basis of histological analyses in vivo.
