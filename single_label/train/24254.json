{"id":24254,"title":"Predictive value of cerebrospinal fluid matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 concentrations in childhood bacterial meningitis.","abstract":"Increased concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in cerebrospinal fluid are part of the host response in bacterial meningitis (BM). We investigated whether the concentrations of MMP-9 and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 predict the outcome in childhood BM.Cerebrospinal fluid MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from 264 and 335 patients, respectively; 43 children without BM served as controls. The results were compared with previously known independent predictors of death and sequelae.Higher MMP-9 and TIMP-1 values distinguished the controls from the BM patients (P < 0.0001). A MMP-9 concentration >940 ng/mL proved an independent predictor of death [adjusted odds ratio: 4.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.09-7.77; P < 0.0001]. If the patient additionally presented with a Glasgow Coma Score below 9, the odds increased to 13.21 (95% CI: 5.44-32.08; P < 0.0001). TIMP-1 levels correlated with the severity of sequelae (?: 0.30; P < 0.0001), but not with death. Its concentration above 390 ng/mL increased the likelihood of sequelae 3.43-fold (95% CI: 1·73-6·79; P = 0.0004), and up to 31.18-fold (95% CI: 4.05-239.8; P = 0.0009) if the patient also presented a Glasgow Coma Score < 12.Elevated cerebrospinal fluid MMP-9 and TIMP-1 values predict 2 important outcomes in childhood BM. Combined with a clinical evaluation, quantification of these indices augments the chances to identify the patients in greatest need of better treatment modalities.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445831","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.905841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.750636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.505445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.368039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.103496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Bacterial meningitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_meningitis"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"264","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/264"},{"name":"335","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/335"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"940","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/940"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Total chances","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_chances"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"'Allo 'Allo!
