{"id":67232,"title":"Acute renal injury in liver transplant patients and its effect on patient survival.","abstract":"Acute renal injury is a common complication in liver transplant patients. Acute kidney injury is due to nephrotoxic drugs used after liver transplant, infections, and hemorrhage. Though it is generally reversible, it has effects on grafts and patients survival. In this retrospective observational study carried out at a single center, the effects of acute renal disease on liver recipient's survival were investigated.Liver transplant recipients of live-donor and deceased-donor transplants between January 2002 and May 2013 were included in this study; there were 310 liver transplant patients (mean age, 28 y; age range, 6 mo-62 y; 165 males, 145 females). The acute kidney disease diagnosis and staging was based on the nephrology department evaluation and daily serum creatinine levels. Patients with acute kidney injury before undergoing liver transplant and those undergoing a transplant for the second time were excluded. Kidney functions were evaluated by the nephrology department 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year after the liver transplant.Acute kidney disease rates in these patients were 5%, 8%, and 12%. Four patients developed chronic kidney failure during follow-up. The mortality rate was higher (18%) in acute renal failure patients compared with those that did not have acute renal failure. The mortality rate was 11% in patients without acute renal failure.Acute renal injury is common after liver transplant and has an effect on mortality.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635816","annotations":[{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.752284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.685203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.619043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.54584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.509238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Serum creatinine","weight":0.295655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_creatinine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.205451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
