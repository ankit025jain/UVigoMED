Chest radiographs were acquired under three exposure levels (4.0, 3.2 and 2.0 mAs) with an ISS-FPD and with CR. 5 thoracic radiologists evaluated 72 images for the presence or absence of a lesion over each of 6 areas. A total of 1296 observations were analysed in a receiver-operating characteristic analysis. A jackknife method was used for the statistical analysis.The areas under the curves (AUCs) for the detection of simulated honeycomb lung obtained with the ISS-FPD were significantly larger than those obtained with CR at all exposure conditions. For the detection of simulated ground-glass opacity and reticular opacity, there were no significant differences between the two systems. In addition, the AUCs for the detectability of simulated honeycomb lung obtained with the ISS-FPD at all exposure levels were significantly larger than those obtained with CR at 4 mAs.The ISS-FPD was superior to CR for the detection of simulated honeycomb lung. Provided that the chosen model is representative of interstitial pneumonia, the use of an ISS-FPD might reduce a patient's exposure dose during the detection of interstitial pneumonia.The ISS-FPD has shown its advantage compared with CR in the detection of honeycombing, one sign of interstitial pneumonia.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874767","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.800526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.715555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.566914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.404063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.242562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Computed radiography","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_radiography"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Resampling (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Anthropomorphism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.0169634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ghost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost"},{"name":"1296","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1296"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Smoke detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Superimposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superimposition"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Interstitial lung disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_lung_disease"},{"name":"Honeycomb","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb"}]}
