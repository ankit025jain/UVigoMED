{"id":87320,"title":"[The modern view on inside vehicle trauma].","abstract":"Forensic medical diagnostics of the injuries to the driver and passengers remains a challenging problem for forensic medical experts investigating traffic accidents. Specifically, the investigators encounter difficulties in the conduction of comprehensive medico-autotechnical studies. The objective of the present work was to propose the algorithm of actions for elucidating not only qualitative but also quantitative characteristics allowing to determine the position of both the driver and the front-seat passenger of the vehicle. This algorithm significantly improves the quality of expert judgment making it more objective and reliable.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269170","annotations":[{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.626519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.592859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.581414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.362268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.342662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Passenger","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger"},{"name":"Medical jurisprudence","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_jurisprudence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Judgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
