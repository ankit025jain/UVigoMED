{"id":46786,"title":"[New biologics for treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].","abstract":"The therapeutic options for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases have seen an enormous development over the last decades. However, there are several unmet needs which warrant the development of additional biologics for a better and complete control of the inflammatory process.Novel biological therapies that will be approved in the near future include blockade of the adhesion molecule integrin alpha4beta7 and the cytokine interleukin 23. Large phase III trials have established the clinical efficacy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, respectively. The development of biologic therapies in earlier stages includes additional antibodies that block adhesion molecules as well as biologics that intercept the interleukin 6 pathway.The therapeutic landscape in inflammatory bowel disease will be enriched by additional biologic therapies. Clinical studies should investigate the interaction with existing therapies, e.g. anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies and the development of new endpoints for a better disease control and for improved long-term outcome.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619099","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.581475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.511745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.389764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.350172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.331007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.285564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Interleukin 23","weight":0.270859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_23"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.186516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.167266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
