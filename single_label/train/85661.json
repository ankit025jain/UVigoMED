{"id":85661,"title":"Perioperative consideration of obstructive sleep apnea in ambulatory surgery.","abstract":"The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is increasing and a significant number of patients with OSA are undiagnosed. The suitability of ambulatory surgery in patients with OSA remains controversial, and the evidence regarding the safety of ambulatory surgery for patients with OSA is limited. Preoperative screening and careful selection of patients for ambulatory surgery is the most important step. Patients diagnosed and suspected of having OSA should be managed with a systematic algorithm to improve outcomes.
