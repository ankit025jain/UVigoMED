{"id":55722,"title":"Traditional and reduced recession surgical dosage for bilateral lateral rectus recession for infantile exotropia.","abstract":"To investigate the optimal surgical dose for treating infantile exotropia.In this retrospective study, clinical records of 44 children who had undergone bilateral lateral rectus recessions before 4 years of age for an exotropia present before 12 months of age were studied. Children had 1 year of follow-up after surgery. Patients were separated into those who had traditional surgery and those who received a reduced recession of their lateral recti.The traditional surgery group comprised 36% of the patients and the reduced recession group, 1-2 mm reduction in the recession, comprised 64% of the study group. There was borderline significance (p=0.074) when the postoperative angle of deviation was compared in the early postoperative period. The traditional group had a mean deviation of 5.25 prism dioptres (PD) of esodeviation compared with the reduced recession group having a 2.91 esodeviation. There was no statistical difference at the 1-year evaluation of the alignment. The traditional group had a mean exodeviation of 2.63 PD compared with the reduced recession group having a 2.91 PD exodeviation.Postoperative surgical outcome was not affected by a reduction in the amount of recession by 1-2 mm from traditional tables used for treatment of exotropia. Reducing the recession of the lateral recti reduces the risk of overcorrection in this sensory labile population.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825843","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.349146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.0415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Prism (optics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics)"},{"name":"Absolute deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_deviation"},{"name":"Lateral rectus muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Exotropia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotropia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"1 millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_millimetre"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Late-2000s financial crisis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Furniture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pseudobulbar affect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudobulbar_affect"}]}
