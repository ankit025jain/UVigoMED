{"id":91028,"title":"Penetration of Celect inferior vena cava filters: retrospective review of CT scans in 265 patients.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the prevalence and extent of Celect inferior vena cava (IVC) filter penetration.All patients with Celect filters who underwent CT between 2007 and 2012 were assessed for penetration and related complications.Of the 690 patients with Celect filters placed at our institution, 265 underwent CT for various reasons. The mean (SD) interval between filter placement and last CT was 167.8Â±264.8 days (median, 56 days; range, 0-1592 days). Penetration of primary leg was observed in 39% (95% CI, 29-51%) of patients within 30 days and 80% (95% CI, 70-87%) of patients within 90 days after placement. The mean number of penetrated legs per patient was 1.8 at 30 days and 2.1 at 90 days after placement. Penetration into adjacent organs occurred in 35 of 265 (13.2%) filters (in 45 IVC filter limbs); penetration into two structures occurred with 10 filters. The sites involved were the duodenum (n=22), aorta (n=9), psoas muscle (n=4), vertebral body (n=3), pancreas (n=2), adrenal gland (n=1), liver (n=1), right kidney (n=1), lymph node (n=1), and diaphragm (n=1). One patient presented with abdominal pain related to penetration.This study confirms a high penetration rate for Celect IVC filters and shows that CT can characterize the extent of leg penetration. Most cases of penetration were asymptomatic, but the likelihood of penetration increased over time.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555603","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.873641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Psoas major muscle","weight":0.756664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoas_major_muscle"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Body of vertebra","weight":0.526917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_vertebra"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava filter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava_filter"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
