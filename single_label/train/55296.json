{"id":55296,"title":"Adjustable sutures in children.","abstract":"Although adjustable sutures are considered a standard technique in adult strabismus surgery, most surgeons are hesitant to attempt the technique in children, who are believed to be unlikely to cooperate for postoperative assessment and adjustment. Interest in using adjustable sutures in pediatric patients has increased with the development of surgical techniques specific to infants and children. This workshop briefly reviews the literature supporting the use of adjustable sutures in children and presents the approaches currently used by three experienced strabismus surgeons.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924284","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.673635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.603324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.250192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Workshop","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Strabismus surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus_surgery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"}]}
