{"id":65381,"title":"Comparison between clinical significance of serum proinflammatory protein interleukin-6 and classic tumor markers total PSA, free PSA and free/total PSA prior to prostate biopsy.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to clarify whether serum levels of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) could be a useful marker in prostate diseases. Serum IL-6 was determined prior to prostate biopsy procedure in 82 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa), 25 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 24 patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and 17 patients with chronic prostatitis. Serum IL-6 levels were compared with total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA) and the free/total ratio (f/tPSA) serum levels. Statistically significant difference was not found in serum IL-6 levels among the four groups (p = 0.088). However, the patients with poorly differentiated PCa with Gleason score (GS) 4 + 3 = 7 and > 7 had significantly higher serum IL-6 levels than the patients with moderately differentiated PCa with GS 3 + 4 = 7 and < 7 (p = 0.007). The findings suggest that serum IL-6 level might be a potentially useful marker for poorly differentiated PCa.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851609","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.872009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatic_intraepithelial_neoplasia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.81482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.614106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.595769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.215403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Chronic bacterial prostatitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_bacterial_prostatitis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
