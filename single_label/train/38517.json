{"id":38517,"title":"Root stabilization of the repaired bicuspid aortic valve: subcommissural annuloplasty versus root reimplantation.","abstract":"At our institution, type I bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients with aortic insufficiency (AI) who are candidates for valve preservation are stratified into two groups by aortic root pathology: nonaneurysmal root undergoing primary cusp repair+subcommissural annuloplasty (repair group) vs aneurysmal root undergoing primary cusp repair+root reimplantation (reimplantation group). We report outcomes of this surgical reconstructive strategy for the repaired type I BAV.A retrospective review was performed of 71 patients with a type I BAV undergoing primary valve repair from 2005 to 2012. The repair group (n=40) underwent annular stabilization by subcommissural annuloplasty, and the reimplantation group (n=31) underwent robust annular stabilization provided by root reimplantation.Preoperative characteristics and root anatomy were similar, except for increased root dimensions in the reimplantation group (p<0.001). Mortality, stroke, valve reoperation, and pacemaker requirement were zero in both groups. Postoperative peak (19±10 vs 11±5 mm Hg, p<0.001) and mean gradients (10±5 vs 5±3 mm Hg, p<0.001) favored root reimplantation. Freedom from AI greater than 1+ was 100% in both groups. Mean follow-up was 40 months in the reimplantation group and 38 months in the repair group. At 5 years, overall survival was 100% in both groups. Freedom from aortic reoperation and AI exceeding 2+ were similar in both groups. Freedom from AI exceeding 1+ was significantly better in the reimplantation group (92%±6% vs 62%±10%, p=0.03). The 2-year peak (14±6 vs 19±9 mm Hg, p=0.009) and mean (7±4 vs 11±5 mm Hg, p=0.001) gradients favored root reimplantation.Root stabilization with the reimplantation technique significantly improves the durability of the repaired type I BAV compared with subcommissural annuloplasty. It also provides improved and sustained valve mobility (transvalvular gradients).","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418204","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.797443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Aortic insufficiency","weight":0.795841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.700925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.636749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.620087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.575314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.553023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Bicuspid aortic valve","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicuspid_aortic_valve"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.242587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.194581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"926","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/926"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Annulus (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc annuloplasty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc_annuloplasty"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Heart valve repair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve_repair"}]}
