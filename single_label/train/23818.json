{"id":23818,"title":"An insight on bacterial cellular targets of photodynamic inactivation.","abstract":"The emergence of microbial resistance is becoming a global problem in clinical and environmental areas. As such, the development of drugs with novel modes of action will be vital to meet the threats created by the rise in microbial resistance. Microbial photodynamic inactivation is receiving considerable attention for its potentialities as a new antimicrobial treatment. This review addresses the interactions between photosensitizers and bacterial cells (binding site and cellular localization), the ultrastructural, morphological and functional changes observed at initial stages and during the course of photodynamic inactivation, the oxidative alterations in specific molecular targets, and a possible development of resistance.
