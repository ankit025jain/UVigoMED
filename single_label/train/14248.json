{"id":14248,"title":"Methylglyoxal, a reactive glucose metabolite, increases renin angiotensin aldosterone and blood pressure in male Sprague-Dawley rats.","abstract":"The majority of people with diabetes develop hypertension along with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Methylglyoxal, a reactive glucose metabolite, is elevated in diabetic patients. We investigated the effects of methylglyoxal on the renin-angiotensin system and blood pressure.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a continuous infusion of methylglyoxal with a minipump for 4 weeks. Organs/tissues and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were used for molecular studies. High-performance liquid chromatography, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to measure methylglyoxal, proteins, and mRNA, respectively. Small interfering RNA for angiotensinogen and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) were used to study mechanisms.Methylglyoxal-treated rats developed a significant increase in blood pressure and plasma levels of aldosterone, renin, angiotensin, and catecholamines. Methylglyoxal level and protein and mRNA for angiotensin, AT1 receptor, adrenergic ?1D receptor, and renin were significantly increased in the aorta and/or kidney of methylglyoxal-treated rats, a novel finding. Alagebrium attenuated the above effects of methylgloyxal. Treatment of cultured VSMCs with methylglyoxal or high glucose (25 mM) significantly increased cellular methylglyoxal and protein and mRNA for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B), angiotensin, AT1 receptor, and ?1D receptor, which were prevented by inhibition of NF-?B, and by alagebrium. Silencing of mRNA for RAGE prevented the increase in NF-kB induced by methylglyoxal. Silencing of mRNA for angiotensinogen prevented the increase in NF-?B, angiotensin, AT1 receptor, and ?1D receptor.Methylglyoxal activates NF-?B through RAGE and thereby increases renin-angiotensin levels, a novel finding, and a probable mechanism of increase in blood pressure.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal
