{"id":46282,"title":"Hepatic yttrium-90 radioembolization for metastatic melanoma: a single-center experience.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to analyze the safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization in the treatment of unresectable hepatic melanoma metastases refractory to previous systemic/locoregional therapy. Between February 2004 and April 2010, 16 patients with hepatic melanoma metastases (ocular=7, skin=4, other sites=5) were treated with (90)Y radioembolization at a single center. Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria, version 3.0. Response to therapy was assessed by size and necrosis criteria. Progression-free survival (hepatic) and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median dose to the treatment site was 108.57 Gy. Grade 1 and 2 clinical toxicities included fatigue (44%), nausea (19%), and vomiting (12%). Grade 3 absolute lymphocyte toxicity and aspartate aminotransferase toxicity were noted in 2 (12%) and 1 (7%) patients, respectively. Grade 4 bilirubin toxicity was observed in 1 (7%) patient. Overall, 13 (81%) patients showed disease control (response+stable disease) according to WHO, European Association for the Study of the Liver, and Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors. Progressive disease was observed in 3 (19%) patients according to WHO, European Association for the Study of the Liver, and Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors. The median overall and hepatic progression-free survival times were 7.63 and 4.23 months. Patients with disease control (responders+stable disease) survived longer than those with progressive disease (9.97 vs. 2.13 months, P<0.0001). Results from this small and single-center experience show that radioembolization is a safe therapy and its potential for being an efficacious therapy for hepatic melanoma metastases should be explored further. Radioembolization should be considered for liver-dominant disease refractory to other forms of systemic therapies.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24638152","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.869195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"National Cancer Institute","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.797888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.786849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.732642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.657905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.517041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.404244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Yttrium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
