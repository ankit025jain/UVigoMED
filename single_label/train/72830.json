{"id":72830,"title":"SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes in melanocyte differentiation and melanoma.","abstract":"Epidermal melanocytes are pigment-producing cells derived from the neural crest that protects skin from the damaging effects of solar radiation. Malignant melanoma, a highly aggressive cancer, arises from melanocytes. SWI/SNF enzymes are multiprotein complexes that remodel chromatin structure and have extensive roles in cellular differentiation. Components of the complex have been found to be mutated or lost in several human cancers. This review focuses on studies that implicate SWI/SNF enzymes in melanocyte differentiation and in melanoma.
