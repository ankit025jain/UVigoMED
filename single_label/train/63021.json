{"id":63021,"title":"Azacitidine salvage therapy for relapse of myeloid malignancies following allogeneic hematopoietic SCT.","abstract":"Patients with hematopoietic malignancies relapsing after allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (allo-HSCT) have a poor prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed the patients who received azacitidine in our center in the course of treatment of their post-transplant relapse. We identified 31 patients. Relapse occurred at a median of 3.7 (1.7-37.6) months following allo-HSCT. Patients received a median number of three cycles (1-12) of azacitidine (7 days, 75 mg/m(2) daily). Thirty-nine percent of patients had either a monosomal karyotype or a complex karyotype. Eleven patients (35%) received at least one DLI. Eleven patients responded to azacitidine, with four patients achieving a CR (13%). Median time to best response was 92 (35-247) days, with a median duration of 209 (64-751) days. One-year estimated survival rate was 14%. In conclusion, azacitidine may reinduce durable remissions in very few patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome. The toxicity related to azacitidine was high, although it may be difficult to distinguish between treatment-related side effects, namely due to cytopenia and toxicity due to the relapse or disease progression itself. Early administration of azacitidine after transplant followed by DLI should be considered as a pre-emptive therapy for potential relapse in patients with minimal residual disease or high-risk myeloid malignancies.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488048","annotations":[{"name":"Azacitidine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azacitidine"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Cytopenia","weight":0.884591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopenia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Salvage therapy","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvage_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.285833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.256073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.173608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0200776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Old Delhi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Delhi"},{"name":"Preemption (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Best response","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_response"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Boeing 737","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
