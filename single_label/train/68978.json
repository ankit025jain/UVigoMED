{"id":68978,"title":"Association between endotoxin activity and acute kidney injury in cardiac patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.","abstract":"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been thought to promote endotoxin translocation from the gut. Increased endotoxin activity (EA) has been related to a worsening of organ dysfunction, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aims to determine if CPB could influence EA after cardiac surgery, and if EA variations are associated with renal dysfunction following CPB.This was an observational study of patients subjected to complex cardiac surgery, likely to last for >120 min. Blood samples were obtained before, during and after CPB for EA analysis. AKI occurrence defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria was evaluated.Eighteen patients were enrolled. EA significantly increased after 12 h following CPB. Variations of EA from baseline were significantly associated with variations of creatinine, i.e. AKI.Complex cardiac surgery requiring long CPB promotes EA increases that could be associated with variations of serum creatinine and AKI occurrence.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481286","annotations":[{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.676438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.668541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.654802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.616647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.475405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.394638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.135579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"}]}
