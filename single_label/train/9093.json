{"id":9093,"title":"G-protein coupled receptor 124 (GPR124) in endothelial cells regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced tumor angiogenesis.","abstract":"G protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124; also called tumor endothelial marker 5, TEM5) is highly expressed in tumor vasculature. While recent studies have revealed a role in vasculogenesis, evidence for GPR124 function in tumor angiogenesis is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that GPR124 is required for VEGF-induced tumor angiogenesis. GPR124 silencing in human endothelial cells inhibited mouse xenograft tumor angiogenic vessel formation and tumor growth. GPR124 regulated VEGF-induced tumor angiogenic processes in vitro including cell-cell interaction, permeability, migration, invasion, and tube formation. Therefore, GPR124 plays a key role in VEGF-induced tumor angiogenesis.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730523","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Vasculogenesis","weight":0.694157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculogenesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.655169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.543093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.200394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0340852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
