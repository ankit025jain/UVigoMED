{"id":55453,"title":"The association of blood pressure and primary open-angle glaucoma: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between blood pressure levels and hypertension with primary open-angle glaucoma and intraocular pressure endpoints.Systematic review with quantitative meta-analysis.Studies were identified by searching the PubMed and EMBASE databases. Inverse-variance weighted random-effects models were used to summarize relative risks. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were used to explore potential sources of heterogeneity across studies.Sixty observational studies were included. The pooled relative risk for primary open-angle glaucoma comparing patients with hypertension to those without hypertension was 1.16 (95% CI = 1.05-1.28), with modest heterogeneity across studies (I(2) 34.5%). Virtually all studies reported a positive association between blood pressure and intraocular pressure (IOP). The pooled average increase in IOP associated with a 10 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure was 0.26 mm Hg (95% CI 0.23-0.28, I(2) 30.7%), and the average increase associated with a 5 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure was 0.17 mm Hg (95% CI 0.11-0.23, I(2) 90.5%).In this meta-analysis, hypertension was associated with increased intraocular pressure. The association between hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma was stronger in cross-sectional compared with case-control and longitudinal studies. Our findings support a role of increased blood pressure in elevated intraocular pressure and possibly in the development of glaucoma.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879946","annotations":[{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.816307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.720181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.623827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.599312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.561886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.493147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.417666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.28548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0387277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Systematic (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_(band)"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Ocular hypertension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_hypertension"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
