{"id":31025,"title":"Hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin: clinical features and risk factors.","abstract":"Oxaliplatin-based regimens induce a potential risk of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), with incidence varying from 10% to 25% and lack of clearly identified risk factors. The present study aimed to assess incidence and risk factors in HSR.All patients treated with oxaliplatin in the Medical Oncology Department of the Lyon Sud University Hospital (Hospices Civils de Lyon, France) from October 2004 to January 2011 were enrolled. Incidence and severity of HSR were analyzed retrospectively and the potential clinicopathological covariates were tested on univariate and multivariate analysis.A total of 1,221 doses of oxaliplatin were administered for 191 patients, 8.9% of whom experienced an HSR. Seventeen HSRs were observed, with 1.6% grade 3 and no grade 4 events. The first reaction appeared after a median of 3 oxaliplatin infusions. Using univariate analysis, HSR was associated with younger age (mean age, 56.2 years; p = 0.04), female gender (p = 0.01) and prior exposure to platinum salts (p = 0.02). No increased risk was associated with mean dose or with presence of atopic background. Multivariate analysis confirmed that women were at higher risk of oxaliplatin HSR than men (p < 0.05). Reintroduction of oxaliplatin was effective in 64.7% of hypersensitive patients using an appropriate premedication strategy. Patients who experienced a grade 3 HSR were not rechallenged.The risk of developing oxaliplatin HSR should not be underestimated (8.9% of patients). The medical team's vigilance should be increased with women, younger patients and patients with prior exposure to platinum salts.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417770","annotations":[{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.717984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.658821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.520754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"France","weight":0.441888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.305493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.153104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Salt (chemistry)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0471213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Premedication","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premedication"},{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lyon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.0225798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Boston University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Fourth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_grade"},{"name":"Sud (Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg constituency)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sud_(Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Luxembourg_constituency)"},{"name":"Hospices de Beaune","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospices_de_Beaune"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Reintroduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reintroduction"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"}]}
