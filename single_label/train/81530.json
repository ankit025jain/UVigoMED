{"id":81530,"title":"[Cytokines level in patients with drug-induced jaw necrosis].","abstract":"The study included 15 patients with purulent inflammatory diseases of maxillofacial area and 25 patients with facial bone necrosis induced by synthetic drugs. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines levels in saliva and wound fluid were analyzed in two groups. The results proved cytokines to play important role in jaw necrosis induced by drugs containing red phosphorus.
