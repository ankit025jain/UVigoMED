{"id":91479,"title":"[New anterolateral approach of distal femur for treatment of distal femoral fractures].","abstract":"To assess the effectiveness of the new anterolateral approach of the distal femur for the treatment of distal femoral fractures.Between July 2007 and December 2009, 58 patients with distal femoral fractures were treated by new anterolateral approach of the distal femur in 28 patients (new approach group) and by conventional approach in 30 patients (conventional approach group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, cause of injury, affected side, type of fracture, disease duration, complication, or preoperative intervention (P > 0.05). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy frequency, hospitalization days, and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score of knee were recorded.Operation was successfully completed in all patients of 2 groups, and healing of incision by first intention was obtained; no vascular and nerves injuries occurred. The operation time and intraoperative fluoroscopy frequency of new approach group were significantly less than those of conventional approach group (P < 0.05). But the intraoperative blood loss and the hospitalization days showed no significant difference between 2 groups (P > 0.05). All patients were followed up 12-36 months (mean, 19.8 months). Bone union was shown on X-ray films; the fracture healing time was (12.62 +/- 2.34) weeks in the new approach group and was (13.78 +/- 1.94) weeks in the conventional approach group, showing no significant difference (t=2.78, P=0.10). The knee HSS score at last follow-up was 94.4 +/- 4.2 in the new approach group, and was 89.2 +/- 6.0 in the conventional approach group, showing significant difference between 2 groups (t=3.85, P=0.00).New anterolateral approach of the distal femur for distal femoral fractures has the advantages of exposure plenitude, minimal tissue trauma, and early function rehabilitation training so as to enhance the function recovery of knee joint.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501885","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.723856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.63381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.508905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.497478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.155994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0783418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
