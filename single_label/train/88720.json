{"id":88720,"title":"[Foreign body in parotid gland: a case report].","abstract":"A 44-year-old male complained recurrent swelling and pain in the left pre-auricular mass over 4 years, which aggravated for 4 months. Ultrasonography revealed a mixed mass echo in the left parotid gland. Computed tomography showed an enlarged parotid gland and a 1.5 cm x 0.9 cm low density shadow in the superficial lobe area with strip high-density shadow in the edge. Although the facial nerves of the patient were found adhered to the foreign body during the operation, the foreign body in parotid gland was removed surgically without any injure to them due to facial nerves protection. In conclusion, facial nerves dissection is necessary to avoid the postsurgical facial paralysis in the surgical removal of foreign bodies in parotid gland.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800550","annotations":[{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.93303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.647546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.50717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.322371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.31123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Echo (phenomenon)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(phenomenon)"},{"name":"Aggravation (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggravation_(law)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Shadow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 44","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_44"},{"name":"Facial nerve paralysis","weight":0.0128775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve_paralysis"}]}
