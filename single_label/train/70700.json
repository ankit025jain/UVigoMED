{"id":70700,"title":"[Influence of I2PP2A gene silencing by RNA interference on proliferation and apoptosis of human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4-R1].","abstract":"To explore the effect of RNA interference of human I2PP2A gene on the proliferation and apoptosis of retinoic acid-resistant human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4-R1.Designed and constructed a RNA interference lentiviral vector I2PP2A-shRNA which targeted against I2PP2A gene, then transfected it into NB4-R1 via polybrene mediation. The I2PP2A expression levels before and after transfection were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Meanwhile, the proliferation and apoptosis rates of each group were determined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay. The protein expressions of caspase-8 and PARP were detected by Western blot.Both qRT-PCR and Western blot data showed the I2PP2A expression level was significantly downregulated in the transfection group. The I2PP2A mRNA expression level decreased by (70.0 ± 9.6)% and (64.0 ± 6.2)% respectively, compared with blank control and negative control group, and the I2PP2A protein expression level showed a consistent trend. CCK-8 proliferation assay indicated the NB4-R1 cell proliferation rate in I2PP2A-shRNA transfection group significantly reduced compared to blank control group (P<0.05). Flow cytometry results showed that NB4-R1 apoptosis rate in I2PP2A-shRNA transfection group increased by (6.30 ± 0.67) times and (6.04 ± 0.56) times, respectively (P<0.01). After inhibition of I2PP2A, the total caspase-8 and total PARP expressions decreased by (44.0 ± 3.1)% and (57.0 ± 4.0)%, respectively; Meanwhile, the cleaved caspase-8 (p43) and cleaved PARP (p89) increased by (36.0 ± 2.5)% and (45.0 ± 4.8)%, respectively compared with blank control group (P<0.05).I2PP2A gene silenced by RNA interference could inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of NB4-R1, which may be regulated through caspase-8-induced exogenous apoptosis pathway.","date":"2014-08-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152123","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.891569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.529215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute promyelocytic leukemia","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_promyelocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.434561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.374442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.10613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0651226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
