{"id":23769,"title":"Effect of empiric antibiotic treatment on plasma endotoxin activity in septic patients.","abstract":"Efficient empiric antibiotic therapy remains the cornerstone of sepsis treatment. However, antibiotics could be responsible for the transient clinical deterioration provoked by the release of bacterial cell-wall constituents, such as endotoxin, into the blood stream. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a transient elevation of endotoxin level occurred in septic patients following antibiotic administration.Thirty-three septic intensive care unit (ICU) patients were enrolled in this prospective trial. Four blood samples were collected from each of these patients during a 24-h period, and endotoxin activity was measured in these samples by the chemiluminescence technique. Fifteen ICU non-septic patients and 15 healthy volunteers were also observed for possible daily fluctuations in endotoxin activity.There was no significant increase in endotoxin levels following the initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy in septic patients. A clinical deterioration in the 4 h following antibiotic administration was observed in 14 septic patients (42 %). These patients had significantly higher endotoxin levels than stable septic patients.Although endotoxin levels failed to increase after the administration of antibiotic(s) to critically ill patients, they were higher in the septic patients presenting a transient deterioration than in the other patients. This observation suggests that a possible release of endotoxin due to bacteria lysis by antibiotics could be responsible for the observed clinical deterioration.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470321","annotations":[{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.8371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.767573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.732756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.648091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.630436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Chemiluminescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cornerstone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone"},{"name":"Electoral district","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district"},{"name":"Efficient (horse)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_(horse)"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
