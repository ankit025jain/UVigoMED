{"id":46130,"title":"Variation in access to the liver transplant waiting list in the United States.","abstract":"We sought to compare liver transplant waiting list access by demographics and geography relative to the pool of potential liver transplant candidates across the United States using a novel metric of access to care, termed a liver wait-listing ratio (LWR).We calculated LWRs from national liver transplant registration data and liver mortality data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the National Center for Healthcare Statistics from 1999 to 2006 to identify variation by diagnosis, demographics, geography, and era.Among patients with ALF and CLF, African Americans had significantly lower access to the waiting list compared with whites (acute: 0.201 versus 0.280; pre-MELD 0.201 versus 0.290; MELD era: 0.201 versus 0.274; all, P<0.0001) (chronic: 0.084 versus 0.163; pre-MELD 0.085 versus 0.179; MELD 0.084 versus 0.154; all, P<0.0001). Hispanics and whites had similar LWR in both eras (both P>0.05). In the MELD era, female subjects had greater access to the waiting list compared with male subjects (acute: 0.428 versus 0.154; chronic: 0.158 versus 0.140; all, P<0.0001). LWRs varied by three-fold by state (pre-MELD acute: 0.122-0.418, chronic: 0.092-0.247; MELD acute: 0.121-0.428, chronic: 0.092-0.243).The marked inequity in early access to liver transplantation underscores the need for local and national policy initiatives to affect this disparity.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646768","annotations":[{"name":"Death","weight":0.658002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.592034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.320546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.306626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.286841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.147858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.131144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0637772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"ALF (TV series)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALF_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"International Criminal Court","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court"},{"name":"1220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1220"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"1210","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1210"},{"name":"428","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/428"},{"name":"247","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"National Policy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Policy"},{"name":"Common Log Format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Metric system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system"},{"name":"Licensure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensure"},{"name":"Uncial 085","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_085"},{"name":"Light water reactor","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_water_reactor"}]}
