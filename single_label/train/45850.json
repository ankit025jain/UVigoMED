{"id":45850,"title":"Cystic artery pseudoaneurysm presenting as a complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy treated with percutaneous thrombin injection.","abstract":"A 45-year-old woman status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3years ago presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopy revealed hemobilia. Computed tomographic abdomen demonstrated a 2-cm aneurysm in the gall bladder fossa, consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. Initially, transcatheter coil embolization was attempted but recanalization of the aneurysm with recurrent bleeding in 2 days ensued. The aneurysm was then accessed percutaneously under ultrasound guidance and thrombin was injected into the aneurysm with subsequent complete thrombosis of the aneurysm and cessation of bleeding.
