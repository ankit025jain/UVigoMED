{"id":77010,"title":"Mannose-binding lectin gene polymorphism and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women.","abstract":"Inflammatory responses may be altered in postmenopausal women and predispose to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Genetic factors can also influence susceptibility to CVD. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a component of the innate immune system and an activator of the complement cascade. We evaluated the association of genetic polymorphism of MBL (MBL2) on risk factors for CVD in postmenopausal women.In this cross-sectional study, 311 Brazilian women (age ?45 years and amenorrhea ?12 months) were included.presence of previous or current CVD, insulin dependent diabetes, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Clinical, anthropometric and biochemical assessments were performed to evaluate the cardiovascular risk factors. DNA was extracted from buccal cell and polymorphisms at codons 54 and 57 in the MBL2 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For statistical analysis, the chi-square and logistic regression (odds ratio, OR) were used.The presence of the polymorphic allele for codon 54 was found in 25.8% of women (A/B=22.6%, B/B=3.2%) and for codon 57 in 12.2% (A/C=10.8%, C/C=1.4%). The polymorphism at codon 54 was significantly associated with the presence of hypertension (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.99, p=0.044) and insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.91, p=0.025). No significant associations were observed between the polymorphism at codon 57 with risk factors for CVD.In postmenopausal women, the polymorphism at codon 54 of the MBL2 was associated with lower risk for hypertension and insulin resistance that are important risk factors for CVD.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
