{"id":25430,"title":"Use of bivalirudin for anticoagulation during implantation of total artificial heart.","abstract":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia presents a challenge for anticoagulation techniques during cardiac surgery and ventricular assist device implantation. Bivalirudin is currently recommended for use during cardiopulmonary bypass for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but requires the use of special techniques to avoid blood stagnation. We report the successful use of bivalirudin during cardiopulmonary bypass for implantation of the Total Artificial Heart with late operative bleeding likely resulting from heavy cell saver use.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25208436","annotations":[{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.872664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Artificial heart","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_heart"},{"name":"Ventricular assist device","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_assist_device"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.458448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.430368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.392913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"}]}
