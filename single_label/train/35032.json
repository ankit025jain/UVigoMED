{"id":35032,"title":"[Diastematomyelia diagnosed prenatally].","abstract":"We report a case of a 32-week-old foetus affected by diastematomyelia. A third trimester echography suggested a spine abnormality. Further investigations by CT-scanner and MRI were performed to precise the anomaly and to better counsel the couple on the prognosis. We performed a review of the literature about embryological hypotheses, clinical presentations, antenatal investigations and prognosis of such a rare spinal malformation.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683841","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.803577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Embryology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.518123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.254836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.211952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Third trimester","weight":0.0481939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_trimester"},{"name":"Lawyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer"}]}
