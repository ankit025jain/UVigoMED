{"id":45861,"title":"Association among lifestyle, clinical examination, polymorphisms in CDH1 gene and Traditional Chinese Medicine syndrome differentiation of gastric cancer.","abstract":"To explore the association among life-style, clinical examination, polymorphisms in CDH1 gene and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation of gastric cancer (GC).A hospital-based population of 387 GC patients was investigated in Jiangsu province. Relevant information regarding lifestyle and clinical examination were collected by a standard questionnaire. Four known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CDH1 were investigated by polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction methods. Statistical analysis was conducted by SPSS 16.0 software.The results showed that meal duration and the status of glutamic pyruvic transaminase were significantly associated with TCM syndrome differentiation of GC (both P < 0.05). None of the four SNPs in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene achieved significant differences in their distributions among the nine syndrome types of GC (both P > 0.05). However, significant differences were observed in rs13689 genotype distributions between several pairs of syndrome types of GC, suggesting that rs13689 is correlated with the syndrome differentiation of GC.Integrated analysis of lifestyle, clinical examination and CDH1 gene polymorphisms can contribute to a better understanding of the GC syndrome types and may improve the efficacy of interventions by stratifying disease according to TCM criteria.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Digestive System
