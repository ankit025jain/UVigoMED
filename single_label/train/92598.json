{"id":92598,"title":"P53 dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is required for dexamethasone-induced death of osteoblasts.","abstract":"Prolonged or overdose glucocorticoids (GCs) usage is the common cause of osteoporosis. In the present study, we studied the cellular mechanism of dexamethasone (Dex)-induce osteoblast cell death by focusing on the role of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). In cultured osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, Dex-induced mPTP opening, which was demonstrated by mitochondrial membrane potential (MPP) decrease, cyclophilin-D (CyPD)-adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT-1) mitochondrial complexation and cytochrome C (cyto-C) release. The mPTP inhibitor sanglifehrin A (SfA) dramatically inhibited Dex-induced MPP loss, cyto-C release and MC3T3-E1 cell death. Dex-induced cell death requires mPTP composing protein CyPD, as CyPD inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and CyPD siRNA knockdown inhibited Dex-induced MC3T3-E1 cell death, while CyPD overexpression aggravated Dex's cytotoxic effect. We found that Dex induced P53 phosphorylation and translocation to mitochondria, where it formed a complex with CyPD. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) siRNA knockdown, or P53 inhibition (by its inhibitor pifithrin-? or shRNA silencing) suppressed Dex-induced CyPD-P53 mitochondrial association and subsequent MC3T3-E1 cell death. Finally, in primary cultured osteoblasts, Dex-induced cell death was inhibited by CsA, SfA or pifithrin-?. Together, our data suggest that Dex-induced osteoblast cell death is associated with GR-P53-regulated mPTP opening.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615518","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Osteoblast","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid receptor","weight":0.869607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid_receptor"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Cytochrome c","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.797516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.705784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.555951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.459703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.442862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.363254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mitochondrial permeability transition pore","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_permeability_transition_pore"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.193727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.176748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.158563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Sweat gland","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.108815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"3T3 cells","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3T3_cells"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
