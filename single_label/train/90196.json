{"id":90196,"title":"[Investigation of multyphytoadaptogene anti-radiation efficacy in dogs experiments].","abstract":"The purpose of the work was to elucidate the radioprotective efficacy of multyphytoadaptogene (MPA) in dogs in various conditions of gamma radiation and MPA application. Dogs were given 15% MPA solution with drinking water in 3,6 ml/kg dose per day 2 weeks before the radiating (preventive application), 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the radiating (preventive and therapeutic application) as well as 2 weeks after the radiating only (therapeutic application). Animals of control groups received radiation. Dogs were exposed to 3,5 Cy acute radiation and 8,0 Gy prolonged radiation. There were no survived dogs in control groups. At the same time MPA increased dogs survival in preventive, preventive and therapeutic as well as therapeutic applications after 3,5 Gy acute radiation and after 8,0 Gy prolonged radiation. MPA improved the somatic state, interfere with leukocytes amount in blood. The data obtained suggest the radioprotective efficacy of MPA.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640775","annotations":[{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.795537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.790162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.608539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.523914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.456219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.452922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.382056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0652231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"}]}
