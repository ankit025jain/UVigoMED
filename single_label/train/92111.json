{"id":92111,"title":"Neural and muscular mechanisms of electrically induced fatigue in patients with spinal cord injury.","abstract":"Intervention study.The present study aimed at examining whether spinal and/or peripheral alterations are in the origin of neuromuscular fatigue development induced by intermittent neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in subjects with complete spinal cord injury (SCI).Neurological Rehabilitation Center CMN Propara, Montpellier, France.Thirteen volunteers with complete SCI participated in the study. The right triceps surae muscle was fatigued using a 30-Hz NMES protocol (2?s ON-2?s OFF) composed of three series of five trains. Spinal excitability (assessed by the H-reflex), muscle excitability (assessed by the M-wave), muscle contractile properties (assessed by mechanical response parameters) and torque evoked by NMES were tested before and after each five-train series.NMES-evoked torque significantly decreased throughout the protocol (P<0.001). This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in M-wave amplitude (P<0.001), whereas H-reflex and the Hmax/Mmax ratio were not significantly modified. The amplitude of the mechanical response was significantly decreased at the end of the protocol (P<0.05).The results indicate significant fatigue development, which was attributed to impaired cross-bridge force-generating capacity, without modification of spinal excitability nor muscle excitability.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445970","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.879672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.837436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.584424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Triceps surae muscle","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_surae_muscle"},{"name":"France","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Triceps brachii muscle","weight":0.301787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_brachii_muscle"},{"name":"Electrical muscle stimulation","weight":0.276701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_muscle_stimulation"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.249069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Functional electrical stimulation","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.150996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Sliding filament model","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_filament_model"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Montpellier","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Ontario","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
