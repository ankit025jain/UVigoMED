{"id":31011,"title":"[Papulovesicular exanthem after a safari in South Africa].","abstract":"A 68-year-old man presented with a papulovesicular exanthem, fever and malaise after a safari in South Africa. Based on the history, the typical clinical picture with an exanthema and eschar as well as the detection of antibodies against rickettsioses of the spotted fever group, we diagnosed African tick-bite fever which is due to R. africae. During treatment with doxycycline 200 mg/d, all symptoms resolved completely within 11 days. Rickettsioses should always be considered in patients presenting with exanthema, fever and malaise. Particularly the presence of one or multiple eschars on the skin manifesting as erythematous plaques with central necrosis is a pathognomic sign. The serological detection of antibodies against rickettsia species of the spotted fever group is the established diagnostic standard. Due to extensive cross-reactions it is not possible to distinguish between the members of one rickettsial group. Furthermore antibody titers rise late in the disease, frequently 2 or 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. This underscores the importance of the clinical diagnosis.
