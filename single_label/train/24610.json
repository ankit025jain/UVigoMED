{"id":24610,"title":"[The influence of knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors for 1st and 6th year medical students' lifestyle].","abstract":"The most important way to reduce the incidence of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevention, which should include modification of risk factors.To define knowledge of primary CVD prevention, and to rate compliance with prevention rules among students'.The study included 275 first year (ly) students and 161 sixth year (6y) students of the Faculty of Medicine (303 Females and 133 Males; aged 18-29 years). Anonymous questionnaire on acquaintance with the primary prevention, compliance with it and correct values and units of blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol level was conducted among survey participants.6y students indicated risk factors of CVD significantly more correctly than ly students. The proper value of male and female waist circumference was indicated correctly more often by 6y students than ly students. When compared to ly students, 6y students more often marked properly the heart attack symptoms, tests which are necessary to diagnose ACS, and markers of the myocardial necrosis. Respectively, among the ly and 6y students the mean BMI was: 20.82 kg/m2 vs. 21, 74 kg/m2, mean waist circumference: 70.00 cm vs.74.81 cm. 6y students more often than ly students eat regular meals, eat fruits and vegetables more than 4 times a week, exercise more than 30 minutes a day.Sixth year medical students' knowledge about the prevention of CVD is greater than the first year students' but still is unsatisfactory. Sixth year students slightly often follow the rules of primary prevention than first year students.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25338335","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.843035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.793617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.249922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.19474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Medical education","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"American Chemical Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chemical_Society"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Light-year","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"}]}
