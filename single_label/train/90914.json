{"id":90914,"title":"Which patients undergo a surgical reintervention following a distal radius fracture?","abstract":"Not all malunited distal radius fractures cause pain or functional impairment, and only few patients require a surgical correction or a salvage procedure. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate differences between 38 patients who underwent a reintervention and 65 patients who did not. The only discriminative variable in the current study was age : 46 years in the reintervention group versus 59 years in the non-reintervention group (p < 0.0001). Differences in gender or type of malunion were not significant, and thus not discriminative. It can be concluded that patient age may be more often associated with a reintervention than gender or radiological characteristics of wrist fractures.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563968","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.754652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.625719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.509266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.49663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.354458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.15004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.0421175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
