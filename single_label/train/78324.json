{"id":78324,"title":"Headaches caused by nasal and paranasal sinus disease.","abstract":"Headache and rhinosinusitis are 2 of the most common conditions seen in clinical practice. In general, chronic and disabling headaches, especially if migraine features are present, are not due to sinus abnormalities. In suspected cases of bacterial sinusitis, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are both effective in demonstrating the infection. Although most cases of sinusitis are fairly easy to diagnose, sphenoid sinusitis may be overlooked, and can present with progressive or thunderclap headache in adults. Contact-point headache should be considered in patients with focal headaches and a contact point on the lateral nasal wall.
