{"id":91591,"title":"[Treatment of intertrochanteric fractures over age of 80 years old patients with proximal femur intramedullary nail].","abstract":"To explore the clinical effects of proximal femur intramedullary nail (PFNA) in treating intertrochanteric fracture in elderly patients.From January,2008 to December,2010,the data of 86 elderly patients (aged, 80 to 93 years) with intertrochanteric fracture who underwent internal fixation were retrospectively analyzed. Of them, 54 patients (22 males and 32 females) were treated with close reduction and PFNA internal fixation(PFNA group),and 32 patients (12 males and 20 females) were treated with open reduction and nail-plate internal fixation (control group). Operation time, volume of blood loss, postoperative complications, time of hospitalization and bone union, hip function were compared between two groups.All patients were followed up more than 2 years. Operation time, volume of blood loss, postoperative complications,time of hospitalization in PFNA group were less than that of control group (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in time of bone union between two groups (P>0.05). According to Harris score to evaluate the function of hip joint, PFNA group was better than that of control group (P<0.01).Treatment of elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures with PFNA internal fixations can obtain satisfactory results, the method is better than that of traditional method.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490531","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.811109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.695781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.684596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.47988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.39827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.355867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.29873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.251596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.242293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.121984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Perfluorononanoic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorononanoic_acid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"Fixation (visual)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(visual)"},{"name":"Sparkling wine production","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_wine_production"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
