{"id":82202,"title":"pH and bacterial profile of dental plaque in children and adults of a low caries population.","abstract":"This study compares pH and microbiological profile of dental plaque in children and adults of a low caries population.Thirty-nine children, 12-14 years of age and 45 adults between 20 and 39 years of age in 5 Karen villages of the Tak province, Northern Thailand were examined for plaque, calculus, caries (DMFT) and pH measurements in resting plaque and after a sucrose rinse. Information on dietary and oral hygiene habits was obtained through interviews using a fixed questionnaire. Microbiological profile of plaque samples was analyzed with DNA-DNA checkerboard technique.Mean DMFT was 0.77 ± 1.56 and 87% of the adults and 67% of the children were caries free (p < 0.05). The mean resting pH was for both age groups in the range of 7.0-7.1 and significantly higher than a Swedish caries free reference group. Karen adult men had significantly lower pH minimum than females and children (p < 0.05). Supragingival plaque samples showed high levels of low acidogenic and anaerobic species, which dominated over strong acid producers such as streptococci.The study indicates that the Karen children and adults has a plaque physiology and microbiology predominating by low acidogenic anaerobes, which in addition to the low sucrose intake explains the low caries prevalence in this population.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685555","annotations":[{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.802167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.780214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.713864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.710022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.667691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.644958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.640967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.179125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Northern Hemisphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere"},{"name":"Water supply network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_network"},{"name":"Ethology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"}]}
