{"id":50360,"title":"Accessory lateral rectus in a patient with normal ocular motor control.","abstract":"Although supernumerary extraocular muscles are common in monkeys and other species, they are relatively rare in humans and typically are noted in the context of childhood strabismus. We present a case of an incidentally found unilateral accessory lateral rectus muscle in a 51-year-old woman with normal ocular motor control. In this patient, the accessory lateral rectus was approximately 10% the size of a normally sized lateral rectus muscle. It originated from the orbital apex, traveled between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus and attached to the superolateral aspect of the globe. This unique case demonstrates that accessory lateral rectus in humans may have no impact on eye movement and ocular alignment.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796602","annotations":[{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Optic nerve","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve"},{"name":"Extraocular muscles","weight":0.78517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Eye movement (sensory)","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_(sensory)"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.483031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.335087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lateral rectus muscle","weight":0.317819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Monkey","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Muscles of orbit","weight":0.0171701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscles_of_orbit"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Accessory nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_nerve"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Earth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"},{"name":"Motor control","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control"},{"name":"Supernumerary","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernumerary"}]}
