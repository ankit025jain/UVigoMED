{"id":69173,"title":"Right-siting chronic kidney disease care-a survey of general practitioners in Singapore.","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem in Singapore. Efforts are being made to right-site CKD care (stage 1 to 3) from specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs) to general practitioners (GPs) to ease congestion. This study aims to identify factors influencing screening and management of CKD among GPs in Singapore.A survey was conducted among the 1202 GPs between April and September 2010. The survey questionnaire was developed in collaboration with experts in nephrology and general practice, it included questions about screening, awareness and management of CKD.GPs registered with the National Healthcare Group General Practitioner (NHG GP) partner database.Three hundred and two GPs completed the survey. A total of 70% of the respondents were males and with their median years of practice as 18. A total of 86% of them reported screening for CKD while 50% of GPs were confident of managing patients with CKD stage 1; and 38% of GPs are aware of CKD guidelines. Majority of GPs (64%) agreed that right-siting of early CKD patients would ease congestion at SOCs. Some of the obstacles in CKD management listed by the GPs were lack of patient trust, experience and communication with the specialist and the inability of the patient to pay.GPs screen patients for CKD, however their awareness of guidelines is limited. Opportunities exist for improving physician recognition of CKD, awareness of CKD guidelines, improving collaborative care and reimbursement for the patient and the provider. This study has identified factors which when addressed could lead to wider acceptance of CKD right-siting by both the patients and the GPs.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463826","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.784086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.773912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.768737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.660967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.618953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.358761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.331498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.302028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Publicly funded health care","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Trust law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Traffic congestion","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion"}]}
