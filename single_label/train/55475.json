{"id":55475,"title":"Bilateral sclerosing orbital pseudotumour in an adult.","abstract":"Sclerosing pseudotumour of the orbit is a rare idiopathic chronic inflammatory process, which greatly mimics neoplasms both clinically and on imaging studies. It is therefore important to differentiate this entity from true neoplasms and to rule out any systemic associations. We present a rare case of sclerosing orbital pseudotumour in an adult man with no systemic illnesses who presented with painless progressive proptosis of both eyes and showed a gradual initial response to steroid therapy but relapsed after a 2-year interval.
