We report a duplication cyst at the floor of the mouth, lined by esophageal epithelium and treated successfully by surgical excision. To our knowledge, this is the third case of intraoral enteric duplication cysts lined with esophageal epithelium reported in the literature.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485518","annotations":[{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.654445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Enteric duplication cyst","weight":0.340182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_duplication_cyst"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.157444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
