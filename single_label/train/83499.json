{"id":83499,"title":"[Epidemiology investigation and biomechanics analyses for the correlation between sacroiliac joint disorder and lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration].","abstract":"To study the correlation between lumber disc degeneration and sacroiliac joint disorder, in order to provides a new understanding concepts and therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of chronic intractable low back pain.From August 2009 to October 2010,129 cases with lumbar disc herniation were studied with epidemiological methods. Among them, 61 patients with L4, disc herniation included 37 males and 24 females, ranging in aged from 20 to 75 years old, duration of the disease ranged from 1 to 144 months; The other 68 patients with L5S1 disc herniation included 32 males and 36 females,ranging in aged froml8 to 76 years old,duration of the disease ranged from 0.5 to 240 months. The clinical data, symptoms and signs,X-ray characteristics of lumbar spine and pelvis of the patients were investigated by epidemiological. The risk of lumbar disc herniation was calculated with case-control study; independent variables were screened with single factor analysis; the risk factors for lumbar disc herniation were determined with logistic regression analysis, and biomechanics analyses were taken.Among 129 patients with lumbar disc herniation, 88 cases associated with sacroiliac joint disorders, sacroiliac joint disorder was a risk factor of lumbar disc herniation (OR = 4.61, P = 0.00); 47 cases associated with sacroiliac joint disorders in 61 patients with L4,5 disc herniation, iliac crest uneven caused by iliac rotational displacement was a high risk factor of L4,5 disc herniation (OR = 11.27, P = 0.00); 41 cases associated with sacroiliac joint disorders in 68 patients with L5S1 disc herniation, lumbar sacral angle abnormalities caused by sacral tilt shift was a high risk factor L5S1 disc herniation (OR = 2.31, P = 0.03).Lumbar disc herniation and sacroiliac joint disorder are two of fallot, the two factors affect each other and there is a causal relationship. They are common exists in low back pain.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25338441","annotations":[{"name":"Low back pain","weight":0.835991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.745796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.662366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.64976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.481929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.383349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sacroiliac joint","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliac_joint"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.338228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Degenerative disc disease","weight":0.295147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disc_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.266938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.177919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.142819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.129477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Iliac crest","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliac_crest"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Epidemiological method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological_method"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Arthropathy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropathy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
