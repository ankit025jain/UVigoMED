{"id":78569,"title":"Study of the relationship between the degree of tinnitus annoyance and the presence of hyperacusis.","abstract":"Hyperacusis can be defined as a manifestation of an increased of central auditory pathways gain and can be considered a pre-tinnitus state. In some cases tinnitus can be caused by such increased gain.To evaluate the prevalence of hyperacusis in patients with tinnitus and its relation to the annoyance of tinnitus.Retrospective study with patients from the neurotology service complaining of tinnitus in the first consultation were submitted to clinical evaluation, a questionnaire and audiological evaluation of tinnitus and hyperacusis. The degree of annoyance of tinnitus and hyperacusis was measured using a visual analog scale.We analyzed medical records of 309 patients, 169 (54.7%) females and 140 (45.3%) males. The mean age was 53 years. The median degree of tinnitus annoyance was 7. Hyperacusis was present in 57 (18.4%) patients, with a median degree of 5. The degree of annoyance due to tinnitus patients with hyperacusis was similar to that of patients without hyperacusis.Hyperacusis was present in 18.4% of patients with tinnitus. The degree of annoyance due to tinnitus had no correlation with the presence of hyperacusis.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626888","annotations":[{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.8371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.516025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Hyperacusis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Neurotology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotology"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Analog signal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"States of Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Visual arts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts"},{"name":"Annoyance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annoyance"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"}]}
