{"id":33964,"title":"Application of two-dimensional echocardiography combined with enhanced flow in diagnosing fetal heart malformation.","abstract":"The current study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two-dimensional echocardiography combined with enhanced flow (e-flow) imaging for fetal heart malformation.A total of 1,639 pregnant women were enrolled. They were examined using fetal echocardiography combined e-flow. The obtained results were compared with those by postnatal examination or post-induction autopsy.Complete data were obtained from 1,286 out of the 1,639 fetuses (78.46%). Two-dimensional echocardiography combined with e-flow imaging had sensitivity, specificity, a misdiagnosis rate, and a missed diagnosis rate of 98.0%, 99.3%, 2.0%, and 0.7%, respectively. It has a consistency evaluation Kappa value of 0.970 (p = 0.000).Two-dimensional echocardiography combined with e-flow is an accurate and reliable diagnostic method for fetal heart malformation. It has high sensitivity and specificity.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779251","annotations":[{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.68333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.280357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.235405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"286","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/286"},{"name":"639","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/639"},{"name":"970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/970"},{"name":"Fetal circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_circulation"},{"name":"Chiropractic treatment techniques","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic_treatment_techniques"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"}]}
