{"id":88267,"title":"Spontaneous rupture of EPL and ECRB tendons in a washerwoman: an unusual phenomenon.","abstract":"Spontaneous rupture of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon is rare, and spontaneous non-traumatic rupture of both extensor pollicis longus (EPL) and extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) tendons is not reported in literature. Rupture of EPL is usually associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic or local steroid injections, fractures of the wrist and repetitive and excessive abnormal motion of the wrist joint. We describe a case of spontaneous rupture of the EPL and ECRB tendons in a female patient, washerwoman by occupation, with no predisposing factor. Exploration of the tendons along with end to end tendon repair was done with excellent results. We describe the possible mechanism of the injury and result after one year follow up.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875511","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.661552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.55789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle","weight":0.535849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_carpi_radialis_brevis_muscle"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.308715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Extensor pollicis longus muscle","weight":0.266968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_pollicis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_carpi_radialis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
