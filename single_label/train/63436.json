{"id":63436,"title":"Cixutumumab for patients with recurrent or refractory advanced thymic epithelial tumours: a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.","abstract":"No standard treatment exists for refractory or relapsed advanced thymic epithelial tumours. We investigated the efficacy of cixutumumab, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor in thymic epithelial tumours after failure of previous chemotherapy.49 patients were enrolled (37 with thymomas and 12 with thymic carcinomas) who received a median of eight cycles of cixutumumab (range 1-46). At the final actuarial analysis when follow-up data were updated (Nov 30, 2012), median potential follow-up (from on-study date to most current follow-up date) was 24·0 months (IQR 17·3-36·9). In the thymoma cohort, five (14%) of 37 patients (95% CI 5-29) achieved a partial response, 28 had stable disease, and four had progressive disease. In the thymic carcinoma cohort, none of 12 patients (95% CI 0-26) had a partial response, five had stable disease, and seven had progressive disease. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in both cohorts combined were hyperglycaemia (five [10%]), lipase elevation (three [6%]), and weight loss, tumour pain, and hyperuricaemia (two each [4%]). Nine (24%) of 37 patients with thymoma developed autoimmune conditions during treatment (five were new-onset disorders), the most common of which was pure red-cell aplasia. Two (4%) patients died; one was attributed to disease progression and the other to disease-related complications (respiratory failure, myositis, and an acute coronary event), which could have been precipitated by treatment with cixutumumab.Cixutumumab monotherapy is well-tolerated and active in relapsed thymoma. Development of autoimmunity during treatment needs further investigation.Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at the National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health), ImClone
