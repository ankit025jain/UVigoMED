{"id":74091,"title":"Application of computed tomography for differential diagnosis of glioma stoke and simple cerebral hemorrhage.","abstract":"To explore the value of computed tomography (CT) in the differential diagnosis of glioma stroke and simple cerebral hemorrhage.A total of 45 patients with glioma stroke and stroke as the initial symptom in our hospital from Jun., 2009 to Oct., 2013 were selected along with 50 individuals with simple cerebral hemorrhage in the same period randomly collected as a control group. The CT results in both groups were analyzed and compared.In the observation group, there were 25 patients with astrocytoma (55.6%), 11 with oligodendroglioma (24.4%), 8 with ependymoma (17.2%) and 1 with glioblastoma multiforma (GBM, 2.22%). Additionally, the major CT manifestation was coexistence of hemorrhage and tumor signs. By comparison, it could be found that the proportions of patients respectively with peripheral edema and space- occupying effect in the observation group were significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.01).Application of CT examination combined with medical history in patients has very important clinical value in the differential diagnosis of glioma stroke and simple cerebral hemorrhage.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24870733","annotations":[{"name":"Ependymoma","weight":0.932147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ependymoma"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Astrocytoma","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocytoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.751623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Oligodendroglioma","weight":0.74413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligodendroglioma"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.737514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.714726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.622993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Cerebral hemorrhage","weight":0.545374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.504448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Peripheral edema","weight":0.4624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_edema"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.411335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
