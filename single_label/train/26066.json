{"id":26066,"title":"A multicentric double blind randomised controlled trial of atenolol versus losartan as first line drug for mild to moderate essential hypertension.","abstract":"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a more reliable assessment of actual BP than office BP and is a more sensitive risk predictor of clinical cardiovascular outcomes. Recent international guidelines for hypertension have emphasised the usefulness of ambulatory BP for diagnosis and management of hypertension. We used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to monitor the effect of the pharmacological treatment in patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension. This was a multicentric randomised controlled trial having 360 subjects with 180 in each treatment arm. The duration of study was 6 months. The patients were randomly selected to receive atenolol or losartan as initial therapy. The dose of atenolol or losartan was 50 mg once daily at 8 am in the morning. Ambulatory BP assessment was done in a subgroup of subjects using Schiller BR-102 plus machine. One hundred and thirty patients were recruited for the study using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. There were 66 patients in atenolol arm and 64 patients in the losartan arm. A significant white coat hypertension was noticed in both the arms. Out of 130 subjects in the ambulatory group, 41.53% had a white coat hypertension. Statistically significant reduction of office BP was observed with both atenolol and losartan; however, no significant difference in efficacy of the two drugs was found in reducing office BP. However, when using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the reduction with either drug was not significant. The dipper status was better in the atenolol group than the losartan group. Neither of the drugs prevent morning surge of BP when administered once daily in the morning. There was high prevalence of white coat hypertension in patients with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension. There was similar reduction of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure by the 2 study drugs. Atenolol scores over losartan in converting non-dipper to dipper but its' impact on clinical outcome is not known. Morning surge of BP was unaffected by either of the study drugs.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154151","annotations":[{"name":"Atenolol","weight":0.870545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atenolol"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.841653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Essential hypertension","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_hypertension"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.659725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.504425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.397917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Ambulatory blood pressure","weight":0.335221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_blood_pressure"},{"name":"Losartan","weight":0.329701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losartan"},{"name":"White coat hypertension","weight":0.328656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_coat_hypertension"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.322685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Double blind","weight":0.319422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_blind"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.190881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.110565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"White coat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_coat"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
