{"id":43607,"title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor of colon: a case report and review of literature.","abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs originate from cells of Cajal and related stem cells. Surgery and imatinib therapy are the main lines of treatment.We report on a case with GIST in the colon treated with surgical resection followed by adjuvant imatinib therapy. This treatment showed no side-effects, and subsequent colonoscopy was unremarkable.The diagnosis was delayed for 12 months after initial presentation of vague abdominal pain, thus highlighting the need to improve clinical suspicion in order to detect GISTs in earlier stages when resection may be curative. Colonic GIST, in particular, may mimic presentation similar to ovarian cyst, as seen in the present case. This case report corroborates that patients with high-grade GISTs can be effectively treated with imatinib therapy. However, duration of treatment may vary depending on the grade of the tumor and side-effects.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778074","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Ovarian cyst","weight":0.844232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cyst"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor","weight":0.786361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.693363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.623055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.442846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.267779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Interstitial cell of Cajal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_cell_of_Cajal"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
