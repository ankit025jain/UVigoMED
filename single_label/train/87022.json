{"id":87022,"title":"[An ultrastructural study of the cervix epitelium infected with the human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 before and after treatment with contrasting thermo-laser therapy].","abstract":"The results of the ultrastructural study of the epithelium of the patient cervix infected by the human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 before and after treatment by contrasting thermo-laser therapy (CTLT) are presented. It was shown in this work that 1.5 and 6 months after treatment HPV DNA was not detected in the biopsy and the smear of the cervix using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the ultrathin sections, the structure of the epithelial cells from the biopsy after treatment corresponded to norm. There was effective elimination of HPV types 16 and 18 as Induces by CTLT method.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065147","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.2495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
