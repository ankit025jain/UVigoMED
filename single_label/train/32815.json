{"id":32815,"title":"[The utility of voxel-based morphometry in the diagnosis of spinocerebellar degeneration].","abstract":"We evaluated atrophic sites in the brainstem and cerebellum in the patients with spinocerebellar degeneration by using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Gray matter atrophy was found extensively in both the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis of subjects presenting the cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C; n=9). In addition, remarkable white matter atrophy was observed in the middle cerebellar peduncle, brainstem, and cerebellar hemispheres. In contrast, gray matter atrophy was not apparent in the cerebellar hemispheres or vermis of subjects in the SCA3 group (n=6), whereas intense white matter atrophy was visible in the middle cerebellar peduncle, brainstem, and cerebellar hemispheres. White matter atrophy was also observed in the brainstem and surrounding the dentate nucleus in both cases of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) (n=2), whereas gray matter atrophy of the cerebellum was not remarkable. In both the SCA6 group (n=3) and the SCA31 group (n=2), gray matter atrophy was prominent in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis; however, white matter atrophy was not found in the middle cerebellar peduncle and brainstem, whereas symmetric atrophy of white matter was found in the vicinity of the dentate nucleus. In each of these diseases, VBM findings were consistent with the pathological findings; therefore, VBM can be considered a useful tool for the diagnosis of spinocerebellar degeneration.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899352","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.883318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Grey matter","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_matter"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.797842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Dentate nucleus","weight":0.74466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_nucleus"},{"name":"Cerebellar vermis","weight":0.716692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_vermis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Multiple system atrophy","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_system_atrophy"},{"name":"Spinocerebellar ataxia","weight":0.357662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_ataxia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Spinocerebellar tract","weight":0.0634039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_tract"},{"name":"Voxel-based morphometry","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Peduncle (botany)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peduncle_(botany)"},{"name":"Middle cerebellar peduncle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebellar_peduncle"},{"name":"Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian_atrophy"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Grey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Sports_and_Aquatic_Centre"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
