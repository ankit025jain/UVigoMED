{"id":82709,"title":"[Sjögren's syndrome].","abstract":"Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the tear and salivary glands leading to dryness of the mouth and eyes. The awareness that extraglandular manifestations, such as polyneuropathy, arthritis or recurrent airway infections may indicate Sjögren's syndrome is important. In the diagnostic procedure, the tear and saliva production and antibodies against Sjögren's syndrome A (SS-A) and SS-B should be measured. A salivary gland biopsy should be performed when the diagnosis is not still clear. The therapy of oral and ocular dryness is mainly symptomatic whereas the treatment of extraglandular manifestations is based on experience with treatment of these manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
