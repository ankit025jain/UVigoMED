{"id":77901,"title":"Cochlear implantation in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorders.","abstract":"To present the outcomes of cochlear implantation (CI) in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorders (ANSD).The pre- and post-CI hearing outcomes in children with ANSD were retrospectively evaluated. Performance was assessed with categories of auditory performance (CAP) and the Manchester spoken language development scale (MSLDS).Full data were available in 27 implanted children with ANSD with average age at implantation 35.4 months (range 19-68 months). Nine children were implanted bilaterally, while 13 were bimodal. The pre-CI CAP and MSLDS scores were 2.5 (range 0-5) and 2.5 (range 0-6), while the post-CI scores 5.8 (range 2-9) and 7.7 (range 3-10), respectively.Although the outcome of CI in children with ANSD might vary, it is favourable in most of the cases. CI seems a justified hearing rehabilitation option for children with ANSD and limited benefits from conventional hearing aids.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24869444","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.37146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.152673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Spoken language","weight":0.129709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_language"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.108378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0324486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Manchester","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester"},{"name":"Auditory neuropathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_neuropathy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Language development","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_development"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"}]}
