{"id":82783,"title":"New bone formation enhanced by ADSCs overexpressing hRunx2 during mandibular distraction osteogenesis in osteoporotic rabbits.","abstract":"Promoting new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis (DO) in elderly patients with osteoporosis is still a challenge. In this study, we investigated the effect of gene therapy using local Runt-related gene 2 on new bone formation during osteoporotic mandibular DO in rabbits. First, we successfully established a mandibular osteoporotic animal model by ovariectomizing rabbits. Second, the right mandibles of the osteoporotic rabbits were distracted after corticotomy. The distraction gap of the rabbits in Group A2 and B2 were injected with Adv-hRunx2-GFP-transfected adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) and Adv-GFP-transfected ADSCs, respectively. Rabbits in Groups C2 (ovariectomized control) and D2 (sham surgery control) were injected with physiologic saline. New-generation bone tissue in the distraction gap was analyzed via plain radiographic examinations, micro-computed tomography, histological examinations, and biomechanical testing at weeks 3, 6, and 9 of the consolidation period. Results of above examinations showed that no ideal new bone formation was observed in Groups B2 and C2, but obvious ideal new bone formation was observed in Group A2 and D2. The results suggested that gene therapy using rhRunx2-modified ADSCs promoted new bone formation during osteoporotic mandibular DO and effectively compensated for the detrimental effects of systemic osteoporosis on new bone formation.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522890","annotations":[{"name":"Distraction osteogenesis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction_osteogenesis"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.848396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.765893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.599758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.567821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.420468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.308895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.265452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.208877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.108733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.0809308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Distraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"}]}
