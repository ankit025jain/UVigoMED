{"id":46640,"title":"The role of miR-18a in gastric cancer angiogenesis.","abstract":"To investigate the effect of miR-18a on angiogenesis in gastric cancer.We generated stable cell lines overexpressing miR-18a in SGC-7901 cells. Cell proliferation was assessed by the MTT assay. The effects of miR-18a overexpression on tumor growth and angiogenesis were assessed. Because of the key role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in gastric cancer progression, we also tested whether miR-18a overexpression affected the mTOR pathway.Ectopic expression of miR-18a significantly diminished cell proliferation in SGC-7901 cells (p<0.01). miR-18a overexpression significantly retarded SGC-7901 xenograft growth by 71.8% in vivo, and caused a marked reduction in tumor angiogenesis assessed by CD31-stained microvessel count. Western blot analysis of the xenografts showed that miR-18a overexpression substantially reduced the phosphorylation of two mTOR substrates, S6K1 and 4E-BPl, indicative of art inactivation of the mTOR pathway. Accompanying with the mTOR inactivation, the angiogenic factors, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor, were significantly downregulated.These data highlighted an important role for miR-18a in controlling gastric cancer growth and angiogenesis, therefore offering a possible therapeutic strategy against this malignancy.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624454","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.799178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.798823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.679258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.636749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.560642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.509714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.491925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.427833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Ectopic expression","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.179322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"CD31","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD31"},{"name":"P70-S6 Kinase 1","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P70-S6_Kinase_1"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
