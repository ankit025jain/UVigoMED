{"id":79144,"title":"MicroRNA?34a/c function as tumor suppressors in Hep?2 laryngeal carcinoma cells and may reduce GALNT7 expression.","abstract":"A family of small non-coding RNAs, ~22 nt in length, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), regulating ~30% of all human gene expression, have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of types of cancers, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In the current study, miR-34a and miR-34c were observed to be downregulated in human LSCC tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-34a and miR-34c in Hep-2 cells significantly induced the cell proliferation and migration ability in vitro. UDP-N-acetyl-?-D-galactosamine:polypeptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 7 (GALNT7), whose expression is negatively regulated by miR-34a and miR-34c in Hep-2 cells, is con?rmed to be a novel direct target gene of miR-34a and miR-34c. In conclusion, the current results suggest that miR-34a and miR-34c may function as tumor suppressors in LSCC through downregulation of GALNT7. The study of miR-34a, miR-34c and its novel target, GALNT7, may serve as novel potential makers for LSCC therapy.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482044","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Human genome","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.4243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Ectopic expression","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_expression"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
