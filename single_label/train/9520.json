{"id":9520,"title":"Simultaneous adrenal and cardiac g-protein-coupled receptor-g?? inhibition halts heart failure progression.","abstract":"The authors propose simultaneous inhibition of G?? signaling in the heart and the adrenal gland as a novel therapeutic approach for heart failure (HF).Elevated sympathetic nervous system activity is a salient characteristic of HF progression. It causes pathologic desensitization of ?-adrenergic receptors (?-AR), facilitated predominantly through G??-mediated signaling. The adrenal glands are key contributors to the chronically elevated plasma catecholamine levels observed in HF, where adrenal ?2-AR feedback inhibitory function is impaired also through G??-mediated signaling.We investigated the efficacy of a small molecule G?? inhibitor, gallein, in a clinically relevant, pressure-overload model of HF.Daily gallein treatment (10 mg/kg/day), initiated 4 weeks after transverse aortic constriction, improved survival and cardiac function and attenuated cardiac remodeling. Mechanistically, gallein restored ?-AR membrane density in cardiomyocytes, attenuated G??-mediated G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2-phosphoinositide 3-kinase ? membrane recruitment, and reduced Akt (protein kinase B) and glycogen synthase kinase 3? phosphorylation. Gallein also reduced circulating plasma catecholamine levels and catecholamine production in isolated mouse adrenal glands by restoring adrenal ?2-AR feedback inhibition. In human adrenal endocrine tumors (pheochromocytoma), gallein attenuated catecholamine secretion, as well as G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 expression and membrane translocation.These data suggest small molecule G?? inhibition as a systemic pharmacologic therapy for HF by simultaneously normalizing pathologic adrenergic/G?? signaling in both the heart and the adrenal gland. Our data also suggest important endocrine/cardiovascular interactions and a possible role for small molecule G?? inhibition in treating endocrine tumors such as pheochromocytoma, in addition to HF.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Animal
