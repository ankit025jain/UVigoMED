{"id":19403,"title":"[BCG vaccination: survey among children less than 5 years of age in an emergency department].","abstract":"France is a country with a low incidence of tuberculosis. However, there are important local variations: some parts of the city of Marseilles (southern France) presented a yearly incidence greater than 30/100,000 in 2010. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the BCG vaccine coverage among at-risk children younger than 5 years consulting in one of the city's pediatric emergency departments.This descriptive study took place in February 2013 and used a semi-directive questionnaire distributed to parents.One hundred and thirty-five children were included, 98 (72.6 %) were considered as being at risk of tuberculosis and among them 75 (76.5 %, 95 % CI [68.0-85.1]) were vaccinated with BCG. Parents' knowledge of tuberculosis was relevant in 48 % of the respondents. Only 19 % of the parents reported that BCG protects against tuberculosis, but 73 % were in favor of this vaccination. Two criteria significantly increased vaccine coverage among at-risk children: birth in Marseilles and age more than 6 months on the consultation day. The child living in a poor family and type of medical follow-up did not significantly influence BCG vaccine coverage.BCG coverage was high in at-risk children younger than 5 years born in Marseilles. Cooperation between private physicians, maternity hospitals and mothers, and children's public health services probably facilitates this high level of protection.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721417","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.811578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.795066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.786258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"France","weight":0.650484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.30764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"City","weight":0.22245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.178566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Publicly funded health care","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Marseille","weight":0.0239124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Southern France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_France"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"}]}
