{"id":77505,"title":"Gender differences in work-related asthma: surveillance data from California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey, 1993-2008.","abstract":"To characterize work-related asthma by gender.We analyzed state-based sentinel surveillance data on confirmed work-related asthma cases collected from California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey during 1993-2008. We used Chi-square and Fisher's Exact Test statistics to compare select characteristics between females and males.Of the 8239 confirmed work-related asthma cases, 60% were female. When compared to males with work-related asthma, females with work-related asthma were more likely to be identified through workers' compensation (14.8% versus 10.6%) and less likely to be identified through hospital data (14.2% versus 16.9%). Moreover, when compared to males, females were more likely to have work-aggravated asthma (24.4% versus 13.5%) and less likely to have new-onset asthma (48.0% versus 56.5%). Females were also more likely than males with work-related asthma to work in healthcare and social assistance (28.7% versus 5.2%), educational services (11.8% versus 4.2%), and retail trade (5.0% versus 3.9%) industries and in office and administrative support (20.0% versus 4.0%), healthcare practitioners and technical (13.4% versus 1.6%), and education training and library (6.2% versus 1.3%) occupations. Agent groups most frequently associated with work-related asthma were miscellaneous chemicals (20.3%), cleaning materials (15.3%), and indoor air pollutants (14.9%) in females and miscellaneous chemicals (15.7%), mineral and inorganic dusts (13.2%), and pyrolysis products (12.7%) in males.Among adults with work-related asthma, males and females differ in terms of workplace exposures, occupations, and industries. Physicians should consider these gender differences when diagnosing and treating asthma in working adults.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673105","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Welfare","weight":0.765893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"New Jersey","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"},{"name":"California","weight":0.58524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.58524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Workers' compensation","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.553624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.505164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Retail","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.463777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.454017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.441807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.421461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.391439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.352396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.34992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.273265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.246245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Pyrolysis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Trade","weight":0.173734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Adult education","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_education"},{"name":"Inorganic compound","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Jersey","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Indoor air quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_air_quality"},{"name":"Gender role","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
