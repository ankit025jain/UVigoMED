{"id":66423,"title":"Heat shock and other apoptosis-related proteins as therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.","abstract":"Defects within apoptotic pathways have been implicated in prostate cancer (PCa) tumorigenesis, metastatic progression and treatment resistance. A hallmark of cancers is the ability to derail apoptosis by inhibiting the apoptotic signal, reducing the expression of apoptotic proteins and/or amplifying survival signals through increased production of antiapoptotic molecule. This review describes associations between heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the human androgen receptor (AR), the role of HSPs and other stress-induced proteins in PCa development and emerging strategies in targeting these protective proteins to treat PCa.
