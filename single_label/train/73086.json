{"id":73086,"title":"[Preliminary clinical evaluations of bevacizumab for recurrent malignant glioma in Chinese patients].","abstract":"To explore the clinical efficacies of bevacizumab (BEV) for high-grade glioma (HGG) in Chinese patients and evaluate its profiles of adverse events and usage safety.A total of 15 HGG cases, including glioblastoma multiform (GBM) (n = 12) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) (n = 3), were selected to receive the treatments of BEV (10 mg/kg, q2w) and temozolomide (TMZ, 150 mg/m(2), 5 d/28 d). Their radiological responses, clinical status, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Also their adverse events and severity were recorded and analyzed.According to the RANO criteria, during the short period (<3 months), 11 cases had significant radiological and clinical responses. However, only 4 cases responded during a follow-up period of beyond 3 months. Three cases had retrogression after BEV chemotherapy. At 6 months post-treatment, 8 cases (53.3%) survived without lesion progression and the median PFS was 8 ± 5 months. During a longer follow-up (>6 months), 8 patients had tumor retrogression, including 5 deaths. The median overall survival period was 24 ± 10 months. The adverse events included hypertension (n = 2), wound-healing complication (n = 1), vomiting (n = 2) and cerebro-spinal fluid leakage (n = 1). All complications were cured by activate supportive measures.After BEV treatment, most patients obtain more significant short-term responses with good toleration. For re-operative cases, the usage of BEV should be deferred to one month post-operation so as to avoid the occurrence of wound-healing complications.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924716","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Temozolomide","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temozolomide"},{"name":"Astrocytoma","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocytoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.819321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Anaplasia","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasia"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.714106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.675665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.568795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.389409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"China","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"}]}
