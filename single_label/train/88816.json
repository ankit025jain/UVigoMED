{"id":88816,"title":"Combined acetabulum and pelvic ring injuries.","abstract":"Combined fractures of the acetabulum and pelvic ring are more common than previously believed, with an incidence as high as 15.7%. Recent series that include combined injuries indicate that the incidence of lateral compression and anteroposterior compression pelvic ring injuries is similar and that transverse and both-column acetabular fractures are the most common acetabular fracture patterns. Combined injuries most often are the result of high-energy mechanisms, and, compared with patients who present with isolated pelvic or acetabular injury, patients with combined injury typically have higher injury severity scores, higher transfusion requirements, and lower systolic blood pressure, with reported mortality rates of 1.5% to 13%. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. The first priority is resuscitation following the Advanced Trauma Life Support protocols. Once the patient is stable, acetabular fractures and pelvic ring injuries should be assessed individually, and the most appropriate treatment for each should be outlined. These treatments should then be integrated to develop the most appropriate overall treatment strategy. Although outcomes data are available for isolated acetabulum and pelvic ring disruptions, no such data currently exist for combined injuries.
