{"id":17417,"title":"Resolution of a fungal mycotic aneurysm after a contaminated steroid injection: a case report.","abstract":"In the past ten years there have been three separate outbreaks of fungal contaminated steroid injections from compounding pharmacies. The 2012 outbreak of central nervous system fungal infections associated with contaminated methylprednisolone produced by a United States compounding pharmacy has led to 750 infections (151 with meningitis and paraspinal infections and 325 cases with paraspinal infections without meningitis) and 64 deaths as of October 23, 2013. Exserohilum rostratum has been the predominant pathogen identified by culture, polymerase chain reaction or antibody tests. According to previous reports, cerebral involvement with phaeohyphomycosis has a high risk of morbidity and mortality.We report a 41 year-old Caucasian woman who received a lumbar methylprednisolone injection from a contaminated lot in August 2012. She was diagnosed with fungal meningitis by cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and positive (1, 3) beta-D-glucan after cultures and polymerase chain reaction were negative. Two weeks after onset of therapy, she developed a 4.1 mm superior cerebellar artery mycotic aneurysm associated with new stroke symptoms, which resolved with thirty-two weeks of antifungal treatment.This is the rare case report of successful medical management of a cerebral mycotic aneurysm with stroke symptoms related to a presumed phaeohyphomycosis in an immunocompetent individual. Further studies are needed to determine the utility of cerebrospinal fluid (1, 3) beta-D-glucan in diagnosing and monitoring patients with meningitis thought to be related to fungal infection.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885172","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.780078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.696601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.660616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.589704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.517123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.462384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.443838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.239044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.136029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
