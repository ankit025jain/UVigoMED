{"id":22800,"title":"Endotracheal tube biofilm and ventilator-associated pneumonia with mechanical ventilation.","abstract":"To analyze biofilm on internal and external surfaces of endotracheal tubes after their use in critical care patients, and to produce evidence of association between use of the tube, presence of biofilm, and the occurrence of pneumonia.This was a clinical study performed at the Intensive Care Unit of an emergency hospital in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil. Data collection involved 30 endotracheal tubes used on adult patients for a period of ?48 h of mechanical ventilation for scanning electron microscopy.Analysis of the biofilm on the 30 tubes by scanning electron microscopy showed various abiotic and biotic structures, predominantly on the internal surface, such as: fibrin network, erythrocytes, leukocytes, cocci, bacilli, and molds, among others. The intubation period of the endotracheal tube for ?8 days represented one of the risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 7.41, P?<?0.001).The presence of the endotracheal tube permits microbial colonization, overall contributing to the development of biofilm and the occurrence of pneumonia.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519948","annotations":[{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.796792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.786808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.780386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.760059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Coccus","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccus"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.619871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.595828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Mold","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.445673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.377087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Abiotic component","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiotic_component"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.316462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Biotic component","weight":0.0582433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotic_component"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Hypha","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
