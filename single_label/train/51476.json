{"id":51476,"title":"Expression of a novel recombinant fusion protein BVN-T?4 and its effects on diabetic wound healing.","abstract":"A recombinant fusion protein BVN-T?4 is successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, purified in the laboratory and applied onto the wounds of diabetic mice to investigate its effects on diabetic wound healing. Our results show that the recombinant protein BVN-T?4 can promote diabetic wound healing in the murine model.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686156","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.542728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.439695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.433819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"}]}
