{"id":11603,"title":"Neuroprotective effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ in a model of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron degeneration that ultimately results in progressive paralysis and death. Growing evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. To further explore the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction and nitroxidative stress contribute to disease pathogenesis at the in vivo level, we assessed whether the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant [10-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-methyl-3,6-dioxo-1,4-cyclohexadien-1-yl)decyl]triphenylphosphonium methane sulfonate (MitoQ) can modify disease progression in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS. To do this, we administered MitoQ (500 ÂµM) in the drinking water of SOD1(G93A) mice from a time when early symptoms of neurodegeneration become evident at 90 days of age until death. This regime is a clinically plausible scenario and could be more easily translated to patients as this corresponds to initiating treatment of patients after they are first diagnosed with ALS. MitoQ was detected in all tested tissues by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry after 20 days of administration. MitoQ treatment slowed the decline of mitochondrial function, in both the spinal cord and the quadriceps muscle, as measured by high-resolution respirometry. Importantly, nitroxidative markers and pathological signs in the spinal cord of MitoQ-treated animals were markedly reduced and neuromuscular junctions were recovered associated with a significant increase in hindlimb strength. Finally, MitoQ treatment significantly prolonged the life span of SOD1(G93A) mice. Our results support a role for mitochondrial nitroxidative damage and dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants may be of pharmacological use for ALS treatment.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582549","annotations":[{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral
