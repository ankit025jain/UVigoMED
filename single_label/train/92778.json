{"id":92778,"title":"Role of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Mcl-1 in apoptosis induction by withaferin A in human breast cancer cells.","abstract":"Withaferin A (WA), a bioactive constituent of Ayurvedic medicine plant Withania somnifera, is a potent apoptosis inducer in cancer cells but the mechanism of cell death induction is not fully characterized. The present study was undertaken to determine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), including c-jun NH2 -terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 MAPK, and anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in regulation of WA-induced apoptosis using human breast cancer cells. Exposure of MCF-7 (estrogen responsive) and SUM159 (triple negative) human breast cancer cells to WA resulted in increased phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, but these effects were relatively more pronounced in the former cell line than in SUM159. Overexpression of manganese-superoxide dismutase conferred partial protection against WA-mediated hyperphosphorylation of ERK, but not JNK or p38 MAPK. Cell death resulting from WA treatment in MCF-7 cells was significantly augmented by pharmacological inhibition of ERK and p38 MAPK. Interestingly, the WA-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was partially but significantly blocked in the presence of a JNK-specific inhibitor. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK or JNK had no effect on WA-induced apoptosis in SUM159 cells. The WA-treated cells exhibited induction of long and short forms of Mcl-1. RNA interference of Mcl-1 alone triggered apoptosis. Furthermore, the WA-induced cell death in MCF-7 cells was modestly but significantly augmented by knockdown of the Mcl-1 protein. These observations indicate that: MAPK have cell line-specific role in cell death by WA, and Mcl-1 induction confers modest protection against WA-induced apoptosis.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24019090","annotations":[{"name":"RNA
