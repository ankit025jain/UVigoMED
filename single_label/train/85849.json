{"id":85849,"title":"Identification of stem-like cells in non-small cell lung cancer cells with specific peptides.","abstract":"Recent studies indicate that tumor maintenance, metastasis and drug-resistance are mainly conducted by a small subset of cancer cells which are termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs). Successful identification of CSCs/CSLCs might lead to discovery of the novel and effective therapeutic targets for cancers. In our study, lung CSCs/CSLCs were enriched by sphere-forming assay. Screening and selection of specific binding peptides for lung CSCs/CSLCs were performed with bacterial surface display method. Selected peptide named HCBP-1 exhibited highest specific binding capability as examined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Drug-resistant lung CSCs/CSLCs might be characterized with HCBP-1 peptide and several microRNAs related to the stem-like properties were discriminatively expressed in HCBP-1+ subpopulation. Moreover, at least two distinct subpopulations in H460 tumor sphere cells could be distinguished by HCBP-1 peptide. Thus, a new method was established to identify lung CSCs/CSLCs, which provided robust approaches for the research of CSCs/CSLCs.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846302","annotations":[{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.719035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.539374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.513748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.242525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.10613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0229109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"}]}
