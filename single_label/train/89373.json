{"id":89373,"title":"The incidence of proximal humeral fractures in New York State from 1990 through 2010 with an emphasis on operative management in patients aged 65 years or older.","abstract":"Proximal humeral fractures are commonly encountered injuries. The development of locking plate technology and reverse shoulder arthroplasty may have changed the treatment patterns of these fractures.We used the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database in New York State to determine the incidence of proximal humeral fractures from 1990 through 2010 and the choice of treatment: closed reduction-internal fixation, open reduction-internal fixation (ORIF), hemiarthroplasty (HA), or total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).The population-adjusted incidence per 100,000 increased from 15.35 in 1990 to 19.4 in 2010 (P < .0001). In patients aged 65 years or older, the incidence increased from 78.9 in 1990 to 101.0 in 2010 (P < .0001). In 1990, 20.4% of proximal humeral fractures were treated operatively; in 2010, this increased to 28.6% (P < .0001). Closed reduction-internal fixation/ORIF accounted for 58.4% of operative cases in 1990, decreasing to 46.6% in 2001 and increasing to 59.4% in 2010. HA was used in 27.1% of operative cases in 1990, increasing to 41% in 2001 and decreasing to 29.4% in 2010. TSA was used in 6.4% of operative cases in 1990, decreasing to 1.5% in 2001 with an increase to 7.5% in 2010.The incidence of proximal humeral fractures in patients aged 65 or older increased by 28% between 1990 and 2010, and operative management increased by more than 40%. The use of ORIF increased between 2001 and 2010, corresponding with the use of locking plate technology. There was an associated decrease in HA. TSA increased between 2006 and 2010, corresponding to the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725897","annotations":[{"name":"New York","weight":0.121805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Hemiarthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiarthroplasty"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"York","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"}]}
