{"id":46633,"title":"[Pathomorphism of rectal cancer during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy].","abstract":"The pathomorphism of rectal cancer (RC) was studied in 99 patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy using two drugs (5-fluorouracil and xeloda). A morphological study indicated the qualitatively similar manifestations of pathomorphism (tumor necrosis, inflammation, and sclerosis) which were more pronounced in the use of xeloda. Three degrees of the pathomorphism of RC have been identified: the tumor was unchanged, changed, and undetectable.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624841","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.69924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.57403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.565631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.138184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.0953293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Catholic Church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"}]}
