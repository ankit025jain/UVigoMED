{"id":86942,"title":"Shingles vaccination: background and advice for community nurses.","abstract":"Shingles (or zoster) is a reactivation of an existing varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. During the initial infection, VZV causes a systemic disease known as varicella or chickenpox, and this initial infection normally occurs early in childhood in the absence of routine vaccination. Although varicella is normally a mild disease, shingles is associated with significant morbidity and some mortality, particularly in older people. The most significant severe consequence is post-herpetic neuralgia. There is an effective vaccine available for this, known as Zostavax, which is a live-attenuated VZV vaccine. Guidelines in the UK recommend that this is offered to everyone when they become 70 years of age, plus those aged 79 years as part of a catch-up campaign, with those between these ages not being eligible. It is important for all health-care professionals, including district and community nurses, to proactively promote this vaccine, so that those eligible can make an informed decision about whether to receive it.
