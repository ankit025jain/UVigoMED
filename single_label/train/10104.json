{"id":10104,"title":"Engineering of a novel anti-CD40L domain antibody for treatment of autoimmune diseases.","abstract":"CD40-CD40L interactions play a critical role in regulating immune responses. Blockade of CD40L by Abs, such as the anti-CD40L Ab 5c8, demonstrated positive clinical effects in patients with autoimmune diseases; however, incidents of thromboembolism (TE) precluded further development of these molecules. In this study, we examined the role of the Fc domain interaction with Fc?Rs in modulating platelet activation and potential for TE. Our results show that the interaction of the 5c8 wild-type IgG1 Fc domain with Fc?Rs is responsible for platelet activation, as measured by induction of PAC-1 and CD62P. A version of 5c8 with a mutated IgG1 tail was identified that showed minimal Fc?R binding and platelet activation while maintaining full binding to CD40L. To address whether Fc effector function is required for immunosuppression, a potent Ab fragment, termed a \"domain Ab\" (dAb), against murine CD40L was identified and fused to a murine IgG1 Fc domain containing a D265A mutation that lacks Fc effector function. In vitro, this dAb-Fc demonstrated comparable potency to the benchmark mAb MR-1 in inhibiting B cell and dendritic cell activation. Furthermore, the anti-CD40L dAb-Fc exhibited a notable efficacy comparable to MR-1 in various preclinical models, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin-induced Ab responses, alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation, \"heart-to-ear\" transplantation, and NZB Ã— NZW F1 spontaneous lupus. Thus, our data show that immunosuppression and TE can be uncoupled and that a CD40L dAb with an inert Fc tail is expected to be efficacious for treating autoimmune diseases, with reduced risk for TE.
