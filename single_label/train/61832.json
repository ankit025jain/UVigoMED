{"id":61832,"title":"Intensified chemo-immunotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.","abstract":"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) receiving conventional treatment have a poor clinical outcome. We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in young (?60 years old, Clin A study) and elderly (>60 and < or =75 years old, Clin B study) patients with newly diagnosed PTCL. Clin A patients (n=61) received two courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone)-21 with alemtuzumab (AL, 30?mg) followed by two courses of high-dose chemotherapy. On the basis of donor availability, patients in response received allogeneic (allo) or autologous (auto) stem cell transplantation (SCT). Clin B patients (n=25) received six courses of CHOP-21 and AL (10?mg). Clin A responding patients were 38 of 61 (62%) and received alloSCT (n=23) or autoSCT (n=14); one complete remission (CR) patient was not transplanted. At a median follow-up of 40 months, the 4-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 49, 44 and 65%, respectively. In Clin B study, the response rate was 72%. At a median follow-up of 48 months, the 4-year OS, PFS and DFS rates were 31, 26 and 44%, respectively. In conclusion, front-line alloSCT or autoSCT is effective in prolonging DFS in young patients; AL in elderly improved response with no survival benefit.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662801","annotations":[{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Alemtuzumab","weight":0.861668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alemtuzumab"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.706565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.700939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.68146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
