{"id":51896,"title":"Effects of sitagliptin on glycemia, incretin hormones, and antropyloroduodenal motility in response to intraduodenal glucose infusion in healthy lean and obese humans and patients with type 2 diabetes treated with or without metformin.","abstract":"The impact of variations in gastric emptying, which influence the magnitude of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion, on glucose lowering by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors is unclear. We evaluated responses to intraduodenal glucose infusion (60 g over 120 min [i.e., 2 kcal/min], a rate that predominantly stimulates GIP but not GLP-1) after sitagliptin versus control in 12 healthy lean, 12 obese, and 12 type 2 diabetic subjects taking metformin 850 mg b.i.d. versus placebo. As expected, sitagliptin augmented plasma-intact GIP substantially and intact GLP-1 modestly. Sitagliptin attenuated glycemic excursions in healthy lean and obese but not type 2 diabetic subjects, without affecting glucagon or energy intake. In contrast, metformin reduced fasting and glucose-stimulated glycemia, suppressed energy intake, and augmented total and intact GLP-1, total GIP, and glucagon in type 2 diabetic subjects, with no additional glucose lowering when combined with sitagliptin. These observations indicate that in type 2 diabetes, 1) the capacity of endogenous GIP to lower blood glucose is impaired; 2) the effect of DPP-4 inhibition on glycemia is likely to depend on adequate endogenous GLP-1 release, requiring gastric emptying >2 kcal/min; and 3) the action of metformin to lower blood glucose is not predominantly by way of the incretin axis.
