{"id":89156,"title":"Hand and wrist complaints in pregnancy.","abstract":"Hand and wrist complaints can decrease the quality of life of pregnant women, which can occur or aggravate during pregnancy and advance to chronic state if left untreated. The purpose of this study was to describe hand and wrist complaints in relation to pregnancy and assess their significance in pregnancy.In a prospective cross-sectional study, 383 participants were randomly selected from among pregnant women on or over 28 weeks of gestation, attending the primary care maternal health clinic in a university hospital. The prevalence and severity of hand and wrist complaints were assessed using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ). The symptomatic pregnant women were consulted by an orthopedist. The specific diagnoses of the patients were made based on patient history and physical examination.According to BCTQ scoring 258 (67.4 %) pregnant women were symptomatic. The diagnoses were as follows: asymptomatic 125 (32.6 %), nonspecific symptoms 138 (36 %), tendinitis 80 (20.9 %), carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) 39 (10.2 %) and cubital syndrome 1 (0.3 %). There was no association noted between the diagnoses and numbers of pregnancies, occupational status, age, gestational weeks, weight gain or body mass index (BMI) (p > 0.05).The prevalence of hand and wrist complaints is high in pregnant women. All pregnant women should be investigated for hand and wrist complaints in routine antenatal checks to ensure good life quality during pregnancy and for avoiding these complaints advancing to chronic state. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of musculoskeletal systems disorders in pregnancy.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Wounds and
