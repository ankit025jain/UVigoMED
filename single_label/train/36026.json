{"id":36026,"title":"Isolated frontosphenoidal synostosis: a rare cause of synostotic frontal plagiocephaly.","abstract":"Unilateral fusion of the frontoparietal suture is the most common cause of synostotic frontal plagiocephaly. Localized fusion of the frontosphenoidal suture is rare but can lead to a similar, but subtly distinct, phenotype.A retrospective chart review of the authors' craniofacial database was performed. Patients with isolated frontosphenoidal synostosis on CT imaging were included. Demographic data, as well as the clinical and radiographic findings, were recorded.Three patients were identified. All patients were female and none had an identifiable syndrome. Head circumference was normal in each patient. The mean age at presentation was 4.8 months (range 2.0-9.8 months); 2 fusions were on the right side. Frontal flattening and recession of the supraorbital rim on the fused side were consistent physical findings. No patient had appreciable facial angulation or orbital dystopia, and 2 patients had anterior displacement of the ipsilateral ear. All 3 patients were initially misdiagnosed with unilateral coronal synostosis, and CT imaging at a mean age of 5.4 months (range 2.1-10.8 months) was required to secure the correct diagnosis. Computed tomography findings included patency of the frontoparietal suture, minor to no anterior cranial base angulation, and vertical flattening of the orbit without sphenoid wing elevation on the fused side. One patient underwent CT scanning at 2.1 months of age, which demonstrated a narrow, but patent, frontosphenoidal suture. The patient's condition was assumed to be a deformational process, and she underwent 6 months of unsuccessful helmet therapy. A repeat CT scan obtained at 10.7 months of age demonstrated the synostosis. All 3 patients underwent fronto-orbital correction at mean age of 12.1 months (range 7.8-16.1 months). The mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 11.7 months (range 1.9-23.9 months).Isolated frontosphenoidal synostosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical frontal plagiocephaly.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606403","annotations":[{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.873318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.755043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.732061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.588441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.423444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.256199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.216971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.127314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.121605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.11872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Ipsilateral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsilateral"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Wing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Frontal sinus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_sinus"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"}]}
