{"id":23668,"title":"A concept for routine emergency-care data-based syndromic surveillance in Europe.","abstract":"We developed a syndromic surveillance (SyS) concept using emergency dispatch, ambulance and emergency-department data from different European countries. Based on an inventory of sub-national emergency data availability in 12 countries, we propose framework definitions for specific syndromes and a SyS system design. We tested the concept by retrospectively applying cumulative sum and spatio-temporal cluster analyses for the detection of local gastrointestinal outbreaks in four countries and comparing the results with notifiable disease reporting. Routine emergency data was available daily and electronically in 11 regions, following a common structure. We identified two gastrointestinal outbreaks in two countries; one was confirmed as a norovirus outbreak. We detected 1/147 notified outbreaks. Emergency-care data-based SyS can supplement local surveillance with near real-time information on gastrointestinal patients, especially in special circumstances, e.g. foreign tourists. It most likely cannot detect the majority of local gastrointestinal outbreaks with few, mild or dispersed cases.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476632","annotations":[{"name":"Europe","weight":0.495963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.344594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.222846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ambulance","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Spacetime","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Emergency telephone number","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number"},{"name":"Norovirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"},{"name":"Notifiable disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notifiable_disease"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Administrative division","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_division"},{"name":"Systems engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering"},{"name":"1147","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1147"},{"name":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Dispatch (logistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatch_(logistics)"},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Computer cluster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster"},{"name":"Clinical surveillance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_surveillance"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Biological dispersal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_dispersal"}]}
