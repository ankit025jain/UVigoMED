Significant morbidity can result from hand infections when they are not appropriately diagnosed or treated. Clinical recognition, proper initial evaluation, and treatment are key to prevent functional deficit or devastated morbidity when confronted with hand infections.

A case report is presented of a patient with worsening pain of a digit after a penetrating injury. The diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical findings and plain radiography.
