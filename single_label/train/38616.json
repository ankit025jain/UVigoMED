{"id":38616,"title":"The cystic fibrosis V232D mutation inhibits CFTR maturation by disrupting a hydrophobic pocket rather than formation of aberrant interhelical hydrogen bonds.","abstract":"Processing mutations that inhibit folding and trafficking of CFTR are the main cause of cystic fibrosis. Repair of CFTR mutants requires an understanding of the mechanisms of misfolding caused by processing mutations. Previous studies on helix-loop-helix fragments of the V232D processing mutation suggested that its mechanism was to lock transmembrane (TM) segments 3 and 4 together by a non-native hydrogen bond (Asp232(TM4)/Gln207(TM3)). Here, we performed mutational analysis to test for Asp232/Gln207 interactions in full-length CFTR. The rationale was that a V232N mutation should mimic V232D and a V232D/Q207A mutant should mature if the processing defect was caused by hydrogen bonds. We report that only Val232 mutations to charged amino acids severely blocked CFTR maturation. The V232N mutation did not mimic V232D as V232N showed 40% maturation compared to 2% for V232D. Mutation of Val232 to large nonpolar residues (Leu, Phe) had little effect. The Q207L mutation did not rescue V232D because Q207L showed about 50% maturation in the presence of corrector VX-809 while V232D/Q207A could no longer be rescued. These results suggest that V232D inhibits maturation by disrupting a hydrophobic pocket between TM segments rather than forming a non-native hydrogen bond. Disulfide cross-linking analysis of cysteines W356C(TM6) and W1145C(TM12) suggest that the V232D mutation inhibits maturation by trapping CFTR as a partially folded intermediate. Since correctors can efficiently rescue V232D CFTR, the results suggest that hydrophilic processing mutations facing a hydrophobic pocket are good candidates for rescue with pharmacological chaperones.
