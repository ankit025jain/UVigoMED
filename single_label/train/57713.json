{"id":57713,"title":"[Effects of 8-OH-DPAT and m-CPP on depression-like behavior in prenatally stressed ovariectomized rats treated with low dose of 17beta-estradiol].","abstract":"The present work was aimed at a comparative estimation of the effect of stimulation of 5-HTIA and 5-HT(2B/2C) receptors on depression-like behavior in adult ovariectomized (estrogen-deficient) female offspring from prenatally stressed (PS) mothers. PS ovariectomized female rats were treated for 14 days of with the vehicle, a low dose of 17beta-estradiol (5.0 microg/rat, s.c.), 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg), 5-HT(2B2C) receptor agonist m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT plus 17beta-estradiol, or m-CPP plus 17beta-estradiol. Then, the behavior of PS ovariectomized female rats was studied in the forced swimming (Porsolt) test and the open-field test. It was established that 8-OH-DPAT administered alone or in a combination with a low dose of 17beta-estradiol produced an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test as compared to the untreated control PS ovariectomized offspring. Application of these drugs in PS ovariectomized offspring led to decreased frequency of rearing, exploratory behavior, and grooming in the open field test. The m-CPP treatment also resulted in an antidepressant-like effect in PS ovariectomized offspring in the forced swimming test. However, co-administration of m-CPP with a low dose of 17beta-estradiol to PS ovariectomized offspring increased the level of depression, thus producing pro-depressant effect in the forced swimming test.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076753","annotations":[{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.748291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.458563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"5-HT1 receptor","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1_receptor"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Business-to-consumer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-consumer"},{"name":"Behavioural despair test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_despair_test"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Human swimming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Cucking stool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucking_stool"},{"name":"Live fire exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_fire_exercise"},{"name":"5-HT2B receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2B_receptor"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Open field system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_field_system"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Personal grooming","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_grooming"},{"name":"Gender of rearing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_of_rearing"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
