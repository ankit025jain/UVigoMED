{"id":73137,"title":"[Strategy and management in brain metastasis].","abstract":"The brain metastases management has evolved over the last fifteen years and may use varying strategies including more or less aggressive treatments, sometimes combined, leading to an improvement in patients' survival and quality of life. The therapeutic decision is subject to a multidisciplinary, taking into account established prognostic factors including patient's general condition, extra-cerebral disease status and clinical and radiological presentation of brain metastases. In this article, we propose a management strategy based on the state of current knowledge and available therapeutic resources.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923061","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.637578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.598635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.217819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
