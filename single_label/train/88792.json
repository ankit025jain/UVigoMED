{"id":88792,"title":"Resilience and quality of life among Wenchuan earthquake survivors: the mediating role of social support.","abstract":"To examine the extent social support mediates resilience and quality of life in Wenchuan earthquake survivors.Originals.Self-report psychological questionnaires, the standard Chinese 12-item Short Form (SF-12v2), the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used to interview a total of 2080 survivors from 19 counties in the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake area. A regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the mediating effect of social support on quality of life.Males and individuals with a higher level of education were found to have a better quality of life. The association between resilience and quality of life improved after social support was included, suggesting that at least a part of this association was mediated by the level of social support provided.This analysis highlighted that the level of resilience and quality of life after an earthquake was associated with the level of social support. This result has clear policy implications, and indicates that more focus needs to be placed on policies that aim for the provision of early mental health intervention and social support to improve the quality of life of earthquake survivors.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792190","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.660458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.511436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"China","weight":0.496625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.356056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.289852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.274709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.191112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"2008 Sichuan earthquake","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake"},{"name":"SQL Server Reporting Services","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Reporting_Services"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"2080s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2080s"},{"name":"Written vernacular Chinese","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_vernacular_Chinese"},{"name":"Counties of Norway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Norway"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Multi-valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-valve"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Structuralism","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Normative economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_economics"},{"name":"Psychological resilience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"},{"name":"Originals","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originals"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Wenchuan County","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchuan_County"}]}
