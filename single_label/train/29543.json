{"id":29543,"title":"Marked variability in peri-partum anesthetic management of patients on buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT): can there be an underlying acute opioid induced hyperalgesia precipitated by neuraxial opioids in BMT patients?","abstract":"To compare adequacy of peri-partum pain management with or without neuraxial opioids in patients on buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT).After institutional review board approval for the study protocol, retrospective peripartum anesthesia/analgesia data of BMT patients for five-year period were accessed and analyzed.Out of reviewed 51 patient charts, nineteen patients were found eligible for final comparative analysis. The daily amounts of peri-partum rescue analgesics with vs without neuraxial opioids were equianalgesic doses of parenteral hydromorphone (10.7 +/- 13.8 mg vs 2.6 +/- 0.7 mg, P = 0.45 for vaginal delivery; 16.4 +/- 21.1 mg vs 5.3 +/- 3.6 mg, P = 0.42 for elective cesarean section (CS)), oral ibuprofen (1.1 +/- 0.5g vs 0.8 +/- 0.4g, P = 0.37 for vaginal delivery; 1.1 +/- 0.2g vs 1.6 +/- 0.6g, P = 0.29 for elective CS), and acetaminophen (0.2 +/- 0.4g vs 0 +/- 0g, P = 0.56 for vaginal delivery; 0.3 +/- 0.3g vs 0.2 +/- 0.2g, P = 0.81 for elective CS). In the patients who underwent emergent CS after failed labor (all had received epidural opioids), there was clinical trend for higher daily amounts ofperi-partum rescue analgesics (parenteral hydromorphone 35.6 +/- 37.5 mg; oral ibuprofen 1.2 +/- 0.4g; oral acetaminophen 1.2 +/- 0.5g), when compared with vaginal delivery patients or elective CS patients who all had received neuraxial opioids.As the study was underpowered (n = 19), future adequately powered studies are required to conclude for-or-against the use ofneuraxial opioids in BMT patients; and pro-nociceptive activation by neuraxial opioids may be worth investigating to improve our understanding of peripartum pain management of BMT patients.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649783","annotations":[{"name":"Buprenorphine","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine"},{"name":"Hydromorphone","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydromorphone"},{"name":"Ibuprofen","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.761972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.69786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.482972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.468455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.31318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.22073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.140403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Arousal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"}]}
