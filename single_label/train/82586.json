{"id":82586,"title":"Clinical investigation of patient related factors in non carious cervical lesions.","abstract":"The majority of the studies on non carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) dealt with characteristics of NCCLs without identifying patient related factors associated with them.The basis of this study to identify these factors and to see if there are any association with the findings.This study was conducted among 34 patients referred to the conservative clinic of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-araba, Lagos. Questions regarding patient's complaints, dietary habits and toothcleaning techniques were asked and correlated with the occurrence and severity of NCCLs clinically.Over a third, (41.2%) of the subjects presented with dentine sensitivity resulting in pain. Fifty percent (50%) of the patients were on one form of medication or the other. Out of this number, 50% habitually chewed vitamin C tablets. With respect to diet, 61.8%, 58.8% and 47.1% of the patients were on diet rich in fruits, soft drinks and fruit juices respectively. The degree of severity(extensiveness) of lesions significantly increases with age of patient (p = 0.001). Tooth cleaning habits played an important role in the occurrence, distribution and pattern of NCCLs. There was association between the tooth cleaning technique used and the extensiveness and distribution of the lesions. The horizontal technique accounted for 54.7% of lower jaw lesions while 63.7% and 55.8% of lesions found in the vertical and mixed (circular) techniques respectively were found in the upperjaw.Awareness of the multifactorial etiology in noncarious cervical lesions may help the clinician to formulate an appropriate treatment plan and preventive strategies in the management of NCCLs.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579510","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.570278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.418046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.378259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Juice","weight":0.290125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.223408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.222201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.189897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Soft drink","weight":0.143552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0902121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0283361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
