{"id":64067,"title":"Photoallergy.","abstract":"Abstract Photoallergic contact dermatitis (PACD) is a hypersensitivity reaction mounting from skin exposure to generally harmless amounts of ultraviolet and/or visible light in the presence of a photoreactive allergen. These reactions are typically delayed type (Gell and Coombs type IV) reactions and require pre-sensitization to photoallergens. Phototoxic reactions are clinically similar and often difficult to differentiate from photoallergies, but they are caused by interaction of light with photoirritants and do not require sensitization. The main investigative technique to diagnose PACD is photopatch testing, which is not commonly used; therefore, PACD may be overlooked in many patients. Currently, leading contact photosensitizers are sunscreens and topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This article provides an overview on photocontact allergies.
