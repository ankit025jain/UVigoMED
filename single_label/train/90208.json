{"id":90208,"title":"[Limited open reduction and double plates internal fixation for treatment of Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic femoral fracture after hip arthroplasty].","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of limited open reduction and double plates internal fixation in the treatment of Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic femoral fracture after hip arthroplasty.A retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 12 patients with Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic femoral fracture after hip arthroplasty between May 2007 and October 2012, who underwent limited open reduction and double plates internal fixation. Of 12 patients, 4 were male and 8 were female, aged 76-85 years (mean, 81.6 years); the left side was involved in 5 patients and the right side in 7 patients. The cement prosthesis was used in 3 cases and cementless prosthesis in 9 cases; double acting head of hip arthroplasty was performed in 4 cases and total hip arthroplasty in 8 cases. The median time from first hip arthroplasty to re-fracture was 13 months (range, 5 months-5 years). The causes of injury were traffic accident in 2 cases and falling in 10 cases. Combined fractures included contralateral tibial and fibular fractures and ipsilateral distal humeral fracture (1 case), ipsilateral proximal humeral fracture (2 cases), ipsilateral distal radial fracture (1 case), and rib fracture (1 case). The time from injury to operation was 5.6 days on average (range, 3-10 days).The incisions all healed by first intention, and no infection or deep venous thrombosis of lower extremity occurred. Twelve cases were followed up 6-24 months (mean, 13.3 months). One female patient died of acute myocardial infarction at 16 months after operation. All the fractures were healed, with X-ray healing time of 12.5 weeks on average (range, 10-16 weeks). The time of full weight bearing was 13 weeks on average (range, 10-18 weeks). Ten cases could walk freely after operation, and 2 cases could walk by the aid of walking aid appliance. At last follow-up, the Harris score of hip function was 87.3 on average (range, 75-93).The method of limited open reduction and double plates internal fixation for Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic femoral fracture after hip arthroplasty is effective in maintaining stability, protecting blood supply, promoting fracture healing, and doing functional exercise early. The long-term effectiveness needs further observation.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and
