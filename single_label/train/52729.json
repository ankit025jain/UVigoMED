{"id":52729,"title":"Glycation of apolipoprotein C1 impairs its CETP inhibitory property: pathophysiological relevance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Apolipoprotein (apo)C1 is a potent physiological inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). ApoC1 operates through its ability to modify the electrostatic charge at the lipoprotein surface. We aimed to determine whether the inhibitory ability of apoC1 is still effective in vivo in patients with diabetes and whether in vitro glycation of apoC1 influences its electrostatic charge and its CETP inhibitory effect. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS ApoC1 concentrations and CETP activity were measured in 70 type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients, 113 patients with type 2 diabetes, and 83 control subjects. The consequences of in vitro glycation by methylglyoxal on the electrostatic properties of apoC1 and on its inhibitory effect on CETP activity were studied. An isoelectric analysis of apoC1 was performed in patients with T1D and in normolipidemic-normoglycemic subjects. RESULTS An independent negative correlation was found between CETP activity and apoC1 in control subjects but not in patients with diabetes. HbA1c was independently associated with CETP activity in T1D patients. In vitro glycation of apoC1 modified its electrostatic charge and abrogated its ability to inhibit CETP activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The isoelectric point of apoC1 in T1D patients was significantly lower than that in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS The ability of apoC1 to inhibit CETP activity is impaired in patients with diabetes. Glycation of apoC1 leads to a change in its electrostatic properties that might account, at least in part, for a loss of constitutive CETP inhibition and an increase in plasma CETP activity in patients with diabetes.
