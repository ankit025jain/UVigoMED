{"id":77578,"title":"[Current situation and future issues of work-related diseases in Japan].","abstract":"According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, more than 1,000 workers are killed by occupational accidents and diseases every year, in Japan. The number of workers, who took more than 3 days of sick leave with work-related diseases, reaches 7,000-8,000 every year. Prevention of work-related diseases is essential to maintain and promote workers' health and to ensure quality of their working life. It is required that not only occupational health care staff but also clinicians pay more attention to the detection and prevention of work-related diseases.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605517","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.601449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Welfare","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare"},{"name":"Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)","weight":0.473233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare_(Japan)"},{"name":"Department of Health (United Kingdom)","weight":0.403393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.227918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Sick leave","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave"},{"name":"Labour Party (UK)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Work accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_accident"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"}]}
