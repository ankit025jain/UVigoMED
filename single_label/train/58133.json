{"id":58133,"title":"Postpartum posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in a twin pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia-eclampsia: case report.","abstract":"This is the second case in literature of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in a twin pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia-eclampsia. A 27-year-old primigravida with dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy was admitted at 36 weeks of gestation for induction of labour due to preeclampsia. On the second day postpartum, the patient developed severe hypertension, visual symptoms, confusion, headache, and eclamptic fits. Head computed tomography (CT) showed hypodense basal ganglia lesions. The patient was treated in the intensive treatment unit with hydralazine and labetalol infusions and anticonvulsants. Five days later, there was complete clinical improvement and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal. The patient was discharged 11 days post-delivery. Diagnosis of PRES is based on the presence of clinical features of acute neurologic compromise, abnormal neuroimaging findings, and complete reversibility of findings after prompt treatment. Early recognition and proper treatment result in complete reversibility of this condition.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992794","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Basal ganglia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.638467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.636534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.631377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.619792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Labetalol","weight":0.587336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labetalol"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.559725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.491559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Hydralazine","weight":0.441686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydralazine"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.343863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_reversible_encephalopathy_syndrome"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
