{"id":567,"title":"Factors influencing non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment in Jepara, central Java, Indonesia.","abstract":"One of the most serious problems for tuberculosis (TB) control is non-adherence to TB treatment. We studied the factors influencing non-adherence to TB treatment in Indonesia to inform TB treatment adherence strategies. We con- ducted semi-structured interviews with non-adherent patients and key informants in Jepara, Central Java, Indonesia. Three major themes were found in reasons for non-adherence to TB treatment: 1) knowledge about TB, 2) knowledge about TB treatment and 3) choosing and changing a health care treatment facility. Respondents had an inadequate knowledge about TB and its treatment. Feeling healthy and having financial problems were the most common reasons for TB treatment non-adherence. Respondents sought treatment from many different health care providers, and often changed the treatment facility location. TB treatment adherence might improve by providing better education about the disease and its treatment to those undergoing treatment. Providing information about where to receive treatment and that treatment is free could also improve compliance.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427354","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.524224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Indonesia","weight":0.513317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.424062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.178566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Java","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0727777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Jepara","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jepara"},{"name":"Facility location","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_location"},{"name":"Central Java","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Java"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"}]}
