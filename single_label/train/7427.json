{"id":7427,"title":"Lead optimization of 1,4-azaindoles as antimycobacterial agents.","abstract":"In a previous report, we described the discovery of 1,4-azaindoles, a chemical series with excellent in vitro and in vivo antimycobacterial potency through noncovalent inhibition of decaprenylphosphoryl-?-d-ribose-2'-epimerase (DprE1). Nevertheless, high mouse metabolic turnover and phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) off-target activity limited its advancement. Herein, we report lead optimization of this series, culminating in potent, metabolically stable compounds that have a robust pharmacokinetic profile without any PDE6 liability. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficacy for 1,4-azaindoles in a rat chronic TB infection model. We believe that compounds from the 1,4-azaindole series are suitable for in vivo combination and safety studies.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874895","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.682687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.627961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.579542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.396679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Phosphodiesterase","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiesterase"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.28582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Noncovalent bonding","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncovalent_bonding"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Group (periodic table)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(periodic_table)"},{"name":"Epimerase and racemase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimerase_and_racemase"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Antimycobacterial","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimycobacterial"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Legal liability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability"}]}
