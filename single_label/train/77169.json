{"id":77169,"title":"Influence of night-time protein and carbohydrate intake on appetite and cardiometabolic risk in sedentary overweight and obese women.","abstract":"The present study investigated whether whey (WH) protein, casein (CAS) protein or a carbohydrate placebo (PLA) consumed 30 min before sleep could acutely alter appetite or cardiometabolic risk the following morning. A total of forty-four sedentary overweight and obese women (BMI: 25·7-54·6 kg/m2) completed this stratified, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (WH: n 16, age 27·4 (sd 5·0) years; CAS: n 15, age 30·3 (sd 8·1) years; PLA: n 13, age 28·5 (sd 7·2) years). The participants came to the laboratory at baseline (visit 1) and again in the morning after night-time ingestion of either protein or PLA (visit 2). Visit 2 was conducted at least 48 h after visit 1. During visits 1 and 2, the following parameters were measured: appetite (hunger, satiety and desire to eat); resting metabolism; blood lipid and glucose levels; the levels of insulin, leptin, C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor-1, cortisol and adiponectin. Data were analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA. No group × time interactions were observed for the measured variables; however, a main effect of time was observed for increased satiety (P= 0·03), reduced desire to eat (P= 0·006), and increased insulin levels (P= 0·004) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance values (P= 0·01) after the consumption of either protein or PLA. The results of the present study reveal that night-time consumption of protein or carbohydrate by sedentary overweight and obese women improves their appetite measures but negatively affects insulin levels. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the effects of chronic consumption of low-energy snacks at night on body composition and cardiometabolic risk.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833598","annotations":[{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.891139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.872516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.851187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Casein","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Hunger (motivational state)","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_(motivational_state)"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.550591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Hunger","weight":0.537454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Whey","weight":0.309824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey"},{"name":"Snack food","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack_food"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.164349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.118632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.069656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
