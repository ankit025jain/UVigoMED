{"id":89513,"title":"[Desire for amputation in body integrity identity disorder].","abstract":"Body integrity identity disorder (BIID) is a rare neuropsychiatric disorder in which patients experience a mismatch between the real and experienced body from childhood. BIID results in a strong desire to amputate or paralyse one or more limbs.We describe two BIID patients. A 40-year-old healthy male suffered daily from his desire for amputation, and therefore made a request for amputation at our academic medical centre. A 61-year-old male proceeded to self-amputation to create the body he had wished for, thereby curing himself from BIID.To date, no treatment has been found for BIID. Therefore patients often proceed to self-amputation, which could lead to serious and even dangerous complications. These case histories suggest that elective amputation may be a treatment for BIID. Many doctors, however, will question the admissibility of amputation of a healthy limb.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713336","annotations":[{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.876779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.74506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.558538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.48582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"History","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Body integrity identity disorder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_identity_disorder"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Admissible evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_evidence"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Cultural identity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_identity"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 40","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_40"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 61","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_61"}]}
