{"id":46842,"title":"Matched within-patient cohort study of transient arterial phase respiratory motion-related artifact in MR imaging of the liver: gadoxetate disodium versus gadobenate dimeglumine.","abstract":"To compare frequency and severity of arterial phase respiratory motion-related artifact following gadoxetate disodium and gadobenate dimeglumine in matched patients administered both contrast media at different times.Institutional review board approval was obtained, with patient consent waived, for this retrospective, HIPAA-compliant study. Ninety patients underwent gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) followed by gadoxetate disodium-enhanced abdominal MR and were matched to 90 patients who were administered the same contrast media in reverse order (180 patients). Matching was based on length of time between paired examinations. Gadobenate dimeglumine dose was weight based (0.1 mmol per kilogram body weight). Gadoxetate disodium dose was typically fixed (10 or 20 mL [off label]). Three readers blinded to contrast agent assigned a respiratory motion-related artifact score (1 [none] to 5 [nondiagnostic]) for nonenhanced, arterial, venous, and late dynamic phases. Frequency of greater new arterial phase respiratory motion-related artifact in each within-patient pair and aggregate rate of new severe transient arterial phase respiratory motion-related artifact (scores ? 2, nonenhanced and venous and/or late dynamic phases; ? 4, arterial phase) were compared (McNemar test).For groups 1 and 2, respectively, mean dose (gadoxetate disodium, 16.6 mL vs 16.6 mL, P = .99; gadobenate dimeglumine, 18.0 mL vs 17.8 mL, P = .77) and mean time between examinations (191 days vs 191 days, P = .99) were not significantly different between matched populations. Gadoxetate disodium was associated with significantly higher incidence of new arterial phase respiratory motion-related artifact compared with gadobenate dimeglumine (39% vs 10%, P < .0001) and of new severe transient arterial phase respiratory motion-related artifact (18% vs 2%, P < .0001) in patients administered both agents at different times.Fixed off-label dose (10 or 20 mL) of gadoxetate disodium is associated with arterial phase respiratory motion-related artifact that is sometimes severe and occurs significantly more often than after gadobenate dimeglumine in patients who received both contrast media.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Digestive System
