{"id":69147,"title":"Study of 320-slice dynamic volume CT perfusion in different pathologic types of kidney tumor: preliminary results.","abstract":"To investigate microcirculatory differences between pathologic types of kidney tumor using 320-slice dynamic volume CT perfusion.Perfusion imaging with 320-slice dynamic volume CT was prospectively performed in 85 patients with pathologically proven clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n?=?66), papillary RCC (n?=?7), chromophobe RCC (n?=?5), angiomyolipoma (AML) with minimal fat (n?=?7), or RCC (n?=?78). Equivalent blood volume (Equiv BV), permeability surface-area product (PS; clearance/unit volume?=?permeability), and blood flow (BF) of tumor and normal renal cortex were measured and analyzed. Effective radiation dose was calculated.There was a significant difference in all three parameters between tumor and normal renal cortex (P<0.001). Equiv BV was significantly different between RCC and AML with minimal fat (P?=?0.038) and between clear cell RCC and AML with minimal fat (P<0.001). Mean Equiv BV and BF were significantly higher in clear cell RCC than in papillary RCC (P<0.001 for both) and mean Equiv BV was higher in clear cell RCC than in chromophobe RCC (P<0.001). The effective radiation dose of the CT perfusion protocol was 18.5 mSv.Perfusion imaging using 320-slice dynamic volume CT can be used to evaluate hemodynamic features of the whole kidney and kidney tumors, which may be useful in the differential diagnosis of these four pathologic types of kidney tumor.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465588","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.871956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sievert","weight":0.79307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.424285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.417087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.359626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.275104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Renal cortex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cortex"},{"name":"Angiomyolipoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiomyolipoma"},{"name":"Chromophobe cell","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophobe_cell"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Besloten Vennootschap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besloten_Vennootschap"},{"name":"Vascular permeability","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_permeability"}]}
