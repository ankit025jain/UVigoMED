{"id":43089,"title":"Prognostic marker microRNA-125b inhibits tumorigenic properties of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via suppressing tumorigenic molecule eIF5A2.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to a group of small non-coding RNA with differential expression in tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).This study investigates the involvement of miR-125b in HCC.Clinical analysis of miR-125b was performed using data derived from miRNA profiling and qPCR. Phenotypic changes of liver cell lines were examined after ectopic miR-125b expression. Lastly, bioinformatics analysis coupled with luciferase reporter assay was used to reveal the cellular target of miR-125b.A down-regulation of miR-125b was found in HCC tumors and cultured cells. Patients having tumors with ?twofold reduction in miR-125b compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues contributed to 23 out of 49 HCC cases (46.9Â %), while this down-regulation was usually found in patients with tumor venous infiltration and recurrence. miR-125b expression was also negatively correlated with increased serum AFP level and poor overall survival of patients. Ectopic expression of miR-125b led to alleviated tumor phenotypes of HCC cells. Among the 110 bioinformatically predicated candidates, 31 of them negatively correlated with miR-125b in HCC tumors for which one of them named eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (eIF5A2), known also as a liver oncofetal molecule, was validated to be a direct target of miR-125b in HCC.This study has evidenced for the negative correlation of tumor miR-125b expression with poor prognosis of HCC patients. Expression of miR-125b can reverse the tumorigenic properties of cultured HCC cells via suppressing the tumorigenic molecule eIF5A2, thus postulating restoration of miR-125b level as a way to counteract liver tumorigenesis.","date":"2014-09-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811246","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.862322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Eukaryote","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.743227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.723534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.692801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.654355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Eukaryotic initiation factor","weight":0.568028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_initiation_factor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Ectopic expression","weight":0.274778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.268363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.234657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.0861693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
