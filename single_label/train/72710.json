{"id":72710,"title":"An experimental study for syndiotactic polyvinyl alcohol spheres as an embolic agent: can it maintain spherical shape in vivo?","abstract":"Syndiotactic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) had been developed to overcome the drawbacks of atactic PVA spheres that deform easily, which can lead to non-target embolization. This study was performed to evaluate the in vivo stability of spherical shape of the syndiotactic PVA spheres. Selective arteriography and transarterial embolization (TAE) were performed in the main renal arteries of eight New Zealand white rabbits using syndiotactic PVA sphere that consisted of syndiotactic PVA skin and a copolymer core of vinyl acetate/vinyl pivalate. The size of the syndiotactic PVA spheres used for the TAE was 212-355 ?m. The rabbits were sacrificed 12-14 days after TAE. Gross and microscopic examinations of each kidney were performed. The microscopic examination showed infarction of all embolized kidneys. Syndiotactic PVA spheres were seen uniformly within the arterial lumen and appeared as round ring-like structures without any deformity. The syndiotactic PVA spheres exclusively occupied the arterial lumen. As a conclusion, syndiotactic PVA spheres maintained their spherical shape without significant deformation in this in vivo short-term experimental study. Further investigation is necessary for evaluation of detailed effects of physical stability in tumor embolization.
