{"id":62897,"title":"[Case of lymphomatoid gastropathy detected during follow-up after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer].","abstract":"A man in his 70s underwent chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus in 2009. A follow-up gastroendoscopy performed 3 years later revealed a reddish depressed lesion in the greater curvature of the middle stomach body. On the basis of histological and immunohistochemical findings and clinical features, including endoscopic findings, a diagnosis of lymphomatoid gastropathy was made. Follow-up studies revealed a decrease in the size of the lesion and the development of chronic gastritis. Although lymphomatoid gastropathy is rare, recognition of this disease is important because misdiagnosis as lymphoma may lead to unnecessary radical therapeutic procedures.
