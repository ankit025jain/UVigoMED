{"id":12911,"title":"Comparison of primer sets and one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kits for the detection of bluetongue viral RNA.","abstract":"Bluetongue virus is the etiological agent of bluetongue, one of the most important insect-transmitted animal diseases in the world. To establish a feasible diagnostic procedure for detecting the viral RNA, seven commercially available one-step RT-PCR kits in combination with three primer sets were evaluated. Results of this study showed remarkable differences in analytical sensitivity between the examined RT-PCR kits. In addition, it was found that a World Organization for Animal Health-recommended primer set may not be effective in detecting most BTV RNA.
