{"id":67674,"title":"LINE-1 methylation in leukocyte DNA, interaction with phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase variants and bladder cancer risk.","abstract":"Aberrant global DNA methylation is shown to increase cancer risk. LINE-1 has been proven a measure of global DNA methylation. The objectives of this study were to assess the association between LINE-1 methylation level and bladder cancer risk and to evaluate effect modification by environmental and genetic factors.Bisulphite-treated leukocyte DNA from 952 cases and 892 hospital controls was used to measure LINE-1 methylation level at four CpG sites by pyrosequencing. Logistic regression model was fitted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Interactions between LINE-1 methylation levels and environmental and genetic factors were assessed.The risk of bladder cancer followed a nonlinear association with LINE-1 methylation. Compared with subjects in the middle tertile, the adjusted OR for subjects in the lower and the higher tertiles were 1.26 (95% CI 0.99-1.60, P=0.06) and 1.33 (95% CI 1.05-1.69, P=0.02), respectively. This association significantly increased among individuals homozygous for the major allele of five single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene (corrected P-interaction<0.05).The findings from this large-scale study suggest that both low and high levels of global DNA methylation are associated with the risk of bladder cancer.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595004","annotations":[{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.804336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.735604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.579637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.514737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.307319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Phospholipid","weight":0.285129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.239737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.165553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Retrotransposon","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"952","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/952"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Quantile","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"The Strip (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strip_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Aberrant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberrant"},{"name":"Interactions (The Spectacular Spider-Man)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactions_(The_Spectacular_Spider-Man)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"}]}
