{"id":56751,"title":"Ranibizumab for age-related macular degeneration: a meta-analysis of dose effects and comparison with no anti-VEGF treatment and bevacizumab.","abstract":"Ranibizumab is used monthly or as-needed (PRN) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. However, which treatment regimen is more effective remains unknown. The objectives of this study are to: (i) compare the efficacy of monthly versus as-needed quarterly treatment; and (ii) compare the efficacy of ranibizumab 0·5 mg treatment with: (a) no anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); (b) ranibizumab 0·3 mg; and (c) bevacizumab.This is a systematic meta-analytic review of randomized-controlled clinical trials of ranibizumab in neovascular AMD. Weighted multiple regression analyses were used to compare the monthly vs. PRN/quarterly treatment.Eight randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Patients on the monthly ranibizumab treatment had higher visual acuity letter gains (? = 0·441, P < 0·05) compared with patients on as-needed/quarterly treatment. More patients on the monthly treatment gained ?15 letters than as-needed/quarterly treatment (? = 0·582, P < 0·05). Ranibizumab produced significantly higher improvement in visual acuity (d = 1·20, z = 7·14, P < 0·05) and led to a higher proportion of patients gaining ?15 letters (OR: 6·67; 95% CI 3·16-14·06; P < 0·05) when compared with non-anti-VEGF. Ranibizumab did not show any advantage in visual acuity compared with bevacizumab. No significant differences were found between ranibizumab 0·3 mg and 0·5 mg.This is the first meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the efficacy of different treatment regimens for anti-VEGF therapy. Ranibizumab 0·3 or 0·5 mg monthly treatment was more effective for neovascular AMD than non-anti-VEGF treatments but is no better than bevacizumab.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635444","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.862755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.720349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.64757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.528107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.496777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.248181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0201095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Magazine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine"},{"name":"Z","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
