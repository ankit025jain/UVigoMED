{"id":40367,"title":"Risk factors of symptomatic NSAID-induced small intestinal injury and diaphragm disease.","abstract":"The aetiology for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced small intestinal injuries has not been well characterised.To determine the risk factors of symptomatic NSAID-induced small intestinal injuries, including diaphragm disease.Of the 1262 symptomatic patients who underwent videocapsule endoscopy and/or double-balloon enteroscopy, 156 consecutive patients were verified as having taken NSAIDs. Their CYP2C9*2, *3 and *13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined by allelic discrimination with Taqman 5'-nuclease assays.Of the 156 NSAIDs users, 31 patients (20%) were diagnosed with NSAID-induced small intestinal injury. Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of comorbidities and the use of oxicams (meloxicam, ampiroxicam and lornoxicam) or diclofenac were associated with an increased risk of NSAID-induced small intestinal injury (adjusted OR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.05-8.41, P = 0.041 and adjusted OR: 7.05, 95% CI: 2.04-24.40, P = 0.002, respectively). The combination of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAID was more damaging than aspirin alone. Age, sex, concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors, indications for NSAIDs use, duration of NSAIDs use and CYP2C9*2, *3 and *13SNPs were unrelated. The use of meloxicam and CYP2C9*3SNPs were significantly associated with an increased risk for diaphragm disease (adjusted OR: 183.75, 95% CI: 21.34-1582.38; P < 0.0001 and adjusted OR: 12.94, 95% CI: 1.55-108.36, P = 0.018, respectively).The use of specific NSAIDs and the factors interfering with NSAIDs metabolism might associate with small intestinal injury, especially with diaphragm disease.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041257","annotations":[{"name":"Diclofenac","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.872679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.837399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.829254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.805308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.77955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.663118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Meloxicam","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloxicam"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.524104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nuclease","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclease"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.265369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.135759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
