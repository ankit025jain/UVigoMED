{"id":77541,"title":"Serum CA125 and NSE: biomarkers of disease severity in patients with silicosis.","abstract":"We investigated the clinical significance of tumor markers in patients with silicosis.Eighty silicosis patients without malignancy and 50 healthy volunteers were compared for serum tumor marker concentrations. Pulmonary function and several routine laboratory tests were performed. Correlation between serum tumor marker concentrations and severity markers for silicosis was analyzed. Tumor marker concentrations were detected in both blood and BALF samples in silicosis patients. The pre- and post-lavage differences in the serum tumor marker concentrations were also investigated. Immunohistochemical staining for tumor markers was performed in a lung biopsy specimen from a silicosis patient.Both serum NSE and CA125 concentrations were significantly higher in cases compared with controls. Significant positive correlations were found between values of NSE and CA125 and LDH concentration. Significant negative correlations were also observed between values of NSE and CA125 and spirometric parameters. Patients with silicosis had higher concentrations of NSE in BALF than that in serum. 11 of 14 patients experienced a decrease in NSE concentrations following whole lung lavage. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive NSE staining in lung biopsy specimen.Serum NSE and CA125 concentrations would provide valuable clinical information to assess disease severity in silicosis.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642341","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.748529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.547743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.513583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.463093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.303381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.301834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.288801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Silicosis","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.115315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
