{"id":60762,"title":"H2AX phosphorylation regulated by p38 is involved in Bim expression and apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells induced by imatinib.","abstract":"Increasing evidence suggests that histone H2AX plays a critical role in regulation of tumor cell apoptosis and acts as a novel human tumor suppressor protein. However, the action of H2AX in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells is unknown. The detailed mechanism and epigenetic regulation by H2AX remain elusive in cancer cells. Here, we report that H2AX was involved in apoptosis of CML cells. Overexpression of H2AX increased apoptotic sensitivity of CML cells (K562) induced by imatinib. However, overexpression of Ser139-mutated H2AX (blocking phosphorylation) decreased sensitivity of K562 cells to apoptosis. Similarly, knockdown of H2AX made K562 cells resistant to apoptotic induction. These results revealed that the function of H2AX involved in apoptosis is strictly related to its phosphorylation (Ser139). Our data further indicated that imatinib may stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family member p38, and H2AX phosphorylation followed a similar time course, suggesting a parallel response. H2AX phosphorylation can be blocked by p38 siRNA or its inhibitor. These data demonstrated that H2AX phosphorylation was regulated by p38 MAPK pathway in K562 cells. However, the p38 MAPK downstream, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 and -2, which phosphorylated histone H3, were not required for H2AX phosphorylation during apoptosis. Finally, we provided epigenetic evidence that H2AX phosphorylation regulated apoptosis-related gene Bim expression. Blocking of H2AX phosphorylation inhibited Bim gene expression. Taken together, these data demonstrated that H2AX phosphorylation regulated by p38 is involved in Bim expression and apoptosis in CML cells induced by imatinib.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830786","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Mitogen","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.673121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.669892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.662863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"MAPK/ERK pathway","weight":0.637836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"H2AFX","weight":0.51292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2AFX"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.502214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.465934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.375994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"BCL2L11","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCL2L11"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
