{"id":62835,"title":"[Blueberry Muffin Baby and Langerhans' congenital cell histiocytosis].","abstract":"Blueberry Muffin Baby is a rare neonatal cutaneous syndrome for purpuric lesions reflective of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Many causes are known, examples are congenital infections, malignancy and hematologic disorders. Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is a clonal proliferation of dendritic histiocytes. This has very rarely been associated with a Blueberry Muffin Baby presentation.We report the case of a newborn presenting with Blueberry Muffin Baby syndrome related to congenital Langherans' cell histiocytosis. At birth, he had multiple purpuric lesions on the trunk, limbs and face. Skin biopsy showed a dermal proliferation of histiocytes staining positive for S100 and CD1a. Chest and bone radiographs, and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Skin lesions have resolved in 8 weeks, the patient is in complete remission at 18 months of follow-up.A Blueberry Muffin Baby syndrome may reveal neonatal Langerhans' histiocytosis.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507207","annotations":[{"name":"Langerhans cell","weight":0.892581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis","weight":0.603049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell_histiocytosis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.601573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.500223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.499795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.447037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.368039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Histiocyte","weight":0.332347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocyte"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"CD1","weight":0.213202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD1"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.194532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.149696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.136778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.11369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Histiocytosis","weight":0.108851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocytosis"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"Hematologic disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematologic_disease"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"}]}
