{"id":10311,"title":"Genetic characterization of a novel duck-origin picornavirus with six 2A proteins.","abstract":"A novel virus was detected from diseased ducks and completely determined. The virus was shown to have a picornavirus-like genome layout. Interestingly, the genome contained a total of up to six 2As, including four 2As (2A1-2A4) each having an NPGP motif, an AIG1-like 2A5, and a parechovirus-like 2A6. The 5'UTR was predicted to possess a hepacivirus/pestivirus-like internal ribosome entry site (IRES). However, the subdomain IIIe consisted of a 3 nt stem and five unpaired bases, distinct from those found in all other HP-like IRESs. The virus was most closely related to duck hepatitis A virus, with amino acid identities of 37.7?%, 39?% and 43.7?% in the P1, P2 and P3 regions, respectively. Based on these investigations, together with phylogenetic analyses, the virus could be considered as the founding member of a novel picornavirus genus that we tentatively named 'Aalivirus', with 'Aalivirus A' as the type species.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659102","annotations":[{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.887295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.785924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Picornavirus","weight":0.731221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picornavirus"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.700897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Internal ribosome entry site","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_ribosome_entry_site"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.586963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.461506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Duck","weight":0.39495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"A5 road (Great Britain)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5_road_(Great_Britain)"},{"name":"A6 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A6_road_(England)"},{"name":"A12 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A12_road_(England)"},{"name":"American International Group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communities,_regions_and_language_areas_of_Belgium"},{"name":"Structural motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_motif"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Biosafety level","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Mazda Wankel engine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_Wankel_engine"},{"name":"Page layout","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_layout"},{"name":"Subdomain","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain"}]}
