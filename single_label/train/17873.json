{"id":17873,"title":"Therapeutic microbes for infectious disease.","abstract":"The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has invoked concerns of our current limitations in controlling the spread of infectious disease. To resolve this, we have applied synthetic biology principles to engineer human commensal microbe that can specifically sense and kill an antibiotic-resistant strain of P. aeruginosa. In this chapter, we describe the methods used to assemble, characterize, and evaluate the effectiveness of our engineered microbe in multicellular systems.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838883","annotations":[{"name":"Synthetic biology","weight":0.912945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology"},{"name":"Commensalism","weight":0.892155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Multicellular organism","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.696416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.622531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.481715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.474442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Engineer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"}]}
