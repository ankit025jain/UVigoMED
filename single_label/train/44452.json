{"id":44452,"title":"[Plasma scavenger receptor BI and CD36 expression change and susceptibility of atherosclerosis in patients post liver transplantation].","abstract":"To explore the association between expression changes of plasma macrophages scavenger receptor (SR)-BI and CD36 and risk of arteriosclerosis in end-stage liver disease (ESLD) patients post liver transplantation.A total of 20 liver transplantation patients were included. Clinical data including blood pressure, blood lipid, blood glucose, incidence of new-onset cardiovascular events were obtained. Plasma macrophages scavenger receptor SR-BIand CD36 expressions were detected by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western-blot before and at 1 year after liver transplantation.The serum levels of TC [(5.34 ± 0.87) mmol/L vs. (4.27 ± 0.91) mmol/L], TG [(2.47 ± 0.81) mmol/L vs. (1.02 ± 0.49) mmol/L] and LDL-C [(3.36 ± 0.67) mmol/L vs. (2.14 ± 0.74) mmol/L] were significantly increased (P < 0.05) while the serum level of HDL-C [(0.98 ± 0.84) mmol/L vs. (1.58 ± 0.34) mmol/L] was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) at 1 year post transplantation compared to before-transplantation levels. One patient developed non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, another patient developed atrial fibrillation at one year after transplantation. The plasma mRNA expression of SR-BI was reduced (20.44 ± 0.60 vs. 23.12 ± 0.69, P < 0.05) while the expression of CD36 mRNA was upregulated (20.91 ± 0.35 vs. 18.55 ± 0.62, P < 0.05) at 1 year after liver transplantation compare with that of before the transplantation. Similarly, the plasma protein expression of SR-BIwas reduced (0.21 ± 0.13 vs. 0.64 ± 0.28, P < 0.05) while the protein expression of CD36 was upregulated (0.94 ± 0.13 vs. 0.42 ± 0.19, P < 0.05) at 1 year after liver transplantation compare with that of before the transplantation.Plasma expression changes of SR-BI and CD36 might contribute to the dyslipidemia and contribute to the atherosclerosis susceptibility after liver transplantation.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System
