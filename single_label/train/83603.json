{"id":83603,"title":"Low post-operative mortality after surgery on patients with screening-detected abdominal aortic aneurysms: a Swedvasc registry study.","abstract":"Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) substantially reduces aneurysm-related mortality in men and is increasing worldwide. This cohort study compares post-operative mortality and complications in men with screening-detected vs. non-screening-detected AAAs.Data were extracted from the Swedish National Registry for Vascular Surgery (Swedvasc) for all screening-detected men treated for AAA (n = 350) and age-matched controls treated for non-screening-detected AAA (n = 350).There were no differences in baseline characteristics besides age, which was lower in the screening-detected group than in the non-screening-detected group (median 66 vs. 68, p < .001). Open repair was used more frequently than endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in patients with screening-detected AAAs than in non-screening-detected controls (56% vs. 45% p = .005). No differences in major post-operative complications at 30 days were observed between the groups. In patients treated with open repair there were no differences in 30-day, 90-day or 1-year mortality in screening-detected patients compared to non-screening-detected controls (1.0% vs. 3.2% p = .25, 2.1% vs. 4.5% p = .23, 4.1% vs. 5.8% p = .61). None of the patients treated with EVAR in either group died within 30 days. The 90-day mortality after EVAR was lower in patients with screening-detected AAA than in those with non-screening-detected AAAs (0.0% vs. 3.1%, p = .04). No difference in the 1-year mortality was detected in the EVAR-patients between the two groups (1.4% vs. 4.7%, p = .12).The contemporary post-operative mortality after AAA surgery was low in this national audit of patients with screening-detected AAAs and age-matched controls. Patients with screening-detected AAAs have the same frequency of complications at 30 days as patients with non-screening-detected AAA. This study gives further support to national screening programs for the detection of AAA in men.","date":"2014-12-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25301773","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.672859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.632144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.213398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vascular surgery","weight":0.163187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_surgery"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Amateur Athletic Association of England","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Athletic_Association_of_England"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Registry_of_Emergency_Medical_Technicians"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
