{"id":89607,"title":"Osteoporosis screening and treatment among veterans with recent fracture after implementation of an electronic consult service.","abstract":"Fewer than 24% of Veterans received appropriate evaluation and/or treatment for osteoporosis within 6 months of an index fracture. An electronic consult (E-consult) service was implemented at three Veterans Affairs Medical Centers to facilitate the identification of and recommend management for patients with recent fracture. The E-consult service used clinical encounter data based on ICD9 diagnosis codes to prospectively identify patients with potential osteoporotic fractures. Eligible patients' medical records were reviewed by a metabolic bone specialist, and an E-consult note was sent to the patient's primary provider with specific recommendations for further management. Recommendations were initiated at the provider's discretion. Between 2011 and 2013, the E-consult service identified 444 eligible patients with a low-trauma fracture who were not already on treatment. One hundred twenty-nine (29.1%) consults recommended immediate bisphosphonate treatment, and 258 (58.1%) recommended bone density assessments. Primary providers responded by prescribing bisphosphonates in 74 patients (57.4%) and by ordering bone density testing in 183 (70.9%) patients. At the facility level, prior to implementation of the E-consult service, the rate of osteoporosis treatment following a fracture was 4.8% for bisphosphonates and 21.3% for calcium/vitamin D. After implementation, the treatment rate increased to 7.3% for bisphosphonates (p = 0.02) and 35.2% for calcium/vitamin D (p < 0.01). While feasible and relatively low-cost, an E-consult service modestly improved the rate of osteoporosis treatment among patients with a recent fracture. These results suggest that a program with direct patient interaction is probably required to substantially improve treatment rates.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699797","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Primary care physician","weight":0.513243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.443471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.44,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Diagnosis codes","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_codes"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0994293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"258","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/258"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Discretion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretion"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Veteran","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
