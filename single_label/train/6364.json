{"id":6364,"title":"Ascending aortic constriction in rats for creation of pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy model.","abstract":"Ascending aortic constriction is the most common and successful surgical model for creating pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Here, we describe a detailed surgical procedure for creating pressure overload and cardiac hypertrophy in rats by constriction of the ascending aorta using a small metallic clip. After anesthesia, the trachea is intubated by inserting a cannula through a half way incision made between two cartilage rings of trachea. Then a skin incision is made at the level of the second intercostal space on the left chest wall and muscle layers are cleared to locate the ascending portion of aorta. The ascending aorta is constricted to 50-60% of its original diameter by application of a small sized titanium clip. Following aortic constriction, the second and third ribs are approximated with prolene sutures. The tracheal cannula is removed once spontaneous breathing was re-established. The animal is allowed to recover on the heating pad by gradually lowering anesthesia. The intensity of pressure overload created by constriction of the ascending aorta is determined by recording the pressure gradient using trans-thoracic two dimensional Doppler-echocardiography. Overall this protocol is useful to study the remodeling events and contractile properties of the heart during the gradual onset and progression from compensated cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure stage.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998889","annotations":[{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.85303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.796984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Intercostal space","weight":0.78417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_space"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.724923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.558923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.538832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.4816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.225409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.122553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Heating pad","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_pad"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Intercostal muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_muscle"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Ascending colon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_colon"}]}
