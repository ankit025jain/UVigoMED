{"id":52995,"title":"Global distribution pattern of histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer: a database analysis and systematic review.","abstract":"Epithelial ovarian cancer is basically a heterogeneous disease with different chemosensitivity and distinct molecular alternations for each histological subtype. In order to assess whether the results of clinical trials can be extrapolated to a new country, it is critical to first examine whether the relative frequencies is homogenous across countries.Cancer registry database from a single institution in Taiwan combined with systematic review of the global literature on the relative frequencies of histological subtypes between 2003 and 2012 was provided.Of 175 titles identified, 41 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Globally, for each subtype, the median value of relative frequencies for serous subtype was 45.0%, with the Philippines (16.0%), Indonesia (22.7%), and Brazil (30.1%) as the three lowest countries and South Africa (68.0%), Greece (71.5%), and India (86.7%) as the three highest countries; for mucinous subtype, 11.4%, Italy (3.0%), Australia (3.4%), and Japan (5.4%) were the three lowest countries, while Indonesia (29.1%), Singapore (30.3%), and South Korea (38.6%) were the three highest countries; for endometrioid subtype, 12.6%, India (1.6%), Greece (5.7%), and Portugal (7.6%) were the three lowest countries, while Taiwan (24.8%), Egypt (25.0%), and Austria (25.5%) were the three highest countries; and for clear cell subtype, 5.3%, Pakistan (1.0%), Iran (2.0%), and Brazil (2.1%) were the three lowest countries while Thailand (16.0%), Taiwan (16.8%), and Spain (18.8%) were the three highest countries.Relative frequencies of subtypes were not homogenous across countries. This diversity may reflect the geographical and ethnic variations. Globally, epithelial ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a heterogeneous distribution pattern.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System
