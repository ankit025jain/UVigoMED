{"id":72275,"title":"Transcriptional activation of OCT4 by the ETS transcription factor PEA3 in NCCIT human embryonic carcinoma cells.","abstract":"We examined the molecular mechanism of OCT4 gene regulation by polyomavirus enhancer activator 3 (PEA3) in NCCIT cells. Endogenous PEA3 and OCT4 were significantly elevated in undifferentiated cells and reduced upon differentiation. PEA3 knockdown led to a reduction in OCT4 levels. OCT4 promoter activity was significantly up-regulated by dose-dependent PEA3 overexpression. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the OCT4 promoter revealed a putative binding site within the conserved region 2 (CR2). PEA3 interacted with the binding element within CR2 in NCCIT cells. This study reveals the molecular details of the mechanism by which the oncogenic factor PEA3 regulates OCT4 gene expression as a transcriptional activator.
