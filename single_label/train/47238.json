{"id":47238,"title":"[Clinicopathological characteristics and generational changes in metachronous gastric cancer of the reconstructed gastric tube].","abstract":"This study investigated gastric tube cancer (GTC) to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics in different generations. We analyzed 165 cases with metachronous GTC; 9 cases from our institution and 156 from reported Japanese cases. Cases were divided into 3 groups to provide a detailed analysis of age-specific variations. GTC most commonly occurred in the lower gastric tube, and the most common histological type was tubular adenocarcinoma (70%). There were no age-related variations in the site and histological type of GTC. The incidence rate of endoscopic detection increased from 2003 to 74% in 2012, and the incidence of early GTC detection also significantly increased in this period. The rate of endoscopic treatment before 2003 was approximately 20%, and it doubled over the 10-year course of the study. The recent progress made in the diagnosis and treatment of GTC may have contributed to an improvement in its prognosis.
