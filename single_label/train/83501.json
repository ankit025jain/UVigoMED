{"id":83501,"title":"Effects of chronic administration of ethanolic extract of kolanut (Cola nitida) and caffeine on vascular function.","abstract":"Kolanut (Cola nitida) is consumed in virtually every part of the world. The caffeine content of kolanut is scarce and the number of investigations studying the health benefits of kolanut is negligible compared to coffee.The present study was designed to identify the caffeine content of kolanut and evaluate the effect of its chronic consumption on cardiovascular functions in rats.The caffeine content of kolanut was determined by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups (10 Rats/group). Kolanut extract (11.9 mg/kg), caffeine extracted from kolanut (7.5 mg/kg), decaffeinated of kolanut extract (6 mg/kg) and distilled water (control) was administered orally to each group for six-weeks. Effect of treatment on body weight, blood pressure and relaxation response to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) of the aortic rings was assessed.The total caffeine content of kolanut extract was found to be 51% and it was 96% pure from GC-MS analysis. Chronic consumption of kolanut and caffeine significantly (p < 0.05) decreased body weight. Similarly, kolanut extract decaffeinated kolanut and caffeine significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the contractile response to noradrenaline and higher potassium solution. Kolanut extract and caffeine also significantly (p < 0.05) increased the mean arterial blood pressure. Caffeine and kolanut consumption reduced the relaxation response to both acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Atropine and L-NAME considerably inhibit the ACh-induced relaxation of the rat aortic ring suggesting the involvement of cholinergic mechanism. However, indomethacin (10(-4)M) also attenuated the ACh response indicating involvement of protanoids.The results suggest that treatment with both kolanut extract and caffeine had similar characteristics between the two groups with no significant differences in the ACh-induced relaxation of thering suggesting that the action of kolanut extract is due to its caffeine content.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335374","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium
