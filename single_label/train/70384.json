{"id":70384,"title":"Upper extremity considerations for oncologic surgery.","abstract":"It was estimated that more than 3000 people would be diagnosed with a primary bone or joint malignancy and more than 11,000 people would be diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma in 2013. Although primary bone and soft tissue tumors of the upper extremity are infrequent, it is imperative that the clinician be familiar with a systematic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions to prevent inadvertently compromising patient outcome. With advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, tumor imaging, and surgical reconstructive options, limb salvage surgery is estimated to be feasible in 95% of extremity bone or soft tissue sarcomas.
