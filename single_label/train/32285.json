{"id":32285,"title":"[Difficult airway management using the air-Q in a patient with Klippel-Feil syndrome].","abstract":"Patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) frequently encounter difficult airway management due to skeletal abnormalities, including fusion of two or more vertebrae and short neck. We report successful tracheal intubation using the air-Q supraglottic airway device (air-Q). A 46-year-old woman (height, 149 cm; weight, 62 kg) with KFS was scheduled to undergo vertebral arch plasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. She could open her mouth sufficiently but could not tilt her head due to C1-3 fusion. Following administration of fentanyl 100 microg and propofol 120 mg, mask ventilation was achieved with jaw thrust maneuver. We then administered rocuronium 50 mg for immobilization and attempted tracheal intubation using the Pentax-AWS Airwayscope with a thin pediatric Intlock. However, we could not target the glottis, and ventilation via a size 3 i-gel or size 3.5 air-Q was unsuccessful. Using a size 2.5 air-Q, sufficient ventilation was finally achieved. We performed fiberoptic tracheal intubation through the air-Q using a tube with an internal diameter of 6.0-mm. We then exchanged the 6.0-mm tracheal tube with a 7.0-mm spiral tube using a 10 Fr tracheal tube introducer.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979859","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.741366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.739178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.604798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.567881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.538646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.453168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.389179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.311111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.201785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Airway management","weight":0.169978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_management"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Rocuronium bromide","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocuronium_bromide"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Myelopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelopathy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Thrust","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Spiral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"IEC 60320 C13","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320_C13"},{"name":"Weightlifting at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 62 kg","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlifting_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_-_Men's_62_kg"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Vertebral arch","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 46","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_46"}]}
