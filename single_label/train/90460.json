{"id":90460,"title":"Zone I extensor reconstruction with tendon salvaged from another finger.","abstract":"Laceration, crush, and avulsion injuries are common acute extensor tendon injuries. Simple lacerations may often be repaired in the emergency room, but crush or avulsion injuries may involve tendon loss and gaps in the extensor tendons. Reconstruction can be difficult. The purpose of this article is to present a salvage technique for reconstruction of large extensor tendon gaps in extensor zone I in patients with severe injuries to multiple fingers. This technique, in which a tendon is transplanted from an unsalvageable finger to another with a terminal tendon gap in the same patient, may be a reasonable remedy for reconstruction of tendon loss or gaps and may offer advantages over other traditional reconstructive techniques in certain cases.
