{"id":51723,"title":"The role of the robotic-assisted transaxillary gasless approach for the removal of parathyroid adenomas.","abstract":"We sought to describe a robotic technique of transaxillary gasless parathyroidectomy for the management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) due to a parathyroid adenoma.All consecutive patients who underwent robotic parathyroidectomy for a parathyroid adenoma by a single surgeon were included. Data was obtained by a retrospective review of patients' medical charts.Nine patients with confirmed PHPT underwent robotic parathyroidectomy. Curative resection was established in all patients with the aid of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring. One patient required bilateral cervical exploration of multiglandular disease. There were no complications. Patients were followed up for a period exceeding 6 months without any evidence of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.Our initial experience demonstrates that this technique is safe and effective for the treatment of PHPT. We believe that the use of robotic technology for endoscopic parathyroid surgeries could overcome the limitations of conventional techniques in the management of parathyroid lesions.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662482","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.810624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.665947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.590836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Parathyroidectomy","weight":0.576261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroidectomy"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.537873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.488317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.443471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.279473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.19843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Primary hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Envelope detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_detector"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
