{"id":26679,"title":"Association between alcohol consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.","abstract":"To conduct a meta-analysis summarizing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality (ACM) in relation to alcohol consumption in patients with hypertension, focusing on clarifying dose-response associations.PubMed and EMBASE were searched for eligible prospective cohort studies from December 3, 1949, through January 18, 2014. The semi-parameter method and dose-response analysis were used.Nine studies (11 cohorts) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with the lowest alcohol level (abstainers/occasional drinkers), the pooled relative risk (RR) was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.77) for the third highest category (median, 10 g/d), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.93) for the second highest category (median, 20 g/d), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.54-0.67) for the highest category (median, 30 g/d). A J-shaped relationship between alcohol use and ACM was observed, and the nadir (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88) was found to be at a dose of 8 to 10 g of alcohol consumption per day.Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that low-to-moderate alcohol consumption was inversely significantly associated with the risk of CVD and ACM in patients with hypertension.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091872","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.740423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.553664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.544661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.264101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.196893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Long-term effects of alcohol","weight":0.137625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_alcohol"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Alcohol by volume","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"December 3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_3"},{"name":"January 18","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_18"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"680","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/680"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Association for Computing Machinery","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery"}]}
