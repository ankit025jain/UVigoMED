{"id":23785,"title":"Disseminated tuberculosis in 2 children with inflammatory bowel disease receiving infliximab.","abstract":"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are predisposed to opportunistic infections. We report 2 cases of disseminated tuberculosis in adolescents receiving a TNF antagonist, infliximab. Both had negative baseline tuberculin skin tests. Multimodal testing using tuberculin skin tests and interferon gamma release assays at the time of inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis and annually may increase the sensitivity of LTBI testing in these high risk children.
