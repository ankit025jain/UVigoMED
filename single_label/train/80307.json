{"id":80307,"title":"Severe whipworm (Trichuris spp.) infection in the dromedary (Camelus dromedarius).","abstract":"One adult (13-yr-old) and two young (3-4-yr-old) male dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) from the Seoul Zoo displayed anorexia and chronic diarrhea for 2 wk. Direct fecal smear examination revealed Trichuris spp. infection. After confirmation of the infection, fenbendazole was orally administered as a suspension; this was repeated two times at 3-wk intervals. A high initial dose (20 mg/kg) was followed by administration at the recommended dose (10 mg/kg). Starting on the day following the first treatment, a large number of adult whipworms were discharged with the feces over a 3-day period. Two young male dromedary camels gradually recovered. However, the adult male dromedary camel developed continuous bloody mucoid diarrhea and died 2 days after treatment. Postmortem examination revealed that numerous whipworms were attached to the mucosa throughout the large intestine.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712184","annotations":[{"name":"Stool test","weight":0.811156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stool_test"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Large intestine","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.710663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.690481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trichuris trichiura","weight":0.565716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris_trichiura"},{"name":"Camel","weight":0.557586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel"},{"name":"Fenbendazole","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenbendazole"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.386839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.370077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Dromedary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromedary"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Seoul","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Trichinosis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Zoo","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
