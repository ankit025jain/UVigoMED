{"id":62883,"title":"Omacetaxine: a protein translation inhibitor for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","abstract":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is driven by the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, which is a result of a (9;22) chromosomal translocation. Imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKI) have revolutionized how CML is treated. Although the majority of patients respond to these kinase inhibitors, a subset becomes resistant to these therapeutics. Synribo (omacetaxine mepesuccinate) was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Philadelphia-positive CML either in the chronic or the accelerated phase whose disease failed two prior TKIs. With omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days during induction and for 7 days during maintenance, a major cytogenetic response occurred in 20% of patients in the chronic phase and major hematologic response in 27% of patients in the accelerated phase. Laboratory investigations unraveled the mechanism of action and effectiveness of this agent. Bcr-Abl protein is intrinsically programmed to turn over with a short half-life that makes it susceptible to protein translation inhibitors. Omacetaxine (homoharringtonine) inhibits total protein biosynthesis by binding to A-site cleft of ribosomes. As a corollary to this action, there is a diminution of short-lived proteins, such as Bcr-Abl, followed by cell death. Approval of this first-in-class protein translation inhibitor opens up new avenues for its use in other diseases as well as mechanism-based combinations.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501394","annotations":[{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Protein biosynthesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Dasatinib","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Omacetaxine mepesuccinate","weight":0.72151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omacetaxine_mepesuccinate"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.690841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.655844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Nilotinib","weight":0.622951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilotinib"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.599309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.442624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.388451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.364981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.12281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"}]}
