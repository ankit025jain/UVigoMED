{"id":62805,"title":"Hodgkin's variant of Richter transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia; a retrospective study from the Israeli CLL study group.","abstract":"Richter syndrome (RS) is the development of an aggressive lymphoid malignancy, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Most are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), however in 10-15% of RS, there is transformation to Hodgkin lymphoma, termed \"Hodgkin variant\" (HV). In the present retrospective study we summarize the Israeli experience with HV-RS, and analyze demographic data, relevant laboratory and clinical parameters, and outcome.We collected and analyzed data from 119 patients with RS from 12 Centers in Israel during 1996-2010 and identified 16 cases with \"Hodgkin's variant\".The median age was 58 years, and 67% were males. The median time from CLL diagnosis to development of HV was 5.9 (range=0.8-11.9) years and the median survival was 39.5 months, compared to 9 months for the cases with RS-DLBCL.Hodgkin variant appears to differ from DLBCL-RS and is clinically less aggressive. However, compared to de novo Hodgkin's lymphoma, HV-RS has a worse prognosis.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511013","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.751055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.484501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.455312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.439916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.354764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Richter's transformation","weight":0.231639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter's_transformation"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"}]}
