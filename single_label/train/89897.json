{"id":89897,"title":"[Clinical analysis of foreign body ingestion of button cell in children].","abstract":"To improve diagnosis and treatment level of foreign body ingestion of button cell in children.Among the 14 cases with foreign bodies ingestion of button cell, 6 cases in esophageal, 7 cases in stomach and lower gastrointestinal tract, 1 case with multiple foreign bodies both in esophagus and stomach. Seven cases in stomach and lower gastrointestinal tract were closely observed without special treatment, 6 cases in esophageal, underwent esophagoscopy and removal of foreign body under general anesthesia, 1 case with multiple foreign bodies in esophagus and stomach underwent esophagoscopy and electronic gastroscopy and then removal of foreign body. All patients had symptomatic treatments after removal of foreign body. The average age is 2 years and 1 month.After the removal of button cell, Foreign bodies in stomach and lower gastrointestinal tract in 7 cases were all discharged spontaneously. For the 6 cases in esophagus, 4 cases were cured, 1 case had esophageal stricture, 1 cased died. 1 case with multiple foreign bodies in both esophagus and stomach was cured.Esophageal foreign body has strong corrosiveness and would cause serious damages even to threaten children's life. It also may lead to esophageal stricture. The key point to cure this disease is to diagnose timely and to operate as soon as possible. Because neutralize of digestive juices and low probability of incarceration, with close observation, the foreign bodies of stomach and lower gastrointestinal tract can discharge spontaneously.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669693","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Gastric acid","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.697106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.553729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.403807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Esophageal stricture","weight":0.356468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_stricture"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.235055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Juice","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Corrosive substance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosive_substance"},{"name":"Button cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_cell"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Incarceration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration"}]}
