{"id":83586,"title":"[Strategy of transfusion in cardiac and aortic surgery].","abstract":"Current trend in transfusion is a decreasing of the donor's blood use due to possible complications. The article deals with analysis of intraoperative blood loss in different surgeries on the heart and aorta and of a role of blood-saving factors in decreasing of the donor's blood transfusion. We found a correlation between the blood components need and type of surgery and assessed a preoperative provision of autoplasma and intraoperative autohemotransfusion with a blood sampling from the right atrium before the beginning of artificial circulation (Complex use of the blood-saving methods with a prophylactics and treatment of hemostasis disturbances allowed the significantly decreasing of the donor's blood use. 50-70% of patients did not receive components of the donor's blood during cardiac surgery.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306676","annotations":[{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Right atrium","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_atrium"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.782643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.760512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.720973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0531412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Blood product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_product"}]}
