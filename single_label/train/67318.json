{"id":67318,"title":"Pre-screening age African-American males: what do they know about prostate cancer screening, knowledge, and risk perceptions?","abstract":"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the second most common cause of cancer mortality among men in America. African-American men have a mortality rate from prostate cancer twice that of Caucasian men. Although prostate screening remains controversial, it provides an opportunity for the cancer to be detected early when treatment is most effective. Limited research has been conducted regarding prostate cancer awareness and knowledge among African-American men under 50. This article highlights a pilot study assessing the knowledge, attitudes, risk perceptions, and reasons for participating in prostate cancer screening among African-American males between the ages of 30-45. Study findings suggest these participants recognized an awareness of risk factors associated with the disease, yet underestimated their risk of developing the disease. Additionally they present uneven knowledge of the prostate and its function and possess positive perceptions of their general health beliefs and practices. Practice implications and directions for future research regarding prostate cancer among this population are highlighted.
