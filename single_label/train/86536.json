{"id":86536,"title":"Thoracoscopic lobectomy is associated with acceptable morbidity and mortality in patients with predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second or diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide less than 40% of normal.","abstract":"A predicted postoperative (ppo) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%) or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) of <40% has traditionally been considered to convey a high risk of lobectomy owing to elevated postoperative morbidity and mortality. These recommendations, however, were largely derived from the pre-video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) era. We hypothesized that VATS lobectomy would be associated with acceptable morbidity and mortality at ppoFEV1% and ppoDLCO% values < 40%.PpoFEV1% and ppoDLCO% were calculated for patients undergoing open or VATS lobectomy for lung cancer in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic database from 2009 to 2011. Univariate comparisons, multivariate analyses, and 1:1 propensity matching were performed.A total of 13,376 patients underwent lobectomy (50.9% open, 49.1% VATS). A decreased ppoFEV1% and ppoDLCO% were each independent predictors for both cardiopulmonary complications and mortality in the open group (all P ? .008). In the VATS group, ppoFEV1% was an independent predictor of complications (P = .001) but not mortality (P = .77), and ppoDLCO% was an independent predictor of complications (P = .046) and mortality (P = .008). With decreasing ppoFEV1% or ppoDLCO%, complications and mortality increased at a greater rate in the open lobectomy than in a propensity-matched VATS group (n = 4215 each). For patients with ppoFEV1% < 40%, mortality was greater in the open (4.8%) than in the matched VATS group (0.7%, P = .003). Similar results were seen for ppoDLCO% < 40% (5.2% open, 2.0% VATS, P = .003). The rate of complications was significantly greater at ppoFEV1% < 40% in the open (21.9%) than in the matched VATS (12.8%, P = .005) group and similar results were seen with ppoDLCO% < 40% (14.9% open, 10.4% VATS, P = .016).VATS lobectomy can be performed with acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with reduced ppoFEV1% or ppoDLCO%.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766848","annotations":[{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.751574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.663545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.580762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.523919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.497384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.320456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.303706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"VATS lobectomy","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VATS_lobectomy"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.113797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"DLCO","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLCO"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
