{"id":80052,"title":"[Influence factors of Schistosoma japonicum infection among fishermen in eastern Dongting Lake Region].","abstract":"To investigate schistosome infection among the professional fishermen in Yueyang County, East Dongting Lake Region and its influence factors.A total of 275 fishermen from two fisherman villages in Yueyang County were selected in 2009. They were investigated by fecal examination and questionnairing. The stool-egg positive individuals were detected by B ultrasound. The multivariate unconditional Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the related factors of schistosome infection and liver in fishermen.The total infection rate in fishermen was 40.4% (111/275), and the geometric mean of EPG was 17.4 +/- 4.4. B ultrasound data showed among 111 egg positive individuals, 39 (35.1%) cases manifested as hepatomegaly, 22 (19.8%) had splenomegaly, 11 (9.9%) had portal vein expansion and 65 (58.6%) had hepatic fibrosis. Multivariate unconditional Logistic regression analysis showed that age groups (OR = 0.630), fishing working years (OR = 2.470), chemotherapy frequency (OR = 0.425) and chemotherapy in 2008 (OR = 0.290) were the influence factors on schistosome infection (P < 0.01).Schistosome infection rate is high, Schistosoma japonicum-induced liver and spleen injuries are still severe in fisherman of Eastern Dongting Lake Region.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812884","annotations":[{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Hepatomegaly","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatomegaly"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.298991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.266938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Geometric mean","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Dongting Lake","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongting_Lake"},{"name":"Yueyang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yueyang"},{"name":"Electronic program guide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_program_guide"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Fishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/275"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Fisherman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 425","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_425"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"470 (dinghy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/470_(dinghy)"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"}]}
