{"id":11125,"title":"Rat chronic glaucoma model induced by intracameral injection of microbeads suspended in sodium sulfate-sodium hyaluronate.","abstract":"To establish a rat glaucoma model with chronic intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation induced by microbeads suspended in sodium sulfate-sodium hyaluronate.Chronic elevation of IOP was induced unilaterally by injecting polystyrene microbeads, suspended in 4 % sodium sulfate and 3 % sodium hyaluronate, into the anterior chamber. The microbead suspension was injected through either the clear corneal (CC) or sclerocorneal (SC) tunnel. IOP changes were monitored up to 8 weeks after injection. The loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was assessed using fluorogold retrograde labeling of RGCs. RGC axons were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting.The resulting IOP elevation was maintained up to 3 weeks after the intracameral injection of microbeads through the CC route and up to 4 weeks after injection through the SC route. The density of RGCs was significantly reduced at 4 weeks after injection, with the SC route leading to more RGC loss than the CC route (p = 0.037). The neurofilament immunoreactivity and protein levels in the optic nerve were also significantly reduced at 4 weeks after injection. Some eyes in the SC route cohort received re-injection of the microbead suspension at 4 weeks after the initial injection, which led to an elevated IOP more than 8 weeks after the initial injection, and eventually a 27.5 % loss of RGC density compared with the control eyes.The intracameral injection of microbeads suspended in hyaluronate effectively produced chronic IOP elevation and subsequent RGC degeneration in rat eyes. The sclerocorneal tunnel approach yielded a longer period of IOP elevation than the clear corneal approach. Our modified microbead injection offers a reliable high-pressure glaucoma model.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610540","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Optic nerve","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Retinal ganglion cell","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Ganglion cell","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Neurofilament","weight":0.622669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofilament"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.617316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.567719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.560295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.538257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.537563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.42759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.330082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.243717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.189263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Ganglion cell layer","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell_layer"},{"name":"Polystyrene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene"},{"name":"Sodium sulfate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_sulfate"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
