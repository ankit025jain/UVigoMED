{"id":90237,"title":"Effects of adjuvant exemestane versus anastrozole on bone mineral density for women with early breast cancer (MA.27B): a companion analysis of a randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"Treatment of breast cancer with aromatase inhibitors is associated with damage to bones. NCIC CTG MA.27 was an open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial in which women with breast cancer were assigned to one of two adjuvant oral aromatase inhibitors-exemestane or anastrozole. We postulated that exemestane-a mildly androgenic steroid-might have a less detrimental effect on bone than non-steroidal anastrozole. In this companion study to MA.27, we compared changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine and total hip between patients treated with exemestane and patients treated with anastrozole.Between April 24, 2006, and May 30, 2008, 300 patients with baseline T-scores of -2·0 or more were accrued (147 allocated exemestane, 153 anastrozole); and 197 patients with baseline T-scores of less than -2·0 (101 exemestane, 96 anastrozole). For patients with T-scores greater than -2·0 at baseline, mean change of bone mineral density in the spine at 2 years did not differ significantly between patients taking exemestane and patients taking anastrozole (-0·92%, 95% CI -2·35 to 0·50 vs -2·39%, 95% CI -3·77 to -1·01; p=0·08). Respective mean loss in the hip was -1·93% (95% CI -2·93 to -0·93) versus -2·71% (95% CI -4·32 to -1·11; p=0·10). Likewise for those who started with T-scores of less than -2·0, mean change of spine bone mineral density at 2 years did not differ significantly between the exemestane and anastrozole treatment groups (2·11%, 95% CI -0·84 to 5·06 vs 3·72%, 95% CI 1·54 to 5·89; p=0·26), nor did hip bone mineral density (2·09%, 95% CI -1·45 to 5·63 vs 0·0%, 95% CI -3·67 to 3·66; p=0·28). Patients with baseline T-score of -2·0 or more taking exemestane had two fragility fractures and two other fractures, those taking anastrozole had three fragility fractures and five other fractures. For patients who had baseline T-scores of less than -2·0 taking exemestane, one had a fragility fracture and four had other fractures, whereas those taking anastrozole had five fragility fractures and one other fracture.Our results demonstrate that adjuvant treatment with aromatase inhibitors can be considered for breast cancer patients who have T-scores less than -2·0.Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute, Pfizer, Canadian Institutes of Health Research.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636210","annotations":[{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.911714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Aromatase inhibitor","weight":0.829848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pfizer","weight":0.761605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.730883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.619889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.461565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.284698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.258004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Exemestane","weight":0.201923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exemestane"},{"name":"Anastrozole","weight":0.183228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastrozole"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.123833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Hip bone","weight":0.0427344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_bone"},{"name":"Canadian Institutes of Health Research","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
