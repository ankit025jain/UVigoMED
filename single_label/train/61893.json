{"id":61893,"title":"Bone marrow plasma macrophage inflammatory protein protein-1 alpha(MIP-1 alpha) and sclerostin in multiple myeloma: relationship with bone disease and clinical characteristics.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of MIP-1 alpha and sclerostin in bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), the possible association of the sclerostin and MIP-1 alpha with MBD and the clinical characteristics. 53 patients (29 M, 24 F), median age 64 years was studied. MIP-1 alpha, sclerostin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) levels were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sclerostin and MIP-1 alpha mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. PTH and 1,25(OH) 2D3 levels were measured with an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The sclerostin and MIP-1 alpha concentrations in patients with MM were higher than those in the controls. RT-PCR analysis verified that the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of most patients showed sclerostin and MIP-1 alpha mRNA expression. The sclerostin and MIP-1 alpha levels in patients with ISS stage III disease were significantly higher than those in patients with ISS stage II disease (p=0.01 and 0.06). The sclerostin and MIP-1 alpha levels in patients with BMD in group C were significantly higher than those in group A+B. There was positive correlation between sclerostin levels and MIP-1 alpha, beta2-microglobulin and aCa levels. A negative association was seen between sclerostin levels and bALP, HB and ALB levels. The MM patients with high sclerostin levels (>0.72 ng/ml) had significantly shorter median survival than those with low sclerostin levels (?0.72 ng/ml) (?(2)=7.574, p=0.006). Our findings support the positive relationship between sclerostin levels and MIP-1alpha levels deserve further detailed research.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
