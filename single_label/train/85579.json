{"id":85579,"title":"Serum uric acid and the risk of respiratory disease: a population-based cohort study.","abstract":"Uric acid is the most abundant molecule with antioxidant properties found in human blood serum. We examined the relationship between serum uric acid and the incidence of respiratory disease including any effect modification by smoking status.A cohort with serum uric acid measured between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2012 was extracted from The Health Improvement Network primary care research database. New diagnoses of COPD and lung cancer were ascertained based on diagnostic codes entered into the medical records.During 1?002?496 person years (PYs) of follow-up, there were 3901 COPD diagnoses and 1015 cases of lung cancer. After multivariable adjustment, strong interactions with smoking status were detected (p<0.001) for both outcomes with significant negative relationships between serum uric acid and respiratory disease for current smokers but no strong relationships for never-smokers or ex-smokers. The relationships were strongest for lung cancer in heavy smokers (?20 cigarettes per day) with predicted incidence rates 97 per 10?000 PYs (95% CI 68 to 126) in the lowest serum uric acid quintile (100-250?µmol/L) compared with a predicted 28 per 10?000 PYs (95% CI 14 to 41) in the highest quintile (438-700?µmol/L).Low levels of serum uric acid are associated with higher rates of COPD and lung cancer in current smokers after accounting for conventional risk factors.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24904021","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.825046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.798635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.780965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.764248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.751436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.728091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.717121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.709114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.686347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.624632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.607141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.591962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.587328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.56297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.296238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Diagnosis codes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_codes"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Strong interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction"}]}
