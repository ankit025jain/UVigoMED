{"id":62329,"title":"Pretransplant administration of imatinib for allo-HSCT in patients with BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","abstract":"We aimed to evaluate the impact of pretransplant imatinib administration on the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We retrospectively analyzed 738 patients with Ph(+) ALL that underwent allo-HSCT between 1990 and 2010 using data from the Transplant Registry Unified Management Program of the Japan Society of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. We compared the allo-HSCT outcomes between 542 patients who received imatinib before allo-HSCT during the initial complete remission period (imatinib cohort) and 196 patients who did not receive imatinib (non-imatinib cohort). The 5-year overall survival after allo-HSCT was significantly higher in the imatinib cohort than in the non-imatinib cohort (59% vs 38%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31-45%; P < .001). Multivariate analysis indicated that pretransplant imatinib administration had beneficial effects on overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.77; P < .001), relapse (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.43-0.99; P = .048), and nonrelapse mortality (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.83; P = .005). In conclusion, our study showed that imatinib administration before allo-HSCT had advantageous effects on the clinical outcomes of allo-HSCT in patients with Ph(+) ALL.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591204","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.912077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.735604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.630211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.462117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.397914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Philadelphia","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.287041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.263355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"738","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/738"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"370","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/370"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Japan Society (New York)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Society_(New_York)"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
