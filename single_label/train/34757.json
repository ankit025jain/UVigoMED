{"id":34757,"title":"Diagnostic errors in congenital echocardiography: importance of study conditions.","abstract":"Diagnostic errors are unwanted clinical events that place patients at risk for injury. The authors have previously reported that a majority of congenital echocardiography errors have clinical impacts and, on the basis of a small cohort, identified factors associated with diagnostic error. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate patient risk factors for diagnostic errors in a large contemporary cohort and (2) to identify risk factors for situation-related diagnostic errors.Diagnostic errors were identified at a large academic pediatric cardiac center from 2004 to 2011. Clinical and situational variables were collected from diagnostic error cases and controls.Among the 254 diagnostic error cases, 66% affected clinical management or patients experienced adverse events; 77% of errors were preventable or possibly preventable. Coronary arteries, pulmonary veins, and the aortic arch were most commonly involved with diagnostic errors. Multivariate analysis identified the following patient-related risk factors: rare or very rare diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.3; P < .001), high anatomic complexity (AOR, 3.4; P < .001), and weight < 5 kg (AOR, 2.7; P < .001). Risk factors related to the setting of the echocardiographic study included evening or night (7 pm to 6:59 am) study interpretation (AOR, 2.6; P = .005) and weekend studies (Friday through Sunday) (AOR, 1.6; P = .04). The model area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.833.In addition to patient risk factors, the setting of an echocardiographic study and interpretation contribute to risk for a diagnostic error. Studies interpreted overnight or performed during a weekend should be considered for a quality improvement activity to reduce diagnostic errors or their impact.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709004","annotations":[{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.835475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pulmonary vein","weight":0.789566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_vein"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.690296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.568883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.51286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.459522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.446871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.280531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.270737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"}]}
