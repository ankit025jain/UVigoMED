{"id":81051,"title":"Profile of the Trypanosoma cruzi vector infestation in Jaboticatubas, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.","abstract":"This work aimed to analyze the triatomine infestation scenario in Jaboticatubas after 30 years of the uninterrupted actions of the Program of Chagas Disease Control.From 2007 to 2010, household unit infestation was researched, and an exploratory analysis of the localities infested with Panstrongylus megistus was performed.In total, 613 triatomines were captured in 78 households, the majority of which were Panstrongylus megistus and were captured mainly in chicken houses, but they were also found to be colonizing human houses.The epidemiological importance of Panstrongylus megistus was confirmed in Jaboticatubas, and capability to colonize indoors has been demonstrated, as has its proximity to humans. Its distribution is aggregated in the northern and in central-eastern regions of the municipality.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474024","annotations":[{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.651187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Minas Gerais","weight":0.635103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.32545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.287499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Trypanosoma cruzi","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Trypanosoma","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"},{"name":"Panstrongylus","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panstrongylus"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Military organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_organization"},{"name":"Infestation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation"},{"name":"Exploratory data analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis"}]}
