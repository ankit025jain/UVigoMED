{"id":90574,"title":"Olfactory ensheathing cells seeded muscle-stuffed vein as nerve conduit for peripheral nerve repair: a nerve conduction study.","abstract":"We evaluated bridging of 15 mm nerve gap in rat sciatic nerve injury model with muscle-stuffed vein seeded with olfactory ensheathing cells as a substitute for nerve autograft. Neurophysiological recovery, as assessed by electrophysiological analysis was faster in the constructed biological nerve conduit compared to that of autograft.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598302","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Olfaction","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Nerve conduction study","weight":0.732061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_study"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Sciatic nerve","weight":0.562893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.553623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.372615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.222541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"}]}
