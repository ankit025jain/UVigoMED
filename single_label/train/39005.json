{"id":39005,"title":"[Microscopic colitis: update 2014].","abstract":"Microscopic colitis, which includes lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis, represents a frequent cause of chronic watery diarrhea especially in the elderly population. Several medications, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors or antidepressants, as well as cigarette smoking have been recognized as risk factors for microscopic colitis. The diagnosis of microscopic colitis is based on a macroscopically normal ileo-colonoscopy and several biopsies from the entire colon, which demonstrate the pathognomonic histopathologic findings. Therapy is mainly based on the use of budesonide. Other medications, such as mesalazine, cholestyramine and bismuth, have been evaluated as well but the evidence is less solid.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25276996","annotations":[{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.872918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.788896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.728377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Mesalazine","weight":0.70278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesalazine"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.67674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.645925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Cholestyramine","weight":0.629339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestyramine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.601239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Budesonide","weight":0.509598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budesonide"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.498513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Bismuth","weight":0.386382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.38582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.346139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Pathognomonic","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic"},{"name":"Microscopic colitis","weight":0.271135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_colitis"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.22658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.105914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Collagenous colitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagenous_colitis"},{"name":"Lymphocytic colitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytic_colitis"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
