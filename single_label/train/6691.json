{"id":6691,"title":"Grb2-associated binder 1 is essential for cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury.","abstract":"We have shown recently that endothelial Grb-2-associated binder 1 (Gab1), an intracellular scaffolding adaptor, has a protective effect against limb ischemia via mediating angiogenic signaling pathways. However, the role of Gab1 in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unknown. In this study, we show that Gab1 is required for cardioprotection against I/R injury. I/R injury led to remarkable phosphorylation of Gab1 in cardiomyocytes. Compared with controls, the mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Gab1 gene (CGKO mice) exhibited an increase in infarct size and a decrease in cardiac function after I/R injury. Consistently, in hearts of CGKO mice subjected to I/R, the activation of caspase 3 and myocardial apoptosis was markedly enhanced whereas the activation of protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which are critical for cardiomyocyte survival, was attenuated. Oxidative stress is regarded as a major contributor to myocardial I/R injury. To examine the role of Gab1 in oxidative stress directly, isolated adult cardiomyocytes were subject to oxidant hydrogen peroxide and the cardioprotective effects of Gab1 were confirmed. Furthermore, we found that the phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab1-mediated activation of Akt and MAPK by oxidative stress was suppressed by ErbB receptor and Src kinase inhibitors, accompanied by an increase in apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, our results suggest that Gab1 is essential for cardioprotection against I/R oxidative injury via mediating survival signaling.
