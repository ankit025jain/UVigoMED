{"id":84698,"title":"[Interdisciplinary care for a patient suffering from Diogenes syndrome].","abstract":"Interdisciplinarity is the combined care of a patient by two or more healthcare professionals. Taking into account the contribution of the different healthcare partners improves patient follow-up, quality of the care and use of resources. General practitioner (GP) becomes the pivot of a combined interdisciplinary ambulatory care allowing a prolonged staying at home and avoiding the multiplication of care offers. This paper, by the clinical description of a patient suffering from Diogenes Syndrome, allows a cross of the care between the GP, home nurse and pharmacist. It deals with follow-up questions, acceptance, objectives of treatment, communication between healthcare partners and \"false notes\" in the follow-up.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055477","annotations":[{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.746966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.746783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.658635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.2922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Diogenes syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_syndrome"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Multiplication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Crucifix","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifix"}]}
