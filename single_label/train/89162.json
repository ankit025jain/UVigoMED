{"id":89162,"title":"A novel method for the removal of distal part of broken intramedullary femoral nail.","abstract":"We describe a new technique for the removal of the distal part of a broken intramedullary interlocking femoral nail. The distal part of the nail is pushed outward with the help of a antegradely driven new nail. This method is simple, less time consuming and requires only a Kuntscher's nail and a guidewire which are easily available in the operating rooms.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747634","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.596464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.196096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0595559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Interlocking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlocking"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
