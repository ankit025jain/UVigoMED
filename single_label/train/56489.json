{"id":56489,"title":"Resolution of papilledema after endoscopic third ventriculostomy versus cerebrospinal fluid shunting in hydrocephalus: a comparative study.","abstract":"In this study the authors compare the efficacy of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) versus CSF shunting for resolution of papilledema in hydrocephalus.This comparative case series study recruited 12 patients (24 eyes) with hydrocephalus who underwent either an ETV (Group 1, 6 patients [12 eyes]) or CSF shunt treatment (Group 2, 6 patients [12 eyes]). A complete ophthalmological examination including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) evaluation by optical coherence tomography was provided for all patients before surgery and in the 1st week, 1st month, and 3rd month postoperatively. The 2 groups were compared for quantitative changes in RNFL thickness and, thereby, resolution of papilledema. Statistical evaluation was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test with the aid of SPSS version 16.0.The mean preoperative RNFL thickness was 259.7 ± 35.8 ?m in Group 1 and 244.5 ± 53.4 ?m in Group 2 (p = 0.798). The mean decrease in RNFL thickness was 101.3 ± 38.8 ?m, 141.2 ± 34.6 ?m, and 162.0 ± 35.9 ?m in Group 1 versus 97.0 ± 44.6 ?m, 143 ± 45.6 ?m, and 130.0 ± 59.8 ?m in Group 2 for the postoperative 1st week, 1st month, and 3rd month, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to decrease in RNFL thickness during the 1st week, 1st month, and 3rd month (p = 0.563, p = 0.753, and p = 0.528, respectively).This is the first study to quantitatively evaluate papilledema in assessing the success of ETV and CSF shunting. The authors' results indicated that ETV is as effective as CSF shunting with respect to decreasing intracranial pressure and resolution of papilledema.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678778","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Papilledema","weight":0.745103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilledema"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.718277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.594133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.472041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.32323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Ventriculostomy","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriculostomy"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.243798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.184501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.11378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.0589625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Nerve fiber layer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber_layer"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"753","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/753"},{"name":"798","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/798"},{"name":"244","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/244"},{"name":"259","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/259"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Estonian language","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language"},{"name":"Eesti Televisioon","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_Televisioon"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
