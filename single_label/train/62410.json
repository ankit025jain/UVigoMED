{"id":62410,"title":"[Novel uses of rituximab].","abstract":"Since its approved by HAS in 1998, the use of rituximab increases every year. Marketed in France under the name MabThera, rituximab is used primarily in the treatment of B-cell malignancies including follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and corresponding to the three main indications for treatment. However, given its action on B cells, rituximab also proves to be effective in rheumatoid arthritis. By extension as anti-B-cell, rituximab is actually used in other autoimmune diseases: in autoimmune cytopenias as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic anemia, in vasculitis, or multiple sclerosis, it is also used in organ transplantation as kidney in prophylaxy to rejection and treatment of EBV-mediated complications.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579323","annotations":[{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.861668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Hemolytic anemia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolytic_anemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.453812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"France","weight":0.348623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.322626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.282215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Cytopenia","weight":0.244191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopenia"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"}]}
