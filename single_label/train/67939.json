{"id":67939,"title":"An adsorbent monolith device to augment the removal of uraemic toxins during haemodialysis.","abstract":"Adsorbents designed with porosity which allows the removal of protein bound and high molecular weight uraemic toxins may improve the effectiveness of haemodialysis treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A nanoporous activated carbon monolith prototype designed for direct blood contact was first assessed for its capacity to remove albumin bound marker toxins indoxyl sulphate (IS), p-cresyl sulphate (p-CS) and high molecular weight cytokine interleukin-6 in spiked healthy donor studies. Haemodialysis patient blood samples were then used to measure the presence of these markers in pre- and post-dialysis blood and their removal by adsorbent recirculation of post-dialysis blood samples. Nanopores (20-100 nm) were necessary for marker uraemic toxin removal during in vitro studies. Limited removal of IS and p-CS occurred during haemodialysis, whereas almost complete removal occurred following perfusion through the carbon monoliths suggesting a key role for such adsorbent therapies in CKD patient care.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573455","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Activated carbon","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_carbon"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.814061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.761359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.698359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.653936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.600094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.496142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.495925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.340541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Plasma protein binding","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_protein_binding"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
