{"id":85308,"title":"FEV1 inversely correlates with metalloproteinases 1, 7, 9 and CRP in COPD by biomass smoke exposure.","abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. The aim of the present work was to determine plasma concentrations of MMPs and CRP in COPD associated to biomass combustion exposure (BE) and tobacco smoking (TS).Pulmonary function tests, plasma levels of MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-9/TIMP-1 and CRP were measured in COPD associated to BE (n?=?40) and TS (n =40) patients, and healthy non-smoking (NS) healthy women (controls, n?=?40).Plasma levels of MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-9, and MMP-9/TIMP-1 and CRP were higher in BE and TS than in the NS healthy women (p <0.01). An inverse correlation between MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-9/TIMP-1 and CRP plasma concentrations and FEV1 was observed.Increase of MMPs and CRP plasma concentrations in BE suggests a systemic inflammatory phenomenon similar to that observed in COPD associated to tobacco smoking, which may also play a role in COPD pathogenesis.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24980707","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.755792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.60354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.559801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.522274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.430764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.38029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.352428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Biomass","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.332313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Lung function test","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_function_test"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.185702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.107246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"MMP1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP1"},{"name":"MMP7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP7"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0215009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"British English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"The Matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix"},{"name":"Multi-Man Publishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Man_Publishing"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
