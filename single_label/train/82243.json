{"id":82243,"title":"FASN expression, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in central and peripheral giant cell lesions.","abstract":"Central giant cell lesion (CGCL) and peripheral giant cell lesion (PGCL) are non-neoplastic proliferative processes of the jaws. PGCL is a reactive process induced by irritant local factors and CGCL is an intra-osseous lesion of unknown etiology. Both lesions exhibit similar histologic features showing abundant mononuclear cells, admixed with a large number of multinucleated giant cells and a rich vascularized stroma with extravasated erythrocytes, hemosiderin deposition, and blood-filled pools. Recent studies have linked fatty acid synthase (FASN) with angiogenesis.To evaluate angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and their relationship with FASN expression in CGCL and PGCL.Thirteen CGCL and 14 PGCL of the jaws were selected for immunoexpression of FASN; CD34 and CD105 (to assess blood microvessel density [MVD] and microvessel area [MVA]); and D2-40 (to assess lymphatic MVD and MVA).Within PGCL and CGCL, MVD-CD34 was signifcantly higher than MVD-CD10S, followed by MVD-D2-40. Moreover, a signifcantly higher number of FASN-positive multinucleated giant cells than mononuclear cells were observed. Between PGCL and CGCL, only MVD-CD34 and all MVA were signifcantly higher in PGCL. Positive correlation between MVA-CD10S with FASNpositive mononuclear cells in both lesions was observed.Our results show both lesions exhibiting similar levels of FASN expression and neoangiogenesis, suggesting constitutive processes that regulate tissue maintenance.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676584","annotations":[{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Hemosiderin","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemosiderin"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.825521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.723987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.663739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.557844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.51766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Lymphangiogenesis","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphangiogenesis"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.401066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.317779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.221893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.208383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.176834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Endoglin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoglin"},{"name":"Fatty acid synthase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_synthase"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"}]}
