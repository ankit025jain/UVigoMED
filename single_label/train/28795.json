{"id":28795,"title":"Takotsubo's syndrome after mitral valve repair and rescue with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","abstract":"We report a case of Takotsubo's syndrome in a 37-year-old woman after mitral valve repair for severe mitral regurgitation triggered by a severe protamine reactionÂ that was likely associated with immune-mediated coronary hypersensitivity (Kounis' syndrome) and made worse by resuscitation with high doses of catecholamines. The patient recovered fully after a 4-day course of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (ECMO).
