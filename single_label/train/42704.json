{"id":42704,"title":"[Gastrointestinal features in systemic sclerosis].","abstract":"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare disorder associating vasculopathy, tissue fibrosis and autoimmunity. The gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) is frequently involved with any segment being potentially affected from mouth to anus. The esophagus is the most common localization resulting in reflux and its complications such as erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus. Gastric involvement is less frequent but may be complicated by hemorrhage due to gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE or watermelon stomach). Intestinal involvement may lead to malabsorption, intestinal pseudo-obstruction or bacterial overgrowth. Anorectal involvement can cause fecal incontinence and rectal prolapse. GIT involvement greatly affects morbimortality in SSc and therapeutic approaches essentially aim at relieving the symptoms.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834644","annotations":[{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Rectal prolapse","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal_prolapse"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.865408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malabsorption","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabsorption"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_bowel_bacterial_overgrowth_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.632873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.493297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.416327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gastric antral vascular ectasia","weight":0.41326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_antral_vascular_ectasia"},{"name":"Intestinal pseudoobstruction","weight":0.382244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_pseudoobstruction"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.179322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Systemic scleroderma","weight":0.110635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_scleroderma"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Watermelon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"}]}
