{"id":68959,"title":"[An adult case of acute pericarditis and glomerulonephritis associated with human parvovirus B19 infection].","abstract":"We report herein on a 52-year-old Japanese woman with acute pericarditis and glomerulonephritis associated with human parvovirus B19 infection, who had no significant medical history. The patient was admitted for progressive edema and upper abdominal pain. On physical examination, she had hypertension, generalized edema and upper abdominal tenderness. Urinalysis revealed protein (1+), and occult blood (+/-), with cellular casts. Echocardiography revealed pericardial effusion measuring 3-9mm in diameter. A serological test showed elevation of serum IgM antibodies for parvovirus B19. At the end of two weeks, generalized edema and glomerulonephritis improved spontaneously, and pericardial effusion was resolved three weeks after admission. This case would appear to be a very rare case indicating a direct relationship between human parvovirus B19 infection and acute pericarditis in a healthy adult patient.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483023","annotations":[{"name":"Pericarditis","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericarditis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glomerulonephritis","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Urinalysis","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinalysis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.731362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.716905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.594972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.533031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Parvovirus","weight":0.53031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvovirus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pericardial effusion","weight":0.495693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardial_effusion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Parvovirus B19","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvovirus_B19"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.0770068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Urinary cast","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_cast"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Tenderness (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderness_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
