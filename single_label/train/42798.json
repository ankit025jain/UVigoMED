{"id":42798,"title":"Pain and self-care behaviours in adult patients with end-stage liver disease: a longitudinal description.","abstract":"This prospective descriptive study investigated pain characteristics in 20 outpatients with endstage liver disease (ESLD) who were approaching the end of life, described variability in pain between and within patients, and described the pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain management strategies used. The instruments we utilized were the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the self-care behaviour (SCB) log for pain. Data were collected once a month over a six-month period. BPI severity of, and interference from pain mean scores ranged from 5.52 to 6.03 and 5.36 to 6.64, respectively. The top three pain-relieving behaviours reported by patients were \"taking pain medication,\" \"taking a nap,\" and \"asking for help.\" Pain medication intake-differed between patients who were pursuing a liver transplant and those who were not eligible for one. If we are to effectively improve care for ESLD patients, it is essential that we understand the ways in which these patients experience pain and the pain management strategies they employ.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826441","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.56127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.103663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"British Phonographic Industry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Phonographic_Industry"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Belgian general election, 2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_general_election,_2010"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"}]}
