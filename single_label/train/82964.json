{"id":82964,"title":"Salivary duct carcinoma of the parotid gland: is adjuvant HER-2-targeted therapy required?","abstract":"Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) of the parotid gland is a highly aggressive and uncommon tumor. Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) is characteristic of SDC. HER-2 overexpression is considered a poor prognostic marker for SDC, and anti-HER-2 therapy has been suggested as a therapeutic option.Two patients with SDC were analyzed for HER-2 overexpression and gene amplification using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization.In 1 patient, no expression of HER-2 was found. In the other patient, HER-2 was demonstrated. The patient with HER-2 overexpression had a worse prognosis, and trastuzumab proved to be an effective treatment.The present results have also suggested that HER-2 overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, HER-2 status should be evaluated at least in the presence of advanced SDC, and targeted therapy should be considered in the adjuvant setting.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480767","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.829067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.810553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.600941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.497777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.140264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"}]}
