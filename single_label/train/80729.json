{"id":80729,"title":"Significance of dermatoscopy in genital dermatoses.","abstract":"Dermatoscopy as a non-invasive technique has become an integrative part in the evaluation of pigmented and non-pigmented skin lesions, particularly for the early detections of melanoma. Although dermatoscopy improves diagnosis of pigmented and nonpigmented lesions of the skin, it is unknown if dermatoscopy improves the diagnostic accuracy of pigmented mucosal lesions. The \"entodermatoscopy\" is used for the dermatoscopy of skin infections and infestations and revised as entomodermatoscopy, as it connects the research fields of dermatology and entomology, with its roots being found in these two words. In genital dermatology along with the clinical examination, dermatoscopy is also used for the diagnosis and treatment follow-up of pediculosis pubis, genital warts, molluscum contagiosum, and scabies.
