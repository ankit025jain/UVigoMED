{"id":44307,"title":"Temporary protective loop ileostomy in open low rectal resection -- an alternative technique.","abstract":"The paper presents a simplified method for performing a temporary protective loop ileostomy as a result of our experience in 33 cases of low rectal resections for cancer.The particularities of this technique are: the skin incision is smaller than the muscle one, the seromuscular layer of the loop is fixed at the skin level only by marking a small portion of the antimesenteric wall, with no mucosal eversion. No supporting rod is used. The reversal requires resection of the thickened freemargins and enterorrhaphy. It involves a direct approach and avoids median laparotomy and segmental bowel resection.There was no case of peristomal abscess, bleeding, prolapse,retraction of the loop after the stoma was formed. Four patients(12.12%) had peristomal dermatitis. Five patients (15.62%) had high output fluid losses with electrolyte disorders, one of them(3.12%) with acute renal failure. Closure was performed after 6 weeks on average for the colorectal anastomoses and 10 weeks for the coloanal ones. We recorded a case (3.12%) of enterocutaneous fistula that was managed conservatively and 4 cases(12.12%) of incisional hernia, all of them surgically treated. No mortality was attributed to either creation or closure of the temporary loop ileostomy. It is a simple and fast technique in accordance with the temporary character of its indication.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742418","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Ileostomy","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileostomy"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Stoma","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.775346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Bowel resection","weight":0.665614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_resection"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.341111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.317461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.201457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"}]}
