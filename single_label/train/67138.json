{"id":67138,"title":"The epidemiology of human papillomaviruses.","abstract":"Epidemiological studies indicate that most men and women will acquire a sexually transmitted anogenital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in their lifetimes. In addition, infection with cutaneous HPV types is essentially ubiquitous. Most HPV infections are transient with no clinical symptoms although a minority of infections result in clinical disease such as warts or malignancies. Anogenital warts are the most common clinical manifestation of HPV infection with a prevalence of perhaps 1%. Virtually 100% of cervical cancers, 90-93% of anal canal cancers, 12-63% of oropharyngeal cancers, 36-40% of penile cancers, 40-64% of vaginal cancers and 40-51% of vulvar cancers are attributable to HPV infection. Of the estimated 12.7 million cancers occurring globally in 2008, 610,000 (approx. 5%) were HPV-associated anogenital or oral cancers. Cutaneous HPV types may increase the risk for nonmelanoma skin cancers. Sexual behavior is a primary risk factor associated with anogenital and oral HPV infection among men and women.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643179","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Genital wart","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genital_wart"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Vulvar cancer","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulvar_cancer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.727534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.667881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.566255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Wart","weight":0.493124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wart"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.383986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer","weight":0.268384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV-positive_oropharyngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Anal canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_canal"}]}
