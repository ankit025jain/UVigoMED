{"id":36730,"title":"Efficacy of paracetamol for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates.","abstract":"Inhibitors of the cyclo-oxygenase component of prostaglandin-H2 synthetase, namely indomethacin and ibuprofen, are commonly used in the treatment of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus. These drugs are associated with serious adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforation, renal failure and bleeding. The role of paracetamol, an inhibitor of the peroxidase component of prostaglandin-H2 synthetase, has been proposed for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus. We report a series of 8 neonates (birth weight: 724?±?173 g; gestational age: 26?±?2 weeks) treated with paracetamol for a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, because of contraindications to ibuprofen or indomethacin. Successful closure was achieved in 6 out of 8 babies (75%). Median ductal diameter was significantly reduced after treatment (from 1.2 mm, range 1.0-2.5 mm to 0.6 mm, range 0.0-2.5 mm, p?=?0.038). No adverse or side effects were observed during treatment. On the basis of these results, paracetamol could be considered a promising and safe therapy for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in neonates.
