{"id":20838,"title":"Systematic review of systemic treatments for tinea versicolor and evidence-based dosing regimen recommendations.","abstract":"Extensive or recurrent tinea versicolor (TV) can be treated with systemic antifungal therapies, but no dosing regimens have been approved for this indication.To provide evidence-based recommendations for dosing regimens.A systematic literature search was performed to identify trials reporting mycologic cure. All trials were included and assessed for quality. Correlation and statistical analyses were used to evaluate the effects of different dosing regimen parameters on efficacy.Fifty-seven trials investigating itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and pramiconazole were included. Cumulative dose, treatment duration, and daily/weekly concentrations were shown to significantly influence mycologic cure rates for ketoconazole and pramiconazole but not for itraconazole and fluconazole.Based on the efficacy evidence and potential safety concerns, this review supports the following dosing regimens: 200 mg/d for 5 or 7 days of itraconazole, 300 mg/wk for 2 weeks of fluconazole, and 200 mg/d for 2 days of pramiconazole.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636433","annotations":[{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.544955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.52053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.460921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Ketoconazole","weight":0.357341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoconazole"},{"name":"Cumulative dose","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_dose"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Itraconazole","weight":0.286689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itraconazole"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.286689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.143262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tinea versicolor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea_versicolor"},{"name":"Tinea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea"},{"name":"Mycology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Moru language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moru_language"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
