{"id":61031,"title":"Excimer laser in the treatment of mycosis fungoides.","abstract":"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which typically presents as a patch or plaque in early-stage disease. Phototherapy including psoralen plus ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B are well-established treatment modalities in management of early-stage MF. Only a limited number of reports have evaluated the efficacy of 308-nm excimer laser in therapy of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.We sought to evaluate the efficacy of 308-nm excimer laser (XTRAC, PhotoMedex, Montgomeryville, PA) in patients with stage IA to IIA MF.We reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 6 consecutive patients given the diagnosis of refractory MF who underwent treatment with excimer laser.We found that the 308-nm excimer laser is a safe and well-tolerated alternative therapy for early-stage MF. In addition, we were able to delineate criteria to help predict treatment response. Our data showed that 4 (66%) patients achieved clinical improvement (3 complete responses, 1 partial response), 1 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease.This was a retrospective study consisting of 6 patients. A prospective study with a larger sample size would be desirable for future studies.The use of 308-nm excimer laser in the treatment of stage IA to IIA MF showed clinical and pathological benefit for patients with isolated lesions or lesions in areas that may be difficult to treat because of anatomic location.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24775402","annotations":[{"name":"Mycosis fungoides","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis_fungoides"},{"name":"Psoralen","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoralen"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.815717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.709756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.619134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.570335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.364373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.308715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.113079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Excimer","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
