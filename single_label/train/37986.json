{"id":37986,"title":"A minimally invasive technique for occluding large muscular ventricular septal defects in infants.","abstract":"This study investigated the feasibility, timing and indications for closure of large muscular ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants without use of a cardiopulmonary bypass.A total of 9 infants with large muscular VSDs ranging in size from 7 to 15 mm were treated by minimally invasive closure without cardiopulmonary bypass between April 2010 and February 2013.All surgeries were successful without resulting in uncontrolled systemic infection, a pulmonary hypertensive crisis or a severely low cardiac output, and with an apparently shorter operation time and postoperative tracheal cannula.VSD closure without cardiopulmonary bypass can improve the efficacy and prognosis of infants with large muscular VSDs and concurrent pulmonary infections or respiratory failure.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457938","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Hypertensive emergency","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertensive_emergency"},{"name":"Cardiac output","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_output"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.623998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.432053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.403393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.295538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"}]}
