{"id":85301,"title":"Macitentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.","abstract":"Macitentan is a novel, dual endothelin receptor antagonist recently approved for the treatment of WHO Group I pulmonary arterial hypertension. Its pharmacologic mechanism of action as well as the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and potential drug-drug interactions have been demonstrated in multiple phase I and II trials. The pivotal randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven clinical trial revealed a significant reduction in morbidity. The most common adverse events were rarely clinically significant, nor did they result in a high rate of discontinuation. Of note, macitentan is contraindicated in pregnant women due to embryo-fetal toxicity.
