{"id":61959,"title":"Prognostic value of deep sequencing method for minimal residual disease detection in multiple myeloma.","abstract":"We assessed the prognostic value of minimal residual disease (MRD) detection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients using a sequencing-based platform in bone marrow samples from 133 MM patients in at least very good partial response (VGPR) after front-line therapy. Deep sequencing was carried out in patients in whom a high-frequency myeloma clone was identified and MRD was assessed using the IGH-VDJH, IGH-DJH, and IGK assays. The results were contrasted with those of multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) and allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR). The applicability of deep sequencing was 91%. Concordance between sequencing and MFC and ASO-PCR was 83% and 85%, respectively. Patients who were MRD(-) by sequencing had a significantly longer time to tumor progression (TTP) (median 80 vs 31 months; P < .0001) and overall survival (median not reached vs 81 months; P = .02), compared with patients who were MRD(+). When stratifying patients by different levels of MRD, the respective TTP medians were: MRD ?10(-3) 27 months, MRD 10(-3) to 10(-5) 48 months, and MRD <10(-5) 80 months (P = .003 to .0001). Ninety-two percent of VGPR patients were MRD(+). In complete response patients, the TTP remained significantly longer for MRD(-) compared with MRD(+) patients (131 vs 35 months; P = .0009).
