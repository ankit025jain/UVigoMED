{"id":82685,"title":"Cyclooxygenase-2 expression is associated with vascular endothelial growth factor-c and lymph node metastasis in human oral tongue cancer.","abstract":"This study aimed to determine the relationship of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-c (VEGF-C) expression with lymphangiogenesis, lymph node metastasis (LNM), and other clinicopathologic features in human oral tongue cancers.Forty tongue cancer specimens were immunohistochemically examined for COX-2 and VEGF-C expression and for lymphatic vessel density (LVD). We analyzed the relationships between COX-2 and VEGF-C expression and the relationships of such expression with clinicopathologic findings and survival of patients.Eighteen tumors out of 40 (45%) showed COX-2 expression, and 18 tumors (45%) expressed VEGF-C. Twelve tumors (30%) coexpressed COX-2/VEGF-C. A significant correlation was found between COX-2 and VEGF-C expression (P < .01). Of note, COX-2/VEGF-C coexpression significantly correlated with lymphangiogenesis, LNM, TNM stage (P < .01), and LVD (P < .05). In Cox regression for survival, COX-2/VEGF-C coexpression was identified as an independent prognostic factor (P < .05).Our results suggest that examination of immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 and VEGF-C predicts LNM and survival in human oral tongue cancers.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560404","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lymphatic vessel","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_vessel"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.794772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.720697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.718887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.609118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.596014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.426206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.373195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.35769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor C","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_C"},{"name":"Lymphangiogenesis","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphangiogenesis"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
