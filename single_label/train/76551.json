{"id":76551,"title":"Lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide metabolites, and their ratio in a group of subjects with metabolic syndrome.","abstract":"Our aim was to evaluate lipid peroxidation, expressed as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), nitric oxide metabolites (nitrite + nitrate) expressed as NOx, and TBARS/NOx ratio in a group of subjects with metabolic syndrome (MS). In this regard we enrolled 106 subjects with MS defined according to the IDF criteria, subsequently subdivided into diabetic (DMS) and nondiabetic (NDMS) and also into subjects with a low triglycerides/HDL-cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) index or with a high TG/HDL-C index. In the entire group and in the four subgroups of MS subjects we found an increase in TBARS and NOx levels and a decrease in TBARS/NOx ratio in comparison with normal controls. Regarding all these parameters no statistical difference between DMS and NDMS was evident, but a significant increase in NOx was present in subjects with a high TG/HDL-C index in comparison with those with a low index. In MS subjects we also found a negative correlation between TBARS/NO x ratio and TG/HDL-C index. Considering the hyperactivity of the inducible NO synthase in MS, these data confirm the altered redox and inflammatory status that characterizes the MS and suggest a link between lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and insulin resistance, evaluated as TG/HDL-C index.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24987495","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.898293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Nitrite","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.761744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.745098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Nitrate","weight":0.600373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.545403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.432482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.330397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.143036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"NOx","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Dimethyl sulfide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfide"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
