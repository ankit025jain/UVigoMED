{"id":22149,"title":"Subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy home.","abstract":"Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SClg) replacement therapy is a new clinical service development in adult respiratory care undertaken at the Royal Brompton and Harefield Foundation Trust. SCIg therapy reduces appropriate patients' susceptibility to recurrent acute and chronic respiratory infections. Patients with specific chronic respiratory conditions and antibody deficiency can be treated with SCIg therapy at home, rather than with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy in hospital. Using a personalised teaching programme and managing the daily demands of the clinical service promotes greater concordance with treatment. With over 34% of our immunoglobulin therapy patients now on SCIg replacement therapy, this treatment innovation has brought about high levels of patient satisfaction and cost savings to trust budgets.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568017","annotations":[{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.702154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.623286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Harefield","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harefield"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"NHS foundation trust","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_foundation_trust"},{"name":"Personalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization"},{"name":"Royal Brompton Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Brompton_Hospital"},{"name":"Respiratory care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_care"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Trust law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law"},{"name":"Budget","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget"},{"name":"Trust (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
