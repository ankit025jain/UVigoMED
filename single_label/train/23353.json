{"id":23353,"title":"[The problem of Clostridium dlfficile infection in children with inflammatory bowel disease].","abstract":"The last decade has seen a significant increase in the incidence of diseases related to infection by Clostridium difficile (Clostridium difficile-associated disease--CDAD) in the U.S.A., Canada and European countries, which is probably due to the widespread environmental hipervirulent C. difficile strain NAP 1 / BI / 027. Those particularly affected by CDAD are patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who observed more severe infections, prolonged hospital stay, higher risk of complications and higher mortality. C. difficile infection can cause or mimic the symptoms of exacerbation of IBD. For this reason, all patients with exacerbations of IBD in the differential diagnosis should be considered a C. difficile infection. Patients with IBD often found non-antibiotic treatment of CDAD or previous hospitalisations. Young people with IBD are also more likely to get CDAD. It is necessary to conduct further studies in patients of the adult population and children with IBD in order to not only determine the effect of CDI on the course of inflammatory bowel disease, but also to determine the epidemiology, risk factors, and the most effective treatments for these patients.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490471","annotations":[{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.904407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.741734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.689984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.290249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.111608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0151828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"}]}
