{"id":81103,"title":"Limited genetic diversity and purifying selection in Iranian Plasmodium falciparum Generative Cell Specific 1 (PfGCS1), a potential target for transmission-blocking vaccine.","abstract":"Among vaccines, those that have an impact on transmission are in priority for malaria elimination and eradication. One of the new identified transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) candidate antigens is Generative Cell Specific 1 (GCS1) located on the male gametocytes of Plasmodium species. Since the antigenic diversity could hamper vaccine development, it is essential to determine the gene diversity of gcs1 in global malaria-endemic areas in order to develop efficient TBVs. Therefore, in this study, nucleotide diversity and selection in the Plasmodium falciparum GCS1 (PfGCS1) antigen were analyzed in 36 Iranian clinical isolates by using PCR sequencing in order to provide useful information on this TBV candidate antigen. For this purpose, successful sequence analysis was carried out in 36 isolates. The results showed three single-nucleotide polymorphisms including one synonymous (G1475A) and two non-synonymous (A697G and G1479A) mutations leading to 3 distinct haplotypes with different frequencies: GCS1-A (N184/D445, 16.7%), GCS1-B (S184/D445, 63.9%), and GCS1-C (N184/N445, 19.4%). The overall nucleotide diversity (?) for all 36 sequences of Iranian pfgcs1 was 0.00066Â±0.00012, and the dN-dS value (-0.00028) was negative, suggesting the possible action of purifying selection in this gene. Epitope mapping prediction of PfGCS1 antigen showed that most of the potential linear and conformational B-cell epitopes are located in conserved regions. However, N184S and D445N mutations were also involved in linear and conformational B-cell epitopes, respectively that should be considered in vaccine design. In conclusion, the present study showed a very low genetic diversity of pfgcs1 gene among Iranian isolates. Considering PfGCS1 as a conserved TBV candidate, our data provides valuable information to develop a PfGCS1-based TBV.
