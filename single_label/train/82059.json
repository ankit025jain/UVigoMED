{"id":82059,"title":"Prevalence and distribution of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and its cdtB gene in subgingival plaque of Chinese periodontitis patients.","abstract":"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.actinomycetemcomitans) is an important periodontal pathogen that can participate in periodontitis and other non-oral infections. The cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) is among the virulence factors produced by this bacterium. This study was to elucidate the distribution of A.actinomycetemcomitans and the prevalence of its cdtB gene in Chinese subjects.A total of 255 subgingival samples were obtained from 30 subjects. Samples were collected from periodontal healthy sites as well as shallow, moderate and deep pockets. The absolute quantity of A.actinomycetemcomitans and cdtB gene were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.A.actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 92 of 105 (87.6%) samples of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) patients, in 73 of 79 (92.4%) samples of chronic periodontitis ( CP) patients and in 5 of 71 (7.0%) samples of periodontal healthy subjects. The cdtB gene was detected in 72 sites (78.3%) with AgP infected with A.actinomycetemcomitans, 54 sites (74.0%) with CP infected with A.actinomycetemcomitans and none in healthy sites infected with A.actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, quantity of A.actinomycetemcomitans and cdt gene in samples from deep pockets were significant larger than moderate, shallow and healthy sites (P?<?0.05). In comparison to CP, AgP patients were infected with increased numbers of cdt genotype in deep pockets (P?<?0.05).This study suggests that the cdtB gene are prevalent in A.actinomycetemcomitans, and the distribution of cdt genotype strain may be correlated with AgP and serious periodontal inflammation.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725913","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.790139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.731062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.650122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregatibacter_actinomycetemcomitans"},{"name":"Chronic periodontitis","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.349998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.233634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Periodontal pathogen","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_pathogen"},{"name":"255","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Military history of China before 1911","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_China_before_1911"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Deep pocket","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_pocket"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
