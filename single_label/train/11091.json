{"id":11091,"title":"Validation and comparison of different end point and real time RT-PCR assays for detection and genotyping of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.","abstract":"The accuracy and rapid diagnosis of PRRSV infection is a major prerequisite for every control and/or eradication strategy. In this study two real time RT-PCR based on different chemistry analysis (TaqMan Probes and SYBR Green) have been developed and validated before comparison to an end point two-step RT-PCR validated previously. All assays were aimed at discrimination between PRRSV genotypes. Furthermore, an exogenous internal control (IC) system had also been implemented in qRT-PCR. A rigorous analytical validation, executed on infected cell cultures and serum, demonstrated good sensitivity, specificity and repeatability. In particular RT-PCR was exceptionally sensitive and could detect a viral titre in the order of a magnitude of 1 copies/?L, 10-fold lower than other qRT-PCR described in this study. Optimal diagnostic performances have been demonstrated analyzing samples retrieved from an experimental infection, with RT-PCR again outperforming real time RT-PCR assays. All tests, showing substantial agreement between them, were able to detect early stages of viraemia (1 DPI) and some animals were classified as positive until the end of the study (76 DPI). Therefore, this supports the assays usefulness in animals with different clinical conditions and in a broad range of epidemiological scenarios. The benefits and disadvantages of different assays were also considered and discussed.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613148","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.622718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.5439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.393249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.374405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.216124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.196653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Computer security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
