{"id":29870,"title":"Using latent class analysis to identify participant typologies in a drug treatment court.","abstract":"Drug treatment courts serve a diverse population of adults. While all have engaged in criminal activities and have substance abuse problems, participants vary in the intensity of their problems as well as related concerns in other domains of functioning which also may require intervention. The purpose of this study was to identify differences among participants, which could have implications for the effectiveness of drug treatment courts.Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups from a sample of over 1000 adults attending two drug treatment courts in central California. Indicators measuring substance abuse, motivation for treatment, mental health concerns, education, employment, medical concerns, social supports, and demographic characteristics were obtained from the Addiction Severity Index while measures of prior criminal activity and treatment outcomes were obtained from probation; all were entered into the LCA.The LCA yielded three groups, which were labeled a Psychological Problems group, an Early Delinquent group, and a Subthreshold Need group. Significant differences in graduation and recidivism rates were found across these groups, with the Early Delinquent group demonstrating the poorest outcomes.This study provides evidence that there are significant differences among subgroups of drug treatment court participants. Implications for alternate treatment approaches based on participant characteristics are discussed.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598121","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.55626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.549112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.521643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.494809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Court","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"California","weight":0.375618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.346949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.313936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.288519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.212894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Juvenile delinquency","weight":0.212595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency"},{"name":"Recidivism","weight":0.195456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Graduation","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation"},{"name":"Probation","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
