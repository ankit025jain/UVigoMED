{"id":18030,"title":"In vitro activity of telavancin compared with vancomycin and linezolid against Gram-positive organisms isolated from cancer patients.","abstract":"Telavancin is a dual action, bactericidal lipoglycopeptide. Its in vitro activity was compared with vancomycin and linezolid against 392 Gram-positive isolates from cancer patients. MIC90 values (?g ml(-1)) for telavancin, vancomycin and linezolid were determined for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible (MS), methicillin-resistant (MR), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), viridans group streptococci (VGS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus species, Corynebacterium species and Micrococcus species. Telavancin had potent activity against ?-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Whereas 100% of MRSA and 98% of MSSA had vancomycin MICs ? 1.0 ?g ml(-1) (minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at which poor clinical responses have been reported), the highest telavancin MIC was 0.38 ?g ml(-1). For CoNS, 95% of MS and 100% of MR isolates had vancomycin MICs ? 1.0 ?g ml(-1), whereas the highest telavancin MIC was 0.38 ?g ml(-1). Furthermore, 48% of VGS had vancomycin MICs ? 1.0 ?g ml(-1), whereas the highest telavancin MIC was 0.064 ?g ml(-1). A similar pattern was noticed for S. lugdunensis, Bacillus species, Corynebacterium species and ?-hemolytic streptococci. These data suggest that telavancin and linezolid have potent activity against most Gram-positive organisms that cause infections in cancer patients. Consequently, they may be considered as alternatives to vancomycin, especially in institutions wherein a substantial proportion of infections are caused by organisms with vancomycin MICs ? 1.0 ?g ml(-1).","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824818","annotations":[{"name":"Glycopeptide antibiotic","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycopeptide_antibiotic"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Linezolid","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linezolid"},{"name":"Telavancin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telavancin"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.830998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Corynebacterium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corynebacterium"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.575313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.46009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Streptococcus viridans","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_viridans"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Micrococcus","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrococcus"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.153973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Millilitre","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millilitre"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
