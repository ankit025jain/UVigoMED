{"id":28467,"title":"Testing for drugs of abuse in children and adolescents.","abstract":"Drug testing is often used as part of an assessment for substance use in children and adolescents. However, the indications for drug testing and guidance on how to use this procedure effectively are not clear. The complexity and invasiveness of the procedure and limitations to the information derived from drug testing all affect its utility. The objective of this clinical report is to provide guidance to pediatricians and other clinicians on the efficacy and efficient use of drug testing on the basis of a review of the nascent scientific literature, policy guidelines, and published clinical recommendations.","date":"2014-07-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864184","annotations":[{"name":"Drug","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.590766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.153015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"}]}
