{"id":18828,"title":"Fecal microbiota transplant for relapsing Clostridium difficile infection using a frozen inoculum from unrelated donors: a randomized, open-label, controlled pilot study.","abstract":"Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with poor response to standard antimicrobial therapy is a growing medical concern. We aimed to investigate the outcomes of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for relapsing CDI using a frozen suspension from unrelated donors, comparing colonoscopic and nasogastric tube (NGT) administration.Healthy volunteer donors were screened and a frozen fecal suspension was generated. Patients with relapsing/refractory CDI were randomized to receive an infusion of donor stools by colonoscopy or NGT. The primary endpoint was clinical resolution of diarrhea without relapse after 8 weeks. The secondary endpoint was self-reported health score using standardized questionnaires.A total of 20 patients were enrolled, 10 in each treatment arm. Patients had a median of 4 (range, 2-16) relapses prior to study enrollment, with 5 (range, 3-15) antibiotic treatment failures. Resolution of diarrhea was achieved in 14 patients (70%) after a single FMT (8 of 10 in the colonoscopy group and 6 of 10 in the NGT group). Five patients were retreated, with 4 obtaining cure, resulting in an overall cure rate of 90%. Daily number of bowel movements changed from a median of 7 (interquartile range [IQR], 5-10) the day prior to FMT to 2 (IQR, 1-2) after the infusion. Self-ranked health score improved significantly, from a median of 4 (IQR, 2-6) before transplant to 8 (IQR, 5-9) after transplant. No serious or unexpected adverse events occurred.In our initial feasibility study, FMT using a frozen inoculum from unrelated donors is effective in treating relapsing CDI. NGT administration appears to be as effective as colonoscopic administration.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762631","annotations":[{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.84351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Nasogastric intubation","weight":0.809068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.562603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.323844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.239155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"}]}
