{"id":66891,"title":"Possible association of FAS and FASLG polymorphisms with the risk of idiopathic azoospermia in southeast Turkey.","abstract":"To investigate the association of the genetic variants of FAS/FASLG cell death pathway genes in male infertility, we genotyped the FAS -670A/G, -1377G/A, and FASLG -124A/G single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 108 infertile men with idiopathic azoospermia and in 125 proven fertile controls. The distribution of genotypes and alleles for SNPs at FAS -1377G/A and FASLG -124A/G loci were determined not to be statistically different between the case and control groups. However, the genotype frequencies of SNPs, FAS -670AA and FAS -670AG, were found to be significantly different between the case and control groups. Whereas the FAS -670AA genotype might be regarded as a higher predisposition for idiopathic azoospermia, FAS -670AG could be interpreted to mean that this genotype provides protection against idiopathic azoospermia. The study of combined genotype and haplotype frequencies has found statistically significant differences between case and control subjects for some combinations. The AA-GG binary genotype for the FAS670 and FAS1377 loci couple, in particular, may have a high degree of predisposition to idiopathic azoospermia. Our results suggest that FAS -670A/G SNP may be a genetic predisposing factor of idiopathic azoospermia among southeastern Anatolian men. Larger studies are needed to verify these findings. Furthermore, our data indicated a possible linkage between the FAS and FASLG genes and idiopathic azoospermia.
