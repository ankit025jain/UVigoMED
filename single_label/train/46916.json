{"id":46916,"title":"Advances in IBD genetics.","abstract":"IBD is a spectrum of chronic disorders that constitute an important health problem worldwide. The hunt for genetic determinants of disease onset and course has culminated in the Immunochip project, which has identified >160 loci containing IBD susceptibility genes. In this Review, we highlight how genetic association studies have informed our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD by focusing research efforts on key pathways involved in innate immunity, autophagy, lymphocyte differentiation and chemotaxis. Several of these novel genetic markers and cellular pathways are promising candidates for patient stratification and therapeutic targeting.
