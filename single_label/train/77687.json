{"id":77687,"title":"[Predictors of osteoarticular problems in a cohort of computer users in Lebanon: about 810 employees].","abstract":"The aim of the study is the analysis of osteoarticular problems (OAP) occurring in a group of computer users (CU) in search of correlation between symptoms and different etiological factors.Questionnaire of 31 items dealing with personal data, the activity of the CU, stress, the occurrence of osteoarticular problems during the last month (Oaplm) and last twelve months (Oaptm) and a checklist of 17 items covering the physical characteristics of the workplace.DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS * 810 respondents of mean age 36 +/- 9 years and predominantly female (69%) *seniority at the workplace (12.5 +/- 9 years), pace of work (825 +/- 1.5 hours/day and 5.5 +/- 1 days/ week), number of breaks (13 +/- 1.04/d), duration of breaks (35 min +/- 25/d), 44.5% in sports activities, work stress in 92% of participants * OAP described:--Osteoarticular problems last month (62%), neck pain (68%), shoulder (46%) and lumbar spine (62%) pain. Tingling hands (40%). Headache (55.5%). Temporomandibular disorders (18.5%)--Osteoarticular problems the last twelve months (46%). UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS: Detection of risk factors * RISK FACTORS and Oaplm relationship: female, weight gain, secretary, stress, pain during labor and work stoppages withp < 0.05 * RISK FACTORS and Oaptm relationship: the position of secretary, stress, pain at work, work stop-pages for Oaplm withp < 0.05 * Protection factor: sports more than one time per week. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS: Oaplm occurrent factors: weight gain, Oaptm withp < 0.05. Protection factor: well designed workstation * Oaptm occurrent factors: age, stress and Oaplm with p < 0.05.Significant prevalence of osteoarticular problems in Lebanese computer users.age, Oaptm, weight gain, stress, work-break cycle not respected and poor layout of the workstation. Ergonomic interventions are necessary and indispensable to reduce the cost of occupational diseases related to the CU, and ensure good mental and physical health.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24422367","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.748311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.574413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lebanon","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.397409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.393319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.26538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Occupational disease","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_disease"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.120719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0972833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"Neck pain","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Strike action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action"},{"name":"Secretary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary"},{"name":"Cuba","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Tingling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tingling"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
