{"id":38165,"title":"Cardiac right-to-left shunt subtypes in Chinese patients with cryptogenic strokes: a multicenter case-control study.","abstract":"Data on the possible association between cardiac right-to-left shunt (RLS) and cryptogenic stroke are lacking in Asians. RLS and its subtypes in Chinese cryptogenic stroke patients were investigated.Patients (n = 153, mean age 42 ± 10 years, 81 male) with cryptogenic stroke from four medical centers in China and 135 healthy volunteers (mean age 34 ± 8 years, 54 male) were recruited. Contrast transcranial Doppler was used to assess the prevalence of RLS. A three-level RLS categorization was applied as follows: none, 0 microbubbles (MBs); small, 1-25 MBs; and large, >25 MBs. RLS was considered latent if it occurred only after the Valsalva maneuver or permanent when it occurred also during normal respiration.Overall, RLS (P = 0.02), large RLS (P < 0.001) and permanent RLS (P = 0.02) were more frequently detected in patients with cryptogenic stroke than in healthy volunteers. The prevalences of small RLS and latent RLS in the two groups were similar (22% vs. 21% and 11% vs. 10%, respectively). The proportion of large RLSs amongst the subjects with RLS was much higher in the patient group than in healthy volunteers (45% vs. 18%, P < 0.001), whilst the proportion of permanent RLS was similar (72% vs. 64%, P = 0.11). Most large RLSs in the patient group (22/27, 81%) were permanent RLSs.Cardiac RLS is associated with cryptogenic stroke in Chinese. However, the higher prevalence of overall RLS in the patient group was mainly due to the increased proportion of large RLSs. The results only support large RLSs as a pathological condition.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444328","annotations":[{"name":"Heart","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.744206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"China","weight":0.572382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Respiration (physiology)","weight":0.466892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Valsalva maneuver","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"},{"name":"Transcranial doppler","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_doppler"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Latent heat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Radiocontrast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocontrast"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cryptogenic","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogenic"},{"name":"Microbubbles","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbubbles"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
