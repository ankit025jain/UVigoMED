{"id":53332,"title":"The association between food prices and the blood glucose level of US adults with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"We estimated the association between the price of healthy and less-healthy food groups and blood sugar among US adults with type 2 diabetes.We linked 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey health information to food prices contained in the Quarterly Food-at-Home Price Database. We regressed blood sugar levels on food prices from the previous calendar quarter, controlling for market region and a range of other covariates. We also examined whether the association between food prices and blood sugar varies among different income groups.The prices of produce and low-fat dairy foods were associated with blood sugar levels of people with type 2 diabetes. Specifically, higher prices for produce and low-fat dairy foods were associated with higher levels of glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose 3 months later. Food prices had a greater association with blood sugar for low-income people than for higher-income people, and in the expected direction.Higher prices of healthy foods were associated with increased blood sugar among people with type 2 diabetes. The association was especially pronounced among low-income people with type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524504","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dairy product","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.732756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Diet food","weight":0.531578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_food"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.134809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Sugars in wine","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugars_in_wine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Food group","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_group"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Calendar","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"American football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Price","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
