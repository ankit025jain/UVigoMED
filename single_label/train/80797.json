{"id":80797,"title":"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-[4-(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-piperazin-1-yl]-propionic acid hydrazones as antiprotozoal agents.","abstract":"N-Acylhydrazones derived from 7-chloro-4-piperazin-1-yl-quinoline were synthesized and biologically evaluated for blood-stage of Plasmodium falciparum and Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. N-Acylhydrazone F12 was found to inhibit the P. falciparum growth as well as its life cycle with good selectivity, which was achieved by inhibiting hematin formation. Compound F24 showed better IC50 value than the amoebicidal drug metronidazole.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530492","annotations":[{"name":"Acid","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.422041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.38428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Metronidazole","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronidazole"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.200597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Entamoeba histolytica","weight":0.196135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba_histolytica"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.118638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.10801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Hemin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemin"},{"name":"Amebicide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amebicide"},{"name":"Antiprotozoal agent","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiprotozoal_agent"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.0210801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Factor XII","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_XII"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Hydrazone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazone"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Entamoeba","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba"}]}
