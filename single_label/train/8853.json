{"id":8853,"title":"Incremental replacement of saturated fats by n-3 fatty acids in high-fat, high-cholesterol diets reduces elevated plasma lipid levels and arterial lipoprotein lipase, macrophages and atherosclerosis in LDLR-/- mice.","abstract":"Effects of progressive substitution of dietary n-3 fatty acids (FA) for saturated FA (SAT) on modulating risk factors for atherosclerosis have not been fully defined. Our previous reports demonstrate that SAT increased, but n-3 FA decreased, arterial lipoprotein lipase (LpL) levels and arterial LDL-cholesterol deposition early in atherogenesis. We now questioned whether incremental increases in dietary n-3 FA can counteract SAT-induced pro-atherogenic effects in atherosclerosis-prone LDL-receptor knockout (LDLR-/-) mice and have identified contributing mechanisms.Mice were fed chow or high-fat diets enriched in SAT, n-3, or a combination of both SAT and n-3 in ratios of 3:1 (S:n-3 3:1) or 1:1 (S:n-3 1:1). Each diet resulted in the expected changes in fatty acid composition in blood and aorta for each feeding group. SAT-fed mice became hyperlipidemic. By contrast, n-3 inclusion decreased plasma lipid levels, especially cholesterol. Arterial LpL and macrophage levels were increased over 2-fold in SAT-fed mice but these were decreased with incremental replacement with n-3 FA. n-3 FA partial inclusion markedly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory markers (CD68, IL-6, and VCAM-1) in aorta. SAT diets accelerated advanced atherosclerotic lesion development, whereas all n-3 FA-containing diets markedly slowed atherosclerotic progression.Mechanisms whereby dietary n-3 FA may improve adverse cardiovascular effects of high-SAT, high-fat diets include improving plasma lipid profiles, increasing amounts of n-3 FA in plasma and the arterial wall. Even low levels of replacement of SAT by n-3 FA effectively reduce arterial lipid deposition by decreasing aortic LpL, macrophages and pro-inflammatory markers.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747115","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Lipoprotein lipase","weight":0.885779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein_lipase"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"LDL receptor","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDL_receptor"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.811833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Lipase","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"VCAM-1","weight":0.774588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCAM-1"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.59774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.562814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.405245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.30913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.219913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"CD68","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD68"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
