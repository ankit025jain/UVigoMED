{"id":86828,"title":"[A problem of the HIV drug resistance].","abstract":"The wide use of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) of HIV infection leads to the HIV drug resistance. The simultaneous formation of the resistance to different groups of antiviral drugs compromises the efficacy of HAART. Thus, the problem of the drug resistance becomes of an enormous significance. In this review, a definition of the resistance is given; the problem of the drug-resistant strains transmission is discussed; the assays used for resistance testing are described; recommendations for the antiviral drug-resistance testing are given.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549461","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.617797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.603461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.575313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.342541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"}]}
