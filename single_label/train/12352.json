{"id":12352,"title":"Mechanism of the histamine H(3) receptor-mediated increase in exploratory locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviours in mice.","abstract":"Histaminergic neurons are activated by histamine H(3) receptor (H(3)R) antagonists, increasing histamine and other neurotransmitters in the brain. The prototype H(3)R antagonist thioperamide increases locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviours; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to determine the mechanism underlying H(3)R-mediated behavioural changes using a specific H(3)R antagonist, JNJ-10181457 (JNJ). First, we examined the effect of JNJ injection to mice on the concentrations of brain monoamines and their metabolites. JNJ exclusively increased N(?)-methylhistamine, the metabolite of brain histamine used as an indicator of histamine release, suggesting that JNJ dominantly stimulates the release of histamine release but not of other monoamines. Next, we examined the mechanism underlying JNJ-induced behavioural changes using open-field tests and elevated zero maze tests. JNJ-induced increase in locomotor activity was inhibited by ?-fluoromethyl histidine, an inhibitor of histamine synthesis, supporting that H(3)R exerted its effect through histamine neurotransmission. The JNJ-induced increase in locomotor activity in wild-type mice was preserved in H(1)R gene knockout mice but not in histamine H2 receptor (H(2)R) gene knockout mice. JNJ-induced anxiety-like behaviours were partially reduced by diphenhydramine, an H(1)R antagonist, and dominantly by zolantidine, an H(2)R antagonist. These results suggest that H(3)R blockade induces histamine release, activates H(2)R and elicits exploratory locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviours.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530460","annotations":[{"name":"Histamine receptor","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_receptor"},{"name":"Diphenhydramine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine"},{"name":"Neurotransmission","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmission"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Histidine","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histidine"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.798868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Monoamine neurotransmitter","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.611728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.59483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.525444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.473598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.448417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.4219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Histamine H3 receptor","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_H3_receptor"},{"name":"Histamine H2 receptor","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_H2_receptor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.115375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Thioperamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thioperamide"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"}]}
