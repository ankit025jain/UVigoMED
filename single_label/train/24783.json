{"id":24783,"title":"Quantification of low-gradient severe aortic stenosis using a hybrid approach combining Doppler echocardiography and thermodilution.","abstract":"Estimation of stroke volume in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is a main limitation to aortic valve area (AVA) calculation by echocardiography when using the continuity equation. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that a hybrid method using thermodilution-derived cardiac output measurement and simultaneous Doppler estimation of the systolic ejection period and transvalvular aortic velocities could be used to accurately assess AVA in patients with low-gradient severe aortic stenosis (AS).Eighteen patients with low mean gradient (< 40 mmHg) and nine patients with conventionally defined (> or = 40 mmHg) severe AS (< 1 cm2), as assessed by the echocardiographic continuity equation (baseline echocardiography), underwent catheterization and simultaneous Doppler recording of trans-aortic velocities.The mean pressure gradient was slightly lower by Doppler in the catheterization laboratory (35.8 +/-15.7 mmHg) compared to baseline echocardiography (37.4 +/- 15.2 mmHg) and invasive (38.5 +/- 16.6 mmHg) measurements (both p < 0.05). The AVA values were 0.72 +/- 0.12 cm2 during baseline echocardiography, 0.74 +/- 0.14 cm2 by catheterization, and 0.71 +/- 0.14 cm2 by the hybrid method (bias -0.01 +/- 0.11 cm2 and -0.02 +/- 0.08 cm2, versus echocardiography and catheterization, respectively; both p = NS).The hybrid method is reasonably accurate in assessing AVA in patients with low-gradient severe AS. Although the continuity equation should be used in routine clinical practice in most patients, this method could serve as an alternative when the LVOT diameter and/or velocities seem questionable.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296448","annotations":[{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Cardiac output","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_output"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Stroke volume","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_volume"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aortic valve stenosis","weight":0.723499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_stenosis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.687773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.635632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.536687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.472082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.375594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.370446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.283118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.238516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Continuity equation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation"},{"name":"Doppler echocardiography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_echocardiography"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Calculation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation"},{"name":"Ventricular outflow tract","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_outflow_tract"}]}
