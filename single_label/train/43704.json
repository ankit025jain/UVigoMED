{"id":43704,"title":"[Value of adhesion molecules for evaluating the efficiency of therapy for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease].","abstract":"To define the value of adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1 integrin, P-selectin, E-selectin, and L-selectin) for the prediction and evaluation of the efficiency of treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease.Twenty-six patients with UC and 14 patients with CD were examined. Of them, 16 patients took infliximab (INF) in a dose of 5 mg/kg of body weight according to the standard scheme; 14 patients received cultured mesenchymal stem stromal cells (MSSCs) in a quantity of 150 x 10(8) cells, and 10 had azathioprine (AZA) 2 mg/kg and glucocorticosteroids (GCS) 1 mg/kg of body weight. Enzyme immunoassay was used to determine the serum concentration of the adhesion molecules (L-selectin, E-selectin, P-selectin, and sVCAM-1 integrin) before and 2 months after treatment.The signs of bowel inflammatory disease activity and the elevated levels of adhesion molecules whose synthesis did not occur under normal conditions remained in the patients receiving GCS and AZA. INF treatment caused a decrease in P-selectin, E-selectin, and sVCAM-1 levels to 8.9 +/- 1.0, 5.5 +/- 1.7, and 9.5 +/- 4.4 ng/ml, respectively (p < 0.001). Incorporation of MSSCs was followed by a reduction of the concentrations of P-selectin and E-selectin to 6.9 +/- 1.1 and 5.7 +/- 1.3 ng/ml, respectively (p < 0.001). The level of integrin (cVCAM-1) fell to 12.2 +/- 2.2 ng/ml (p > 0.1); that of L-selectin did not drop after MSSC administration and INF induction therapy.P-selectin, E-selectin, L-selectin, and sVCAM-1 integrin are current inflammatory markers and may be used to evaluate the efficiency of standard and biological therapies for inflammatory bowel diseases and to predict disease course.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772505","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Infliximab","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infliximab"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Azathioprine","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.742385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.571178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.508439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.440647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.414979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.397951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.260377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Standard conditions for temperature and pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
