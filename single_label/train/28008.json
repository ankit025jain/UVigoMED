{"id":28008,"title":"Psychometric properties of the Turkish versions of the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) and the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) in the prison setting.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate psychometric properties of the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) and the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) in prisoners with (n = 124) or without (n = 78) drug use disorder. Participants were evaluated with the DUDIT, the DAST-10, and the Addiction Profile Index-Short (API-S). The DUDIT and the DAST-10 were found to be psychometrically sound drug abuse screening measures with high convergent validity when compared with each other (r = 0.86), and API-S (r = 0.88 and r = 0.84, respectively), and to have a Cronbach's ? of 0.93 and 0.87, respectively. In addition, a single component accounted for 58.28% of total variance for DUDIT, whereas this was 47.10% for DAST-10. The DUDIT had sensitivity and specificity scores of 0.95 and 0.79, respectively, when using the optimal cut-off score of 10, whereas these scores were 0.88 and 0.74 for the DAST-10 when using the optimal cut-off score of 4. Additionally, both the DUDIT and the DAST-10 showed good discriminant validity as they differentiated prisoners with drug use disorder from those without. Findings support the Turkish versions of both the DUDIT and the DAST-10 as reliable and valid drug abuse screening instruments that measure unidimensional constructs.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052790","annotations":[{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.761977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Discriminant validity","weight":0.740104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant_validity"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.69129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.619339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.358217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prison","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.233549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Discriminant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant"},{"name":"Convergent validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_validity"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Diethylaminosulfur trifluoride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylaminosulfur_trifluoride"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cutscore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscore"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
