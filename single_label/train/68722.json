{"id":68722,"title":"Successful treatment of recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with a low dose rituximab in a kidney transplant recipient.","abstract":"Recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a major therapeutic challenge in kidney transplantation (KT). Although intensive plasmapheresis and high-dose rituximab have been introduced to treat recurrent FSGS, the most effective dosage and regimen of rituximab have not been determined. Herein we reported the first case of successful treatment of recurrent FSGS with a low-dose rituximab. The patient showed marked proteinuria (3.5 g/d) and oliguria 2 d after KT. Two courses of plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin were applied to the patient, however, nephrotic range proteinuria persisted and creatinine level increased to 3.56 mg/dL. Five months post-transplant, the patient received injection with only one dose of rituximab 100 mg, without further plasmapheresis, which resulted in immediate reduction of serum creatinine and full remission of proteinuria during the following 18 months. This case suggested that recurrent FSGS, which frequently relapses after plasmapheresis, could be treated successfully with a low-dose rituximab even without plasmapheresis.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502587","annotations":[{"name":"Oliguria","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliguria"},{"name":"Plasmapheresis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis"},{"name":"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.699598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.38613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.327891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.171955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0331975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Order of the Thistle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Thistle"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"}]}
