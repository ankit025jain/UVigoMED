{"id":30525,"title":"MicroRNAs as potential biomarkers in diseases and toxicology.","abstract":"MiRNAs (microRNAs) are single-stranded non-coding RNAs of approximately 21-23 nucleotides in length whose main function is to inhibit gene expression by interfering with mRNA processes. MicroRNAs suppress gene expression by affecting mRNA (messenger RNAs) stability, targeting the mRNA for degradation, or both. In this review, we have examined how microRNA expression could be altered following exposure to chemicals and how they could represent appropriate tissue and more interestingly circulating biomarkers. Among the key questions before using the microRNA for evaluation of risk toxicity, it remains still to clarify how they could be causally involved in the adverse effects and how stable their changes are.
