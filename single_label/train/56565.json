{"id":56565,"title":"Neuroprotective effects of low level electrical stimulation therapy on retinal degeneration.","abstract":"Low-level electrical stimulation applied to the eye has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells. In this review, we compare the effects of Subretinal Electrical Stimulation (SES), Transcorneal Electrical Stimulation (TES), and Whole Eye Stimulation (WES) on preserving retinal structure and function, and visual acuity, in retinal degeneration. Similarities and differences in stimulus parameters, targeted cells and growth factor expression will be discussed with emphasis on studies that have translated laboratory findings into clinical trials.
