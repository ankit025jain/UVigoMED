{"id":26408,"title":"Comparison of five-year outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting versus percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with left ventricular ejection fractions?50% versus >50% (from the CREDO-Kyoto PCI/CABG Registry Cohort-2).","abstract":"Coronary heart disease is a major risk factor for left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. However, limited data are available regarding long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the era of drug-eluting stent or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with LV systolic dysfunction with severe coronary artery disease. We identified 3,584 patients with 3-vessel and/or left main disease of 15,939 patients undergoing first myocardial revascularization enrolled in the CREDO-Kyoto PCI/CABG Registry Cohort-2. Of them, 2,676 patients had preserved LV systolic function, defined as an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of >50% and 908 had impaired LV systolic function (LVEF?50%). In patients with preserved LV function, 5-year outcomes were not different between PCI and CABG regarding propensity score-adjusted risk of all-cause and cardiac deaths. In contrast, in patients with impaired LV systolic function, the risks of all-cause and cardiac deaths after PCI were significantly greater than those after CABG (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.14, p=0.03 and hazard ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 3.98, p<0.01). In both patients with moderate (35%<LVEF?50%) and severe (LVEF?35%) LV systolic dysfunction, the risk of cardiac death after PCI was significantly greater than that after CABG (hazard ratio 2.25, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 4.40, p=0.02 and hazard ratio 4.42, 95% confidence interval 1.48 to 13.24, p=0.01). Similarly, the risk of all-cause death tended to be greater after PCI than after CABG in both patients with moderate and severe LV systolic dysfunction without significant interaction (hazard ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 2.56, p=0.07 and hazard ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 2.82, p=0.32; interaction p=0.91). CABG was associated with better 5-year survival outcomes than PCI in patients with impaired LV systolic function (LVEF?50%) with complex coronary disease in the era of drug-eluting stents. In both patients with moderate (35%<LVEF?50%) and severe (LVEF?35%) LV systolic dysfunction, CABG tended to have better survival outcomes than PCI.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25124184","annotations":[{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.832981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.641265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.588503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Systolic dysfunction","weight":0.50751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_dysfunction"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.185174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
