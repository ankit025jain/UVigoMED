{"id":62543,"title":"Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma and simultaneous marginal zone lymphoma of the skin: a case report.","abstract":"Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the skin is a rare malignant epithelial neoplasm, which shows histological resemblance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Schmincke-Regaud tumor). Similar tumors have been reported at a variety of sites, including salivary gland, tonsil, thymus, stomach, and uterus. Extracutaneous LELC shows frequently an association with Epstein-Barr virus, whereas Epstein-Barr virus in LELC of the skin has been described only once till now. LELC of the skin usually presents as a papulonodular lesion on the head or neck of patients above 50 years of age. Here, we describe a collision tumor with an LELC and a marginal zone lymphoma of the skin in a 75-year-old female patient. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an association between these 2 malignancies, and the possibility of a causal relationship is discussed.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556903","annotations":[{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Tonsil","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsil"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharyngeal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Marginal zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_zone"},{"name":"Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_zone_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"}]}
