{"id":86837,"title":"Gain-of-function experiments: time for a real debate.","abstract":"According to the WHO, dual use research of concern (DURC) is \"life sciences research that is intended for benefit, but which might easily be misapplied to do harm\". Recent studies, particularly those on influenza viruses, have led to renewed attention on DURC, as there is an ongoing debate over whether the benefits of gain-of-function (GOF) experiments that result in an increase in the transmission and/or pathogenicity of potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs) are outweighed by concerns over biosecurity and biosafety. In this Viewpoint article, proponents and opponents of GOF experiments discuss the benefits and risks associated with these studies, as well as the implications of the current debate for the scientific community and the general public, and suggest how the current discussion should move forward.
