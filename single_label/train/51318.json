{"id":51318,"title":"What is the optimal treatment for obese patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma?","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare primary debulking surgery (PDS) vs neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval debulking surgery (NACT-IDS) among obese patients.Medical records of patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ?30 kg/m(2) with ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal carcinoma between January 2005 and December 2010 were reviewed. Patients were separated by PDS or NACT-IDS. Preoperative characteristics, surgical procedures, and postoperative and oncologic outcomes were compared.Of 117 patients, 95 women (81.2%) underwent PDS, and 22 women (18.8%) underwent NACT-IDS. Patients who underwent NACT-IDS were more likely to have stage IV disease (63.6% vs 26.3%; P = .001) and a low surgical complexity score (n = 14; 63.6%). There were no other differences between groups with respect to preoperative characteristics or postoperative morbidity. Compared with the NACT-IDS group, the PDS group had an improved progression-free survival (PFS; 15 vs 11 months; P = .006) and overall survival (OS; 53 vs 32 months; P = .036). Seventy-eight patients (66.7%) had a BMI of 30-34.9 kg/m(2). Within this subset of obese patients, the PDS group had an improved PFS (15 vs 10 months; P = .011) and OS (58 vs 32 months; P = .033), compared with the NACT-IDS group. Among patients with a BMI of ?35 kg/m(2), there was no difference in PFS (14 vs 12 months; P = .316) or OS (38 vs 32 months; P = .640) when the PDS and NACT-IDS groups were compared.Patients with a BMI of 30-34.9 kg/m(2) who undergo PDS have improved oncologic outcomes, compared with those women who undergo NACT-IDS. Patients with a BMI of ?35 kg/m(2) who undergo PDS have similar oncologic outcomes to those who undergo NACT-IDS. Complication rates were similar at all BMIs, regardless of treatment approach.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704062","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.767901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.611683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.597526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.585517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.147104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"640","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/640"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
