{"id":13022,"title":"Anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of Wrightia arborea.","abstract":"Anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of methanolic extract of Wrightia arborea (MEWA) were examined using different models in rats. MEWA was given to rats orally upto 2000 mg kg(-1) b.wt. for acute toxicity study and observed for 14 days. Anti-nociceptive activity was evaluated in rats against Acetic acid induced writhing (chemically induced pain) and Tail immersion method (thermally induced pain). Acute anti-inflammatory activity of MEWA was also evaluated in Formaline-induced rat paw edema model and Carrageenan-induced hind paw edema model in rats. Results demonstrated that no mortality was found upto single dose of 2000 mg kg(-1) b.wt. in rats even after 14 days observation. In comparison to control group MEWA at 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) b.wt. showed highly significant anti-nociceptive activity against chemically (p < 0.001) as well as thermally (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001) induced pain as compared to standard drugs, indomethacin and nalbufin, respectively. In the formalin test, both the doses of 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) of extract significantly prevented increase in volume of paw edema (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) both in the neurogenic and inflammatory phases. MEWA (200 and 400 mg kg(-1) p.o.) also significantly prevented increase in volume of paw edema in Carrageenan test (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001). The results suggest that MEWA has significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory potential which may be mediated by central and peripheral mechanism.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498815","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.869218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.477849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.469795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.468345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.363573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Carrageenan","weight":0.135726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan"},{"name":"Indometacin","weight":0.130812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"}]}
