{"id":67942,"title":"MicroRNA-10b promotes migration and invasion through KLF4 and HOXD10 in human bladder cancer.","abstract":"The present study was performed to investigate the effect of microRNA-10b (miR-10b) on cell migration and invasion in human bladder cancer (BC). Real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression of miR-10b in BC cell lines. miR-10b mimics, the negative control for mimics, miR-10b inhibitor and the negative control for inhibitor were transfected into BC cell lines and the effects of miR-10b on the migration and invasion of cells were investigated through Transwell assay. Meanwhile, protein levels of KLF4, HOXD10, E-cadherin and MMP14 were measured. Luciferase assays were also performed to validate KLF4 and HOXD10 as miR-10b targets. In vivo metastasis assay was performed to validate if miR-10b can promote BC cell line metastasis in vivo. miR-10b is significantly upregulated in BC cell lines and metastatic tissues. Increased miR-10b expression significantly enhanced BC cell migration and invasion, while decreased miR-10b expression reduced cell migration and invasion. In vivo metastasis assay demonstrated that overexpression of miR-10b markedly promoted BC metastasis. Moreover, KLF4 and HOXD10 were identified as direct targets of miR-10b in BC cells. Silencing of KLF4 or HOXD10 recapitulated the pro-metastatic function. Furthermore, we found that E-cadherin and MMP14 may be the downstream factors of KLF4 and HOXD10 in the suppression of BC metastasis by miR-10b. These data suggest that miR-10b may function as oncogenes in BC cells. Targeting these novel strategies, inhibition of miR-10b/KLF4/E-cadherin axis and miR-10b/HOXD10/MMP14 axis may be helpful as a therapeutic approach to block BC cell metastasis.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573354","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.862549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.803296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.755917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.751748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.649368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.483971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.270936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Hox gene","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hox_gene"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"KLF4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLF4"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
