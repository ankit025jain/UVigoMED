{"id":20886,"title":"Development of a one-step PCR assay with nine primer pairs for the detection of five diarrheagenic Escherichia coli types.","abstract":"Certain Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains have the ability to cause diarrheal disease. Five types of diarrheagenic E. coli have been identified, including EHEC, ETEC, EPEC, EAEC, and EIEC. To detect these five diarrheagenic types rapidly, we developed a one-step multiplex PCR (MPPCR) assay using nine primer pairs to amplify nine virulence genes specific to the different virotypes, with each group being represented (i.e., stx1 and stx2 for EHEC, lt, sth, and stp for ETEC, eaeA and bfpA for EPEC, aggR for EAEC, and ipaH for EIEC). The PCR primers were constructed using MultAlin. The sensitivity and specificity of the constructed multiplex PCR primers were measured using DNA isolated from diarrheagenic E. coli strains representing each group. The limits of detection were as follows: 5 × 10(1) CFU/ml for EHEC, 5 × 10(3) CFU/ml for ETEC expressing lt and sth, 5 × 10(4) CFU/ml for ETEC expressing stp, 5 × 102 CFU/ml for EPEC, 5 × 10(4) CFU/ml for EAEC, and 5 × 10(2) CFU/ml for EIEC. To confirm the specificity, C. jejuni, C. perfringens, S. Typhimurium, V. parahaemolyticus, L. monocytogenes, Y. enterocolitica, B. cereus, and S. aureus were used as negative controls, and no amplification was obtained for these. Moreover, this kit was validated using 100 fecal samples from patients with diarrhea and 150 diarrheagenic E. coli strains isolated in Korea. In conclusion, the multiplex PCR assay developed in this study is very useful for the rapid and specific detection of five diarrheagenic E. coli types. This single-step assay will be useful as a rapid and economical method, as it reduces the cost and time required for the identification of diarrheagenic E. coli.
