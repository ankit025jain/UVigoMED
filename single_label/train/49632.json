{"id":49632,"title":"Total parathyroidectomy with trace amounts of parathyroid tissue autotransplantation as the treatment of choice for secondary hyperparathyroidism: a single-center experience.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to evaluate total parathyroidectomy with trace amounts of parathyroid tissue (30 mg) as a surgical option in secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) treatment.From January 2008 to March 2012, 47 patients underwent parathyroidectomy. Comparisons of demographic data, symptoms, and preoperative or postoperative biochemistry were made between total parathyroidectomy with trace amounts of parathyroid tissue autotransplantation group and total parathyroidectomy group.Out of 47 cases, 45 had successful operation. 187 parathyroid glands identified at the initial operation were reported in 47 patients. 43 patients had been diagnosed with parathyroid hyperplasia, and 4 patients had a benign adenoma. After operation, pruritus, bone pain and muscle weakness disappeared, also serum PTH and serum phosphate were declined markedly as well. After discharge, two patients (in total parathyroidectomy group) were readmitted because of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. Graft-dependent recurrence was not observed in an average follow-up of 42 months.Total parathyroidectomy with sternocleidomastoid muscle trace amounts of parathyroid tissue autotransplantation is considered to be a feasible, safe and effective surgical option for the patients with sHPT.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886230","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.881188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Hypoparathyroidism","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoparathyroidism"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.786694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.71301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.660539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sternocleidomastoid muscle","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternocleidomastoid_muscle"},{"name":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Bone pain","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_pain"},{"name":"Parathyroidectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroidectomy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
