{"id":53795,"title":"[Stress and pancreatic carcinoma--?-adrenergic signaling and tumor biology].","abstract":"In several carcinomas, ?-adrenergic signaling has been found to regulate relevant processes of cancer biology. Until recently, pancreatic cancer has not been in the focus of respective research. But in view of the incidence and poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer, new insights in biology and therapeutic strategies are of prime importance. Nowadays, several reports describe influences of the catecholaminergic system on pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo. Effects were shown on proliferation and apoptosis of carcinoma cells as well as on interactions with tumor-microenvironment and dissemination and metastasis formation. In contrast to other entities, evidence even suggests links between ?-adrenergic signaling and initiation of the disease. The following report summarizes the most relevant results demonstrating implications for further research and possible interventions.
