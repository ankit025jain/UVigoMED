{"id":44557,"title":"Can hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy efficiency be improved by blocking the DNA repair factor COP9 signalosome?","abstract":"A frequently used chemotherapeutic agent in hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is mitomycin C (MMC) which induces DNA damage and apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, MMC activates DNA damage response (DDR) leading to repair mechanisms counteracting the effect of chemotherapy. COP9 signalosome (CSN) positively influences the DDR pathway by its intrinsic deneddylating and associated kinase activities. In an in vitro HIPEC model, we studied the impact of curcumin, an inhibitor of CSN-associated kinases, and of the microRNA (miRNA) let-7a-1, an inhibitor of CSN subunit expression, on the MMC-induced apoptosis in human HT29 colon cancer cells.Cells were incubated at 37 °C and indicated concentrations of MMC in a medium preheated to 42 °C as under HIPEC conditions for 1 or 4 h. HT29 cells were cotreated with 50 ?M curcumin or transfected with let-7a-1 miRNA mimic. After incubation, cells were analyzed by Western blotting, densitometry, and caspase-3 ELISA.An increase of CSN subunits in response to MMC treatment was detected. Apoptosis was only measured after 4 h with 50 ?M MMC. MMC-induced apoptosis was elevated by cotreatment with curcumin. Transfection of HT29 cells with let-7a-1 reduced the expression of tested CSN subunits associated with the accumulation of the pro-apoptotic factors p27 and p53.In response to MMC treatment, the CSN is elevated as a regulator of DDR retarding apoptosis in tumor cells. The therapeutic effect of HIPEC can be increased by inhibiting CSN-associated kinases via curcumin or by blocking CSN expression with let-7a-1 miRNA.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728517","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.912617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Curcumin","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.862818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.741125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.671768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.601941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.596533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.518766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"CDKN1B","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN1B"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"East Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
