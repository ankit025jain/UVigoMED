{"id":81182,"title":"Upside-down mask ventilation technique for a patient with a long and narrow mandible.","abstract":"Mask ventilation, along with tracheal intubation, is one of the most basic skills for managing an airway during anesthesia. Facial anomalies are a common cause of difficult mask ventilation, although numerous other factors have been reported. The long and narrow mandible is a commonly encountered mandibular anomaly. In patients with a long and narrow mandible, the gaps between the corners of the mouth and the lower corners of the mask are likely to prevent an adequate seal and a gas leak may occur. When we administer general anesthesia for these patients, we sometimes try to seal the airway using several sizes and shapes of commercially available face masks. We have found that the management of the airway for patients with certain facial anomalies may be accomplished by attaching a mask upside down.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25517554","annotations":[{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.698359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.690355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.610403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.578148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.515767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.434709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.156765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Facial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Pinniped","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Try","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Try"},{"name":"Goaltender mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender_mask"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Basic skills","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_skills"},{"name":"Gas leak","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_leak"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"}]}
