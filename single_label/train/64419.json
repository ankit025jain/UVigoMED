{"id":64419,"title":"IL-9 is a key component of memory TH cell peanut-specific responses from children with peanut allergy.","abstract":"Differentiation between patients with peanut allergy (PA) and those with peanut sensitization (PS) who tolerate peanut but have peanut-specific IgE, positive skin prick test responses, or both represents a significant diagnostic difficulty. Previously, gene expression microarrays were successfully used to identify biomarkers and explore immune responses during PA immunotherapy.We aimed to characterize peanut-specific responses from patients with PA, subjects with PS, and atopic children without peanut allergy (NA children).A preliminary exploratory microarray investigation of gene expression in peanut-activated memory TH subsets from 3 children with PA and 3 NA children identified potential PA diagnostic biomarkers. Microarray findings were confirmed by using real-time quantitative PCR in 30 subjects (12 children with PA, 12 children with PS, and 6 NA children). Flow cytometry was used to identify the TH subsets involved.Among 12,257 differentially expressed genes, IL9 showed the greatest difference between children with PA and NA children (45.59-fold change, P < .001), followed by IL5 and then IL13. Notably, IL9 allowed the most accurate classification of children with PA and NA children by using a machine-learning approach with recursive feature elimination and the random forest algorithm. Skin- and gut-homing TH cells from donors with PA expressed similar TH2- and TH9-associated genes. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that IL9 was the highest differentially expressed gene between children with PA and NA children (23.3-fold change, P < .01) and children with PS (18.5-fold change, P < .05). Intracellular cytokine staining showed that IL-9 and the TH2-specific cytokine IL-5 are produced by distinct TH populations.In this study IL9 best differentiated between children with PA and children with PS (and atopic NA children). Mutually exclusive production of IL-9 and the TH2-specific cytokine IL-5 suggests that the IL-9-producing cells belong to the recently described TH9 subset.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112699","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.786943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.67345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.646976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.586326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Peanut","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.397521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.397458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.348417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Tyrosine hydroxylase","weight":0.229359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase"},{"name":"Peanut allergy","weight":0.223432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_allergy"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.157576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Forest","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
