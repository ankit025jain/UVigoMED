{"id":88831,"title":"Spinal cord injury pain.","abstract":"Chronic pain associated with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) can be quite challenging to the physiatrist. This highly prevalent condition within the SCI population requires an appropriate evaluative approach including a thorough history, a targeted physical examination, and appropriate use of diagnostic testing. The International Spinal Cord Injury Pain Classification allows for a reasonable categorization of the various pain syndromes and may assist in selecting a reasoned treatment strategy. A multitude of management approaches exist including nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and interventional approaches. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, evaluation, and management of SCI-associated pain.
