{"id":82434,"title":"Socioeconomic status, food security, and dental caries in US children: mediation analyses of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007-2008.","abstract":"We examined associations of household socioeconomic status (SES) and food security with children's oral health outcomes.We analyzed 2007 and 2008 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for children aged 5 to 17 years (n?=?2206) to examine the relationship between food security and untreated dental caries and to assess whether food security mediates the SES-caries relationship.About 20.1% of children had untreated caries. Most households had full food security (62%); 13% had marginal, 17% had low, and 8% had very low food security. Higher SES was associated with significantly lower caries prevalence (prevalence ratio [PR]?=?0.77; 95% confidence interval?=?0.63, 0.94; P?=?.01). Children from households with low or very low food security had significantly higher caries prevalence (PR?=?2.00 and PR?=?1.70, respectively) than did children living in fully food-secure households. Caries prevalence did not differ among children from fully and marginally food-secure households (P?=?.17). Food insecurity did not appear to mediate the SES-caries relationship.Interventions and policies to ensure food security may help address the US pediatric caries epidemic.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625141","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Food security","weight":0.483135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.474975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.450159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.290844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.25754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.152005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.14807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Security","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"National Health Service (England)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
