{"id":70140,"title":"Evaluation of anti-melanoma activities of (1S,2E,4R,6E,8R,11S,12R)-8,12-epoxy-2,6-cembradiene-4,11-diol, (1S,2E,4R,6E,8S,11R,12S)-8,11-epoxy-4,12-epoxy-2,6-cembradiene and (1S,4R,13S)-cembra-2E,7E,11E-trien-4,13-diol from the Red Sea soft coral Sarcophyto","abstract":"Three natural cembranoids from the Red Sea soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum namely (1S,2E,4R,6E,8R,11S,12R)-8,12-epoxy-2,6-cembradiene-4,11-diol, (1S,2E,4R,6E,8S,11R,12S)-8,11-epoxy-4,12-epoxy-2,6-cembradiene and (1S,4R,13S)-cembra-2E,7E,11E-trien-4,13-diol were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on mouse melanoma B16F10 cell growth. Results show that all the cembranoids strongly inhibit viability of melanoma cells particularly during 48 -72 hrs treatment and also inhibit de novo DNA synthesis and PARP activity and stimulate fragmentation of DNA. (1S,2E,4R,6E,8R,11S,12R)-8,12-epoxy-2,6-cembradiene-4,11-diol was not cytotoxic to monkey kidney CV-1 cells at the concentration that produces the anti-melanoma effects which indicates that this compound may be a good candidate for further development. (1S,2E,4R,6E,8S,11R,12S)-8,11-epoxy-4,12-epoxy-2,6-cembradiene and (1S,4R,13S)-cembra-2E,7E,11E-trien-4,13-diol were found to be cytotoxic to healthy cells.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233593","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.712613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.711753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.516328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.446084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.353709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Coral","weight":0.347254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.298937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.209583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Monkey","weight":0.205114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Red Sea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Alcyonacea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcyonacea"},{"name":"Epoxy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Toyota R engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_R_engine"},{"name":"Toyota E engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_E_engine"},{"name":"MT-RNR1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT-RNR1"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"}]}
