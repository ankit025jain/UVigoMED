{"id":50728,"title":"Is the masked continuous glucose monitoring system clinically useful for predicting hemoglobin A1C in type 1 diabetes?","abstract":"The masked continuous glucose monitoring system (Masked-CGMS) differs from standard CGMSs in three ways: (1) there is no feedback to the user so that no immediate regimen changes can be made; (2) it can only be worn for up to 5 days; and (3) there are no alarms to warn of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Since 2008 masked-CGMS has become popular for identifying reasons that a patient's hemoglobin A1C does not correlate closely with his or her capillary blood glucose measurements. To date only one study addressing the clinical utility of Masked-CGMS for improving A1C in diabetes has been published. No studies are available specifically examining the variability and correlation of Masked-CGMS and A1C.We performed 156 Masked-CGMS studies (40 patients studied sequentially a maximum of four times each) in type 1 diabetes patients. We then analyzed the resulting interstitial glucose levels obtained from the Masked-CGMS compared with an A1C measurement performed within 1 week of the Masked-CGMS study.There was a very low correlation between the A1C and the Masked-CGMS-derived mean interstitial glucose level. This statistic did not provide sufficiently predictive information to be clinically useful for changing an individual patient's intensive insulin therapy regimen.Our data demonstrate that a very weak correlation exists between 5 days of masked CGMS and a concurrently measured A1C level. For the individual type 1 diabetes patient, this relationship would unlikely to be clinically useful in altering the individual's treatment regimen.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758730","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Intensive insulinotherapy","weight":0.739338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_insulinotherapy"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.730687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.384706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.20861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Alarm devices","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_devices"},{"name":"Wrestling mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_mask"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Clinical utility of diagnostic tests","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_utility_of_diagnostic_tests"},{"name":"1C Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1C_Company"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
