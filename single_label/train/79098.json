{"id":79098,"title":"Cochlear implantation in Ménière's disease patients.","abstract":"A significant portion of the Ménière's disease (MD) population will ultimately have severe-to-profound hearing loss in their affected ear. When this occurs bilaterally or when a patient has poor hearing in the contralateral ear, these patients may meet criteria for cochlear implantation (CI). Here, we describe our institution's CI outcomes in MD patients.Retrospective chart and literature review.Tertiary referral center.Twenty-one patients with either bilateral MD or unilateral MD who underwent CI in their ear affected with MD.Cochlear implantation.Postoperative speech perception.Results for the MD patients were also compared with a standard sample of 178 adult recipients implanted with newest generation technology. Collapsing across status of MD activity, there was a significant difference between the MD CNC word recognition scores and that of the standard sample (43.2 versus 59.1%, p = 0.02). When separating the MD patients into groups according to the status of disease activity, those with active MD achieved scores that were not significantly different from the standard sample (55.7 versus 59.1%, p = 0.94), although those without active MD were significantly different from the standard group (38.2 versus, p = 0.002). Patients undergoing surgical or ablative procedures for their MD symptoms had statistically significant improvement in their CI hearing outcomes compared with those who did not (CNC words: p = 0.014; CNC phonemes: p = 0.035). Six patients had persistent vertiginous symptoms of MD before CI. After CI, 2 had complete resolution of vertigo, 3 had subjective improvement in their symptoms, and 1 noticed no change.Ménière's disease patients' hearing outcomes seem to be worse than the general CI population. However, those with active MD perform similarly to the general CI population.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492131","annotations":[{"name":"Perception","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.781217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.725667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.602871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.565075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Speech perception","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_perception"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Phoneme","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Numerical control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Word","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (energy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
