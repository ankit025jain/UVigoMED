{"id":52245,"title":"[Three-dimensional ultrasound locatization in endoscopic thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter].","abstract":"To explore the three-dimensional ultrasound locatization in endoscopic thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter (MG).Thirty two patients with MG underwent ET via bilateral areolar approach. Preoperative ultrasonography were used to locate lesions and marked in the 3-D map designed by us. Dur ing ET procedure, surgery skills were adopted to expose inferior pole of thyroid, glands in the area of Berry ligament or (and) upper pole were retained according to the preoperative location map.According to the preoperative ultrasonic orientation, 3 lobectomy were performed in 15 cases of unilateral lesions, 12 subtotal thyroidectomy were performed in 17 cases of bilateral lesions, and 5 patients performed unilateral lobectomy add partial thyroidectomy. All patients had successful ET using bilateral areola approach. No conversions to open surgery, no complication occurred, and no nodules were found missing in the postoperative ultrasonography examinations.Preoperative ultrasonic orientation and intraoperative operating skills are contributing to a successful ET for MG.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616986","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Areola","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areola"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.492908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.426127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"MG Cars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Loose connective tissue","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_connective_tissue"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
