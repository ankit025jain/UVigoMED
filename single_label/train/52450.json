{"id":52450,"title":"Modulatory role of D-chiro-inositol (DCI) on LH and insulin secretion in obese PCOS patients.","abstract":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition that affects fertility through oligo-ovulation, hyperandrogenism and polycystic morphology of the ovaries. Since it has been demonstrated a high incidence of insulin resistance in PCOS patients, our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the integrative treatment with D-chiro-inositol (DCI) (500?mg die, per os, for 12 weeks) on hormonal parameters and insulin sensitivity in a group of overweight/obese PCOS patients (body mass index; BMI?>?26). After the treatment, interval several endocrine parameters improved (luteinizing hormone [LH], LH/follicle stimulating hormone [FSH], androstenedione and insulin), insulin response to oral glucose tolerance test reported the significant improvement of insulin sensitivity as well as the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced (10?Âµg, in bolus) LH response. BMI decreased, though no lifestyle modification was requested. When data were analyzed according to the presence or absence of first-grade diabetic relatives, PCOS patients with diabetic relatives showed greater improvement after DCI administration. In conclusion DCI administration is effective in restoring better insulin sensitivity and an improved hormonal pattern in obese hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients, in particular, in hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients who have diabetic relatives.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601829","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Androstenedione","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androstenedione"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Hyperandrogenism","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperandrogenism"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.794933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.709329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.688431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.660471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.561188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.407807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.201356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Posttranslational modification","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Menstrual disorder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_disorder"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
