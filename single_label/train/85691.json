{"id":85691,"title":"Propofol prevents lung injury after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion by inhibiting the interaction between mast cell activation and oxidative stress.","abstract":"Both mast cells and oxidative stress are involved in acute lung injury (ALI) induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR). The aim of this study was to investigate whether propofol could improve IIR-induced ALI through inhibiting their interaction.Repetitive, brief IIR or IIR+compound 48/80 was performed in adult Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with saline, apocynin or propofol. And their lungs were excised for histology, ELISA and protein-expression measurements 2h after reperfusion.Rats pretreated with saline developed critical ALI 2h after IIR. We found significant elevations in lung injury scores, lung wet/dry ratio and gp91phox, p47phox, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 protein expressions and higher level of malondialdehyde, interleukin-6 contents, and myeloperoxidase activities, as well as significant reductions in superoxide dismutase activities, accompanied with increases in mast cell degranulation evidenced by significant increases in mast cell counts, ?-hexosaminidase concentrations, and tryptase expression. And the lung injury was aggravated in the presence of compound 48/80. However, pretreated with propofol and apocynin not only ameliorated the IIR-mediated pulmonary changes beyond the biochemical changes but also reversed the changes that were aggravated by compound 48/80.Propofol protects against IIR-mediated ALI, most likely by inhibiting the interaction between oxidative stress and mast cell degranulation.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878149","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Degranulation","weight":0.847389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degranulation"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.747562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.655606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.508863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.444711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.432797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.341542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.328168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.304835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.121984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Tryptase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptase"},{"name":"Acute lung injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lung_injury"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
