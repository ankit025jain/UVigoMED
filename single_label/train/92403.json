{"id":92403,"title":"Transcriptome-wide analysis of messenger RNA decay in normal and osteoarthritic human articular chondrocytes.","abstract":"Messenger RNA (mRNA) decay rates control not only gene expression levels, but also responsiveness to altered transcriptional input. We undertook this study to examine transcriptome-wide posttranscriptional regulation in both normal and osteoarthritic (OA) human articular chondrocytes.Human articular chondrocytes were isolated from normal or OA tissue. Equine articular chondrocytes were isolated from young or old horses at a commercial abattoir. RNA decay was measured across the transcriptome in human cells by microarray analysis following an actinomycin D chase. Messenger RNA levels in samples were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.Examination of total mRNA expression levels demonstrated significant differences in the expression of transcripts between normal and OA chondrocytes. Interestingly, almost no difference was observed in total mRNA expression between chondrocytes from intact OA cartilage and those from fibrillated OA cartilage. Decay analysis revealed a set of rapidly turned over transcripts associated with transcriptional control and programmed cell death that were common to all chondrocytes and contained binding sites for abundant cartilage microRNAs. Many transcripts exhibited altered mRNA half-lives in human OA chondrocytes compared to normal cells. Specific transcripts whose decay rates were altered were generally less stable in these pathologic cells. Examination of selected genes in chondrocytes from young and old healthy horses did not identify any change in mRNA turnover.This is the first investigation into the \"posttranscriptome\" of the chondrocyte. It identifies a set of short-lived chondrocyte mRNAs likely to be highly responsive to altered transcriptional input as well as mRNAs whose decay rates are affected in OA chondrocytes.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25155964","annotations":[{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Slaughterhouse","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.784194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.752616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.522422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.455173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.416381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Chondrocyte","weight":0.314393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.258263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.230791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.15896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.139755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Actinomycin","weight":0.110579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinomycin"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hunting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting"},{"name":"Equus (genus)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(genus)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"}]}
