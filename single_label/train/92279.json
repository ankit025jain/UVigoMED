{"id":92279,"title":"Prevention of aberrant protein aggregation by anchoring the molecular chaperone ?B-crystallin to the endoplasmic reticulum.","abstract":"The chaperone ?B-crystallin (?BC) is a member of the small heat shock protein family and its point or truncated mutants cause the muscular disorder ?-crystallinopathy. The illness is histologically characterized by accumulation of protein aggregates in muscle cells. Expression of the myopathy-causing R120G mutant of ?BC, harboring an arginine-to-glycine mutation at position 120, results in aggregate formation. We demonstrated that tethering ?BC to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane represses the protein aggregation mediated by the R120G mutant. ER-anchored ?BC decreased the amount of the R120G mutant through autophagic proteolysis. In contrast, knockdown of ATG5, an E3 ligase essential for autophagy, in ER-anchored ?BC-transfected cells restored the quantity of the R120G mutant. In this context, aggregate formation was still suppressed, indicating that ER-anchored ?BC profoundly constrains aggregation competency of the R120G mutant separately from downregulating the abundance of the mutant. We have proposed that protein aggregation is prevented by manipulation of the ER microenvironment with ?BC, and have shed light on a novel aspect of the ER as a therapeutic target.
