{"id":66843,"title":"[Update in current care guidelines: acute kidney injury].","abstract":"Acute Kidney Injury is an increasing problem. Prevention is based on early detection of risk patients, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications, and adequate fluid therapy with crystalloid solutions. Mortality does not differ between intermittent and continuous renal replacement therapy. Dose above 22 ml/kg/h does not decrease mortality.
