{"id":43486,"title":"[Clinical characteristics and prognosis of three rare and poor-prognostic subtypes of primary liver carcinoma].","abstract":"To explore the clinicopathological features and prognostic factors of three rare and poor-prognostic pathological subtypes of primary liver carcinoma, and improve the clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment.A retrospective analysis of clinicopathological data of 69 patients with rare pathological subtypes of primary liver carcinoma, diagnosed by postoperative pathology in our hospital from October 1998 to June 2013 was carried out. The data of 80 cases of common poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma treated in the same period were collected as control group. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the survival rate, and Cox proportional hazards model was used for prognostic analysis in the patients.Thirty-four cases were combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (CCC, 28 males, 6 females), with a median age of 52 years (range, 33 to 73). Ninteen cases were giant cell carcinoma (GCC, 16 males and 3 females), with a median age of 59 years (range, 38 to 66). Sixteen cases were sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC, 14 males and 2 females), with a median age of 57 years (range, 46 to 70). The survival analysis revealed that median survival time and the 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates for these 3 groups were 20 months, 61.8%, 29.4%, and 20.6% in the CCC patients, 13 months, 52.6%, 31.6%, and 0% in the GCC patients, and 8 months, 31.3%, 0%, 0% in the SC patients, respectively. The median survival time and survival rate of the SC group were significantly lower than those of the other three groups (P < 0.05). However, in the SC group, the incidences of hilar lymph nodes metastasis, vascular tumor emboli and invasion of adjacent organs were significantly higher than those in the other three groups (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences among the other three groups (P > 0.05). The levels of carcino-embryonic antigen were higher in the three rare subtype groups than that of the control group. The incidences of multiple tumors of the three rare subtype groups were higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Positive surgical margin was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor.The combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, giant cell carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma have a poor prognosis. Among them sarcomatoid carcinoma is the most malignant and poor prognostic one. Radical resection is recommended.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785282","annotations":[{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Sarcomatoid carcinoma","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcomatoid_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Surgical margin","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_margin"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.578986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.359972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hilum (anatomy)","weight":0.192237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.153608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.0470393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Gigantism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantism"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
