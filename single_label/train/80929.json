{"id":80929,"title":"PAMAM-Lys, a novel vaccine delivery vector, enhances the protective effects of the SjC23 DNA vaccine against Schistosoma japonicum infection.","abstract":"Schistosomiasis japonica remains a major public-health concern in China. Praziquantel-based chemotherapy effectively reduces both infections and intensity; however, it can not prevent re-infection. Furthermore, there is an increasing concern about praziquantel resistance following long-term repeated use of the drug in endemic areas. Therefore, development of a schistosomiasis vaccine, as a strategy to prevent and control schistosomiasis japonica, has been given high priority. The present study was conducted to develop PAMAM dendrimers as a novel vaccine delivery vector for a schistosomiasis japonica DNA vaccine and evaluate its ability to enhance protective effects against Schistosoma japonicum infection.Lysine was used to modify 4.0G PAMAM, and the modified product PAMAM-Lys was synthesized. PAMAM-Lys showed both high transfection and low cytotocity for gene delivery in vitro. DNA vaccines combined with PAMAM-Lys produced higher level of protection compare with naked DNA vaccines against S. japonicum infection in a mouse model. Futhermore,antibodies from mice immunized with PAMAM-Lys combined DNA vaccines were significantly higher than those of mice immunized with the naked DNA vaccines. The PAMAM-Lys vector elicited a predominantly IgG2a antibody response and a tremendously increase in the production of IL-2 and IFN-?.Lysine-modified PAMAM-Lys is an excellent vector. PAMAM-Lys may enhance the immunoreactivity of DNA vaccine and increase the protective effect of the SjC23 DNA vaccine against S. japonicum infection.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497955","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.761507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.737935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.737012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.724645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.673504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"DNA vaccination","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccination"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.538725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.52514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.480046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.285637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Dendrimer","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrimer"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Praziquantel","weight":0.112303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praziquantel"},{"name":"Naked DNA","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_DNA"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Gene delivery","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_delivery"}]}
