{"id":88225,"title":"[Anti-high mobility group box-1 antibody therapy for traumatic brain injury].","abstract":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major causes of death and aftereffects in young individuals worldwide; however, efficient therapies for TBI are lacking at present. High mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1), which is recognized as a representative of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), plays an important role in triggering inflammatory responses in many types of diseases. We presented the involvement of HMGB-1 in TBI and evaluated the ability of intravenously administered neutralizing anti-HMGB-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to attenuate brain injury. Anti-HMGB-1 mAb may provide a novel and effective therapy for TBI by protecting against blood brain barrier disruption and reducing the inflammatory responses induced by HMGB-1.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882644","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.871541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Blood-brain barrier","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.526785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.151515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibody therapy","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody_therapy"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.051322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Allopatric speciation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation"}]}
