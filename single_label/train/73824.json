{"id":73824,"title":"BRCA1/2 germline mutations and their clinical importance in Turkish breast cancer patients.","abstract":"BRCA1/BRCA2 genes were screened in 117 patients with breast cancer by sequencing. Fourteen percent of patients tested positive for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Four frame shift mutations, four pathogenic missense mutations, and 25 different sequence variations were detected. BRCA mutation positivity was significantly associated with Ki67 (p = .001). BRCA protein expressions were decreased in the patients harboring important mutations and polymorphisms (BRCA1;P508 stop, V1740G, Q1182R, Q1756P and BRCA2;V2466A) related with disease. Our findings contribute significantly to the types of germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations and their biological effects in Turkish women. These data could help guide the management of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-carrying patients when considering breast-conserving therapy.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884828","annotations":[{"name":"BRCA1","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1"},{"name":"BRCA2","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA2"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.711178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Frameshift mutation","weight":0.567881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameshift_mutation"},{"name":"BRCA mutation","weight":0.288889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA_mutation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.155323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.120445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
