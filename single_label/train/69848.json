{"id":69848,"title":"Features related to breast cancer in an entire Argentine rural population.","abstract":"A descriptive study was developed in an entire Argentine rural community considering breast cancer risk factors, preventive strategies and breast cancer incidence.the study comprised of 83 women. A questionnaire of 34 items was employed; a mammogram and a breast ultrasound were performed. ANOVA and Pearson correlation were employed.Mean age was 54.5 years; 69% of women were postmenopausal; 96% had children; breastfeeding was X=10 months/child; Body Mass Index (BMI) was X=27.8 kg/m(2); 13% had first-degree relatives with breast cancer; 90% of women considered mammographic screening a necessary study. One woman had presented breast cancer. Argentine screening guidelines were not followed and an inverse relationship between education level and age of first mammogram was found (p<0.05). Mammographic and ultrasound studies did not reveal potential abnormalities.Peculiar social and cultural characteristics may be relevant to evaluate breast cancer risk factors in Argentina.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275052","annotations":[{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.710292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.689097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.610865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.378363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.357578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.288519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.28613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.233641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.156268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.0861073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Karl Pearson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Community (Armenia)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(Armenia)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
