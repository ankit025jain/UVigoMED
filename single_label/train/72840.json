{"id":72840,"title":"[SIRT2, a multi-talented deacetylase].","abstract":"Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is an NAD(+) (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent deacetylase. Studies of this protein have often been divergent, highlighting the dependence of pleiotropic effects of SIRT2 on cellular context. The natural polyphenol resveratrol is known to exert opposite actions on neural cells according to their normal or cancerous status. We have recently shown the involvement of SIRT2 in the antiproliferative effects of resveratrol on primary cultures of human glioblastoma stem cells. SIRT2 could become a new therapeutic target.
