{"id":45608,"title":"Single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus the classical four port laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized prospective clinical trial.","abstract":"The objectives of this prospective study were to compare the advantages of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC) versus the classical four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) and to discuss these advantages in the light of current literature.Forty eligible patients were randomized to receive SPLC (Group A, N.=20) and CLC (Group B, N.=20), and investigated with regard to age, sex, BMI (body mass index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score, type of surgery, operative time, per-operative complication, indication for conversion to open surgery, indication for additional trocar placement in SPLC technique, post-operative pain score, additional narcotic analgesic requirement, nausea and vomiting, post-operative complication and length of hospital stay. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for pain scoring in all cases.No significant difference was found among patients in Group A and Group B in terms of age, sex, weight/BMI, ASA score, VAS scores, additional analgesic requirement and length of hospital stay (P>0.05). On the other hand, mean operative time in Group A was significantly (P<0.005) greater than that in Group B. Mean operative time in Group A was observed to be reduced after the first 10 operations. Conversion to open surgery was not required in any of the patients; however, additional trocar placement was required in two patients in Group A due to body habitus and adhesions, and operations were completed laparoscopically.We conclude that SPLC is equally effective as CLC. Patient comfort is increased and pain is decreased as the surgeon gets experienced with the technique.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675241","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"ASA physical status classification system","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASA_physical_status_classification_system"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.730257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.649292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.643209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Narcotic","weight":0.640126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.558188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.436382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.416282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Trocar","weight":0.380891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocar"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.16147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Classical element","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"}]}
