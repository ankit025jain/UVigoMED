{"id":21258,"title":"Partial-limb salvage after persistent infection in the distal femoral prosthesis: straight-plasty--a novel technique.","abstract":"A 35 years old female had giant cell tumour (GCT) of the distal femur for which wide resection and distal femoral endoprosthetic replacement was performed. Massive infection of prosthesis required removal and replacement of the prosthesis with nail antibiotic cement spacer, which also proved to be futile. Ultimately the whole of the infected thigh had to be excised. The limb could be preserved partially using straight-plasty instead of amputation. Patient is well rehabilitated and doing well at a follow-up of 3 years.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613122","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.774578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.765527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.730262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.688752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.56853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.515945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.454352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0426411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"MASSIVE (software)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASSIVE_(software)"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Government College of Technology, Coimbatore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_College_of_Technology,_Coimbatore"},{"name":"A35 autoroute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A35_autoroute"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"}]}
