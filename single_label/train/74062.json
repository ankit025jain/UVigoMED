{"id":74062,"title":"Wnt/?-catenin signalling maintains self-renewal and tumourigenicity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma stem-like cells by activating Oct4.","abstract":"Accumulating evidence suggests that a distinct subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is responsible for tumour initiation and progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Wnt/?-catenin signalling is essential for stem cell regulation and tumourigenesis, but its molecular mechanism in HNSCC CSCs remains unknown. We investigated whether Wnt/?-catenin signalling regulates self-renewal and tumourigenicity of HNSCC stem-like cells in vitro and in vivo. Cytoplasmic/nuclear ?-catenin, a major effector of Wnt/?-catenin signalling, was expressed in a subpopulation of tumour cells in primary HNSCC tissue but in none of normal head and neck tissues. Overexpression of ?-catenin increased proliferation of HNSCC cells and induced dedifferentiation of these cells to cells with stem-like features. Knockdown of ?-catenin in HNSCC stem-like cells blocked their self-renewal capacity, stemness-associated gene expression, chemoresistance, and in vivo tumourigenicity. Furthermore, ?-catenin directly regulates Oct4 transcription in HNSCC stem-like cells. In addition, the effect of shRNA-mediated repression of ?-catenin on CSC traits in HNSCC stem-like cells was reversed by overexpression of Oct4. In patients with HNSCC, higher levels of both cytoplasmic/nuclear ?-catenin and Oct4 correlated with the worst prognosis. These results suggest inhibition of Wnt/?-catenin signalling as a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting HNSCC stem-like cells.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871033","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.793363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.579199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.388693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.314732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.301251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Oct-4","weight":0.204058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oct-4"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.189319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.118927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.098008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Subpopulation","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpopulation"}]}
