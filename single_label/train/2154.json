{"id":2154,"title":"Diagnosis and treatment of achalasia patients: a ten-year review of the clinical features.","abstract":"To study the clinical features, the diagnosis and treatment efficacy with pneumatic balloon dilatation in patients with achalasia in a teaching hospital in Eastern Saudi Arabia.Clinical records of patients with the diagnosis of achalasia during the period from 2001 to 2012 were reviewed. Their presentation, radiologic, monometric and endoscopic findings as well as treatment outcome with pneumatic dilatation were reviewed. RESULTS Results: Thirty-one new patients were diagnosed with achalasia during the study period. The mean age at the diagnosis was 36 years, ranging from 14 to 85 years of age. Male to female ratio was 1.4: 1.7. Five patients while waiting received 20mg of long acting calcium channel blockers (Nifedipine) for four months without any impressive result and asked for pneumatic dilation. Pneumatic dilation in one-year follow-up revealed 91% satisfaction and long term follow-up of 5 to 10 years showed 83% satisfaction of patients. During procedure and follow-up, no significant complication was noted. CONCLUSIONSAchalasia effects all ages in both sexes. Graded Pneumatic Balloon Dilation (PBD) is a safe and effective form of symptomatic treatment of achalasia without significant complication in the hands of experts.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436351","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.627887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.32212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.264251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.250791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Nifedipine","weight":0.135743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifedipine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Esophageal dilatation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_dilatation"},{"name":"Achalasia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achalasia"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Arabian Peninsula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"International Scale of River Difficulty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty"},{"name":"Blocking (American football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(American_football)"},{"name":"Channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_blocker"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Balloon catheter","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_catheter"}]}
