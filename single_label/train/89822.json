{"id":89822,"title":"Femoral neck shaft angle width is associated with hip-fracture risk in males but not independently of femoral neck bone density.","abstract":"To investigate the specificity of the neck shaft angle (NSA) to predict hip fracture in males.We consecutively studied 228 males without fracture and 38 with hip fracture. A further 49 males with spine fracture were studied to evaluate the specificity of NSA for hip-fracture prediction. Femoral neck (FN) bone mineral density (FN-BMD), NSA, hip axis length and FN diameter (FND) were measured in each subject by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Between-mean differences in the studied variables were tested by the unpaired t-test. The ability of NSA to predict hip fracture was tested by logistic regression.Compared with controls, FN-BMD (p?<?0.01) was significantly lower in both groups of males with fractures, whereas FND (p?<?0.01) and NSA (p?=?0.05) were higher only in the hip-fracture group. A significant inverse correlation (p?<?0.01) was found between NSA and FN-BMD. By age-, height- and weight-corrected logistic regression, none of the tested geometric parameters, separately considered from FN-BMD, entered the best model to predict spine fracture, whereas NSA (p?<?0.03) predicted hip fracture together with age (p?<?0.001). When forced into the regression, FN-BMD (p?<?0.001) became the only fracture predictor to enter the best model to predict both fracture types.NSA is associated with hip-fracture risk in males but is not independent of FN-BMD.The lack of ability of NSA to predict hip fracture in males independent of FN-BMD should depend on its inverse correlation with FN-BMD by capturing, as the strongest fracture predictor, some of the effects of NSA on the hip fracture. Conversely, NSA in females does not correlate with FN-BMD but independently predicts hip fractures.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678889","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.73612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.56087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.401326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.381232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.147825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"National Security Agency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Axle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle"},{"name":"Invertible matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Bicycle and motorcycle geometry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_and_motorcycle_geometry"}]}
