{"id":56821,"title":"[Differential diagnostic criteria of accommodative disorders].","abstract":"A total of 150 patients (300 eyes) aged from 6 to 23 with myopia of different degrees were assessed to define differential diagnostic criteria of accommodative disorders such as accommodative insufficiency, habitual excess, and spasm. The patients were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 included 88 patients (175 eyes) with myopia from -0.75 to -8.5 diopters (general group), group 2-23 patients (46 eyes) with accommodative insufficiency, group 3-20 patients (39 eyes) with habitual accommodative excess, and group 4-20 patients (40 eyes) with accommodative spasm. In all cases subjective and objective parameters of accommodation were fully assessed and differential diagnostic criteria identified.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624799","annotations":[{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.110498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Accommodative insufficiency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodative_insufficiency"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Accommodation reflex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_reflex"},{"name":"Accommodation (eye)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_(eye)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"}]}
