{"id":61310,"title":"Harnessing the hidden antitumor power of the MLL-AF4 oncogene to fight leukemia.","abstract":"It is unclear whether the antiproliferative/proapoptotic activity of oncogenes can be pharmacologically reactivated in cancer cells. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Liu and colleagues report that a proteasome inhibitor reactivates an MLL-AF4 controlled antitumor program to kill leukemia cells in an oncogene dose- and cell type-dependent manner.
