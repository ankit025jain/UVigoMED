{"id":67491,"title":"A new treatment for retroperitoneal fibrosis: initial experiences of using Seprafilm® to wrap the ureter.","abstract":"To confirm the efficacy of using Seprafilm® (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA, USA) for wrapping the ureter to treat the ureteric stenosis caused by retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF).Between August 2010 and September 2012, 11 ureters in eight patients with RPF (seven males and one female, mean age 65 years) were treated. The mean (range) length of the narrow segment of the ureter was 30 (10-90) mm. During surgery, after having been released from adhesive tissue, the stenotic segment of the ureter was wrapped with Seprafilm to isolate it from the surrounding tissue. A radiographic follow-up was performed every 6 months using computed tomography, i.v. pyelography and/or (99m) Tc-mercapto-acetylglycyl-glycyl-glycine ((99m) Tc-MAG3) renal scintigraphy.For the unilateral operations, the mean estimated blood loss was 39?mL, and the mean operating time was 154?min. All ureters were isolated from the fibrotic tissue and wrapped with Seprafilm successfully without major complications. During the mean follow-up period of 17 months, no ureteric restenoses were observed in the affected sides, but new stenosis occurred in the contralateral side of the ureter in one patient.Although the follow-up period is still limited, we believe that the use of Seprafilm has the potential to become an effective option in the treatment of ureteric stenosis caused by RPF, when the omentum cannot be used. To establish the relative advantages of using Seprafilm over performing a standard omental wrap, further experimentation will be required to compare the two techniques.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612397","annotations":[{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.794437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Intravenous pyelogram","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_pyelogram"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Scintigraphy","weight":0.681066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintigraphy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.598329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.420694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.223415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Greater omentum","weight":0.204892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal fibrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_fibrosis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Cambridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"}]}
