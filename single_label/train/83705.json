{"id":83705,"title":"Naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, ameliorates arsenic-induced toxicity in Swiss albino mice.","abstract":"In the present study, we evaluated the ameliorative potential of a citrus flavonoid, naringenin (NRG), against experimentally induced arsenic toxicity in Swiss albino mice. NRG (5 and 10 mg kg-l) was administered orally to mice 30 minutes before oral administration of arsenic trioxide (3 mg kg-l) for 14 consecutive days. On day 15, the following parameters were evaluated: body weight; organ weight; hematological profile; serum biochemical profile; hepatic and renal tissue antioxidative parameters including lipid peroxidation, reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, catalase levels; and DNA fragmentation. Co-treatment with NRG markedly and significantly normalized body weights, organ weights, hematological profiles, and serum biochemical profiles and significantly modulated all of the hepatic and renal tissue biochemical parameters and DNA fragmentation in arsenic-intoxicated mice. The present findings indicate that naringenin remarkably ameliorated the effects of arsenic-induced toxicity in albino mice due to its strong antioxidant property.
