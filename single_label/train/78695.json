{"id":78695,"title":"[Comparison of B-mode ultrasonography and computed tomography in the evaluation of maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients].","abstract":"The use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients has been reported recently because of the improvement of the accuracy of ultrasound technology. We thus compared B-mode ultrasonography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients. Thirty-six maxillary sinuses in 18 patients (10 females, 8 males, ages ranging from 7-15 years with an average age of 10.4 years) were examined. Ultrasonography of the maxillary sinus was performed in the horizontal and the vertical direction. Paranasal computed tomography and B-mode ultrasonography were performed within a few days. In some of these patients the maxillary sinuses were examined with a fiberscope. Sensitivity, specificity, false-positive, false-negative, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of B-mode ultrasonography compared with computed tomography were 92.6%, 100%, 0%, 7.4%, 100% and 81.8%, respectively. It appeared that ultrasonography was more sensitive than X-ray imaging, because the sensitivity and specificity of X-ray imaging of the maxillary sinus in pediatric patients compared with CT was reportedly 70-80%. A meaningful correlation of ultrasonography and CT was accepted as an assessment of desease severity. There are some problems with diagnosis by ultrasonography. There is no differentiation of mucosal thicking, cyst and discharge and imaging are less useful in pediatric patients. Because of these reasons, clinical sign and views in the nose are important for a correct diagnosis in pediatric patients. Furthermore, the most suitable age range to diagnose maxillary sinusitis correctly in pediatric patients must be examined.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601097","annotations":[{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.687032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.547072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.463982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.243432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
