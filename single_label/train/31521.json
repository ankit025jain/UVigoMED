{"id":31521,"title":"Goldenhar syndrome - a case report.","abstract":"Goldenhar syndrome is a developmental abnormality of 1st & 2nd branchial arch involving the craniofacial microsomia with ocular & vertebral abnormality. Though most of the cases are sporadic, some familial association is also found in autosomal dominant or recessive manner. Teratogenic effect of some toxic substances may lead to the condition. Ocular abnormalities are epibulbar dermoid, lipodermoid & coloboma. Otic defects are preauricular tags, microtia, anotia & conductive hearing loss. Cardio-pulmonary & genitourinary abnormalities are common associations. Here we have described the case of a 10 years old girl had ocular, auricular & vertebral changes consistent with Goldenhar syndrome, she was managed with multidisciplinary approach and she was symptomatically improved but corrective surgery was planned as schedule of respective department.
