{"id":83332,"title":"Chromosome damage, apoptosis, and necrosis in exfoliated cells of oral mucosa from androgenic anabolic steroids users.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the androgenic anabolic steroids (AAS) for inducing chromosome damage, apoptosis, and necrosis, using the micronucleus test on exfoliated cells from the oral mucosa of AAS users. The sample consisted of 55 male individuals, practitioners of physical exercise divided into two groups: 25 individuals who were users of AAS and 30 individuals in the control group. Cytological analysis included, in addition to micronuclei, counting of broken eggs and degenerative nuclear changes indicative of apoptosis (karyorrhexis, condensed chromatin, and pyknosis) and necrosis (karyolysis in addition to these changes). The statistical analysis did not show differences in occurrences of micronuclei, karyolysis, and broken eggs between the groups. The occurrence of apoptosis was significantly higher in cells from control subjects. The results obtained showed that inhibition of apoptosis was induced by AAS, suggesting that this may be one of the mechanisms contributing toward the association that has been described between use of AAS and the carcinogenic process.
