{"id":68370,"title":"The epidemiology of reno-ureteral stone disease in Koreans: a nationwide population-based study.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the annual incidence of upper tract urolithiasis based on a large population-based study in Korea. This study used a subset of the 2009 Health Insurance and Review and Assessment service-National Patient Sample (HIRA-NPS). The 2009 HIRA-NPS contains data for 1,115,721 patients (711,285 inpatients and 404,436 outpatients) from January 2009 to December 2009. Based on these data, we selected patients who had been diagnosed with urolithiasis using the ICD code and calculated the incidence of urolithiasis. The total number of estimated urolithiasis patients was 219,328. The annual incidence of upper tract urolithiasis was estimated to be 457.02 per 100,000 in the overall population, with 589.09 per 100,000 men and 326.64 per 100,000 women. The male-to-female ratio was about 1.8:1. The annual incidence of urolithiasis in Korea was 457 per 100,000. It is higher than that previously reported in Japan, but lower than that in Western countries.
