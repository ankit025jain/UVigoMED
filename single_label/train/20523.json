{"id":20523,"title":"An overview of the effect and epidemiology of viral central nervous system infections in African children.","abstract":"Viral infections in Africa are common. Polio still persists in the continent despite vaccination campaigns. Many of the common viral infections, such as by the nonpolio enteroviruses, lack effective therapies and leave devastating sequelae to infected neonates and infants. Rarer conditions, such as by West Nile virus, have generated a fascinating conundrum as to how the virus spread to other parts of the world, such as the United States of America. This infection illustrates that these conditions should not be considered isolated to Africa alone but that they represent examples of potentially lethal infections which, although predominantly found in Africa, have the capacity to spread wider afield.
