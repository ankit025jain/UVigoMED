{"id":24900,"title":"Temporal trends in coverage of historical cardiac arrests using a volunteer-based network of automated external defibrillators accessible to laypersons and emergency dispatch centers.","abstract":"Although increased dissemination of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) has been associated with more frequent AED use, the trade-off between the number of deployed AEDs and coverage of cardiac arrests remains unclear. We investigated how volunteer-based AED dissemination affected public cardiac arrest coverage in high- and low-risk areas.All public cardiac arrests (1994-2011) and all registered AEDs (2007-2011) in Copenhagen, Denmark, were identified and geocoded. AED coverage of cardiac arrests was defined as historical arrests ?100 m from an AED. High-risk areas were defined as those with ?1 arrest every 2 years and accounted for 1.0% of the total city area. Of 1864 cardiac arrests, 18.0% (n=335) occurred in high-risk areas throughout the study period. From 2007 to 2011, the number of AEDs and the corresponding coverage of cardiac arrests increased from 36 to 552 and from 2.7% to 32.6%, respectively. The corresponding increase for high-risk areas was from 1 to 30 AEDs and coverage from 5.7% to 51.3%, respectively. Since the establishment of the AED network (2007-2011), few arrests (n=55) have occurred ?100 m from an AED with only 14.5% (n=8) being defibrillated before the arrival of emergency medical services.Despite the lack of a coordinated public access defibrillation program, the number of AEDs increased 15-fold with a corresponding increase in cardiac arrest coverage from 2.7% to 32.6% over a 5-year period. The highest increase in coverage was observed in high-risk areas (from 5.7% to 51.3%). AED networks can be used as useful tools to optimize AED placement in community settings.","date":"2014-11-18","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274002","annotations":[{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Defibrillation","weight":0.675558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.554321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Copenhagen","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Emergency telephone number","weight":0.412117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number"},{"name":"Automated external defibrillator","weight":0.209679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_external_defibrillator"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Public-access television","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-access_television"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"1864","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1864"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"335","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/335"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"100 metres","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Layman","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layman"},{"name":"Dispatch (logistics)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatch_(logistics)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Geocoding","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Trade-off","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Dissemination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissemination"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
