{"id":83751,"title":"Reaching a CNV milestone.","abstract":"A new study compares the copy number variants (CNVs) in 29,085 children with developmental delay to those in 19,584 healthy controls, providing a valuable compilation of such data. The phenotypic variability and wide range of penetrance for these variants present societal challenges regarding how these findings might be incorporated into newborn screening, early intervention and, perhaps, carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25257083","annotations":[{"name":"Developmental disability","weight":0.808981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Newborn screening","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newborn_screening"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Penetrance","weight":0.73179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.238717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.115579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"584","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/584"},{"name":"Milestone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestone"},{"name":"Early childhood intervention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_intervention"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Compilation album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_album"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Uncial 085","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_085"}]}
